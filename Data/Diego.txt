Eric and I
[b]eague anyone?
I had setup appointments to see the nutritionist there at SMC it really motivated see her often for ongoing months. She's rather mean but that's because she cares and she doesn't want to see people who don't want to put in the effort to help themselves
If you need help with nutrition, SMC provides free services to set up monthly/weekly appointments with a nutritionist to assist you on what you need to eat and what's a healthy diet for you
I want what's best for you so I thought this could be of use if you're having trouble with sleep
I've been meaning to try this experiment for some time
Ayy, my team won the whole thing. 1st place in Clash
Possible have a spot open for clash. Midlane. Who's interested?

Teamfight Tactics is out on the PBE, boys. 1v9 me

That and I just don't really have a preference towards any champion I don't want to play against
Stranger danger
I don't ask people if they want me to ban someone for them because I don't want to talk to people online
TFT will be on PBE on June 18th for testing and is expecting to release a week after.

hi jettbo

hello
Hey, guys. I wanted to type out this to group chat to let everyone know what's been up with me. For the greater part of this year I've been depressed and partially suicidal (making multiple attempts at different forms self-harm) and I've just recently been trying to put my best effort forth to recover by going to therapy and making positive choices. With this is mind, I'm going to be keeping to myself for a bit to heal my mental and focus on myself. You still might see me around on League or elsewhere but I don't feel I'm in a good place right now to socialize with others in-person or through calls. I'll try my best to reply to any DM's though. Thanks and goodbye, for now.

I thought it was gonna be free. I didn't realize full price is $20. I don't think it's worth it. After having played in beta too. Me personally, I don't enjoy the Battle Royale genre so much so I'm probably just gonna stick to surviv.io

Each of them costs $14.99 a ticket

The next showing would be at 12:30pm for $13.49. Whilst the one at 11:30am is $7.49.

Cho'Gath also resembles Carnifex from Warhammer 40,000.
I sexually Identify as an the sun. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of slamming hydrogen isotopes into each other to make helium &amp; light and send it through the galaxy. People say to me that a person being a star is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon inflate me with hydrogen and raise my temperature to over 6000 °C. From now on I want you guys to call me “Sol” and respect my right to give you vitamin D and probably sunburns. If you can’t accept me you’re a fusionphobe and need to check your astral privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

Passive: All abilities except Q mark the targets. Mark probably deals bonus dmg when consumed

Q: Dash through an enemy. Resets on kill or when targeting a marked enemy.

W: Absorb all incoming abilities then throws dmg depending on the absorbed amount back in a line.

E: Send out a blade to one location. Reactivate to send a second blade to a different location. Then stuns every enemy between the 2 blades

R: Send out blade that fans out on first enemy hit and cages enemies (kinda like jarvan). Dashing into the cage gives irelia somekind of shield.

I basically told Danech to leave me off on my own
A
Y
We both got there from another party
I couldn't manage to charge my phone at the restaurant though because my phone was having problems
We went to a nearby restaurant to wait out the surged prices and Danech had to go elsewhere, to his gf's home
I was with Oliver and a group but, from the party we were at only a portion of our group left to the next location (A friend's home) and I was  left with Danech and his gf
Mmm...
Places were closed really early in the morning so I had to spend my time walking along a street for an outlet
Well...
1. I couldn't charge my phone
2. Lyft prices were surged
3. I had no directions home

Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture
Or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[x2]
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[x2]
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
I thought not.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?

How come?
You don't enjoy talking to Milo in the group chat because of Parsa's presence?
Again, not something I really want to talk about.
You left the group chat as well? Recently?
It's not Gwyn.
It's not something I really want to talk about, sorry.

At least I'm gonna get that fat paycheck soon, haha
2p - 11p tonight and tomorrow. 12p - 9p Monday
Actually, for the next 3 days lol
I have work tonight TT
Today afternoon? 
How long will you be in town for?
Fair enough
That's up to him though. You're setting these expectations on him to have already learned these concepts he's shown no interest in to apply in his games
I actually think I enjoy it most of all because he has a good middle ground of playing the game for fun and as well thinking proactively
I don't mind it really
Because of his relationship with you.
As well, I'm sure he just doesn't like listening to your shot calls
I'm sure he aims to play the game for fun. While you try to learn from your mistakes each normal game, the lot of us just like to enjoy the game rather than challenge ourselves to do better. Neither approach is bad, just different
Were you flaming?
It be like that sometimes
pata lol
It's pre-school drama.
You're right.
I'm just here chilling. Letting everyone else work it out
I'm not even sure which one where settling in at this point...
Milo, Michael, Parsa, and I are trying to move from the current one to another one.
Milo, Michael, Parsa, and I are trying to move from the current one to another one.

he was pretty edgy
i wanna see more of that eric guy
yeah
I'm not sure how long it's going to air in Cali so I'm probably gonna go either way this Thurs
Oh
Knowing Milo, the price will probably deter him
Or 30m by bus
Like an 11min drive from SM
AMC Century City 15
It's $16.49 a ticket tho
I think I'm planning to go see it in theatres
Are you interested in seeing the My Hero Academia movie? 
Let me know
Bear scene before prayer scene?
Overall, was a good day.
I killed a bear then took a nap.
:EZ: :Clap:
Sounds good.
Apologies, I was at work. Let's play another time
In about an hour or so
Yeah, yeah!
Also tonight
Also tonight
I'll be able to play in the afternoon come weekend
Sorry, I had work yesterday
Does she have name?
A boss, npc, player?
What is it of?
That looks poggers
Mmk, I'll just switch to doing that from here on
Is Skype the best way of reaching you?
Gotcha. Could you check to see if you got mine?
And you haven't been getting ant of my texts?
Just checked, it's the same
Could you remind me again what your number was?
Thanks for holding onto my stuff
Hey, wanna do it tmrw instead? I gave away my shift
I'm working tmrw. We could do Tuesday
Same
We could play Mario Tennis as well
See if you can get in contact with Milo to see if he wants to join too
He went on his way home though
Mmk, Oliver and I got one of the projects done
You can come over when you're ready
Mmk
over
omw 
ok
i'm sure no one will take it
or you could literally just take it out of your car and leave it on your front porch for me to grab
mind if i come over rq and grab it?
so, would be best to get it now or early tmrw morning? or.... after work
i want to return it during my lunch or after work but i'll be leaving around 6am tmrw
how long will you be up for?
i still left my iphone dongle in your car..
Maybe not tonight then ;;
How long you plannin' on stayin' up?
I'm not home atm &gt;&lt;
Did u wanna play later tonight?
I'm no longer on a camp trip

Why you bored, mate?
Now it's 8am!

I wanted to give you that $15 for the KBBQ I mentioned
Hey, are you at home in?
Oh okie, thanks
Oh hey, what was my portion of the bill for the sushi?
Get out there

Tacos don't actually take that long. I could be over within the hour

Is there a program you could suggest for me to improve my reading speed?
Prodigy POGGERS
Product POGGERS

rogue
yo, what's up
no secret reavelsies ;)
i'm sorry, but I can't hang out today
i wouldn't mind
what time will you guys be hanging?
you said you might hang with moises
I wanted to be subtle
rest in peace
idk, i think so
i only say that "cancer = special ed" because I believe it was one of the reasons I was put into the program in the first place
i did get a lot of positives playing games so frequently
you could've possibly asked yourself the same question if you had made the decisions to have a great high school experience
there will always be more good years :)
it's one of the reason I don't think I want to play the game with friends anymore
were you looking to do anything with friends while you have a day or two back in sm?
don't leave boys out of it ;)
there's just too much going on in my mind lately
yea, maybe i'll get stabbed :D
yea, maybe i'll get stapped :D
