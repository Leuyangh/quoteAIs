shocking that an internet candidate has mostly male supporters
Mr. Yang’s support among men tends to outpace his support among women. And in recent months, claims of gender-based discrimination and harassment have surfaced among campaign volunteers, some of whom wrote a letter to Mr. Yang in which they warned of a “bro-culture problem.”

The Yang campaign said it was assessing the allegations, and  would bring in an expert to conduct anti-harassment training.

whereas we get like crazy beautiful and crazy ugly, Russians tend to be generally acceptable
I didn't disagree with the point on men, I just think the west produces higher extremes of beauty in general
it also allows the same for men, though a smaller market
east as in east Europe, not chinaland
is my stance
I suppose I'll concede that capitalism produces higher extremes of beautiful women, but maybe the east produces more generally attractive women
the average Russian is fitter than the average american
They lack makeup certainly, but that isn't to say that they aren't taking care of themselves physically
or at least the expensive ones
but all of em come from east europe
many countries women cant capitalize on it
right, but im saying that could happen anywhere
its cuase they hot af
but many place have no rights
its true they have no rights
why do all the models and sex slaves come from east europe

like i don't get straight hours of sleep
but i also wake up a ton in the night
depends. if i shut everything down well, about 30-hr
nobody said that but you
i can assure you
pizzomegalul
so why sleep if go
ye that was my point, ur always on go
though if I had to take a second wager id also say that eric's trait neuroticism is non-existent
yeah if I had to throw a hypothesis id assume its because before you sleep you're still functioning as if it was 2pm
like r u comp-bed, cause light from screens nukes potential sleeping capabilities unless exhaustion overrides it
but is that a result of activity, or is that a result of just laying there turning
unless ur brain don't work right
so ye it is chill
right, but I doubt you are an hour-2 hour insomniac
so insomniacs could def use drugs to help
not just a sleep disorder
the most recent literature suggest insomnia is 24hr thing
cause like the one causal link I could see would be that insomniacs have constant increased activity
there is, low brain activity, low stress
right, but there is generally an explanation for improper function
Sobreity in that instance would be no foreign chemicals or hormones
objectively speaking
yes
I guess in regards to the current conversation, sobriety is preferable if you don't need to think abstractly often
its raining pretty hard
its alright
and made them hierarchies of popularism
it was a change in perspective from hierarchies of strength
but i don't agree with the word enlightenment
vs the enlightenment everyone has value
that is the natural presupposition
but since we found the way, might as well right?
probably
now might it make us worse as a species?
which means we beat nature in that regard
humans have found medicine to counter that vetting process
weakness is never a good thing, nature is actually meant to vet weakness
i see not one ant rights activist
we kill ants like nothing
depends on the animal
its called the rule of reciprocity
maybe he help later
no reason to murder

Ayahuasca is dank bro, did you melt away?
I played 1 game of ranked flex just to try it, and I no longer have faith in humanity

That’s just objective good news
And I can't actually say exactly why
I really like that one mars
Alright guys I’m almost there
We can prechief horchata if you roll through
Aight get over here
I mean I guess mob
Sounds like an evening I’d be down for
Sir I would but I’m stoned like a biblical whore
What you being hopeful for
Hey you got a return trip chief
Best wishes, I hope the guy you sit next to is not obese
We are out of weed on our end
Yeah 
It’s me Milo Digbo and his girl, I’m not playin skribblio ya cuck
Nah it’s called social
I’m hanging out with Digbo irl
Yeah I think my uncle worked on that
I knocked down top turret in 6 minutes
But when I played him he was more than broken
So idk what iteration of sett is around on pbe
His face looks too real

6 inches

I suppose it depends on your level of resentment in general
If you clearly won after the stick that is
You’d try to merc a motherfucker too
If you got stabbed and we’re still around for a bit
Before it bled out
It’d slap you after you stabbed it
Machete is too big, combat knife could stick it, but it’d at least be a double down
A knife means diddly dick
Unless that knife is poisoned with dart frog toxin
A gorilla would dab on your with a single palm
Like chimpanzees can tear your arms off without trying 
Gorilla slaps him pnce
But that’s unrealistic
Oh yeah sure, nerf the mobility stat
I’d pay to watch
That’s a sport
Magilla gorilla can suck a jaguars barbed dick 
But jaguars can swim, climb trees, stealth, and one shot crocodiles
Tigers are the physically strongest
Their tooth breaks anything 
Jaguars are nuts
Now you want a cat that’d fuck you up
Because they are more inbred than alabama
Léopards pass out after 3 minutes of running
Brains*
It leaves
If a gorilla charges you and you stand still and look it in the eyes 
Understandable
Sleep is like a cruel joke to me
I’m an insomniac on a greyhound
But I’m getting on a greyhound

what an arrogant stance to take
there is broken shit and its fun
alright, after some preliminary testing, dota has gone from a 4/10-8/10
if storm spirit wasn't cancer before
also wait bloodstone provides spell amp
me
you don't own m
well done dota
wait these changes make the game look pretty playable
%
i don't remember that well
but I think he gets better base stats or smth?
and his leveling yeah, he just didn't get ability points
it just had a cycle and followed it
didn't start random
Trust me he makes sense and is pretty cohesive after like 10 min of gameplay
At least that’s how it worked at the play test 
And burn through the cycle to get the other one you want
But you can switch off of one and just hold it
The order is static
When I played with it, it felt like a smite character tbh
Bruh his kit is nutzo 
Birth
and that's why I don't play dota
its a conversation room digbo
conversation room
aight get in here
It also allows for games like Enter the Gungeon, which are local only
And only the owner needs the game
its 4 players
im down to play some crawl or smth
I'm not saying this is something that can be done in an afternoon. But it also doesn't have to be everything they do. It's just if you notice a problem, deal with it now so it's not worse later. Like for example, relationships. If you are in a relationship with someone, and you have a problem with them, ignoring it only breeds resentment which likely dissolves the relationship

Like for example, relationships. If you are in a relationship with someone, and you have a problem with them, ignoring it only breeds resentment which likely dissolves the relationship 
Or at least start talking to yourself or others about it, so you aren't so lost
Or at least approaching it if you can't get all the way there on your own
That's my definition of better
See I also can't agree with that. I think if you give it thought, you can see where things in your life aren't where you want them to be, then work to make them what you want them to be
Even if it's the smallest thing
Just make yourself better today than you were yesterday, and you can only grow 
Just take small steps daily to improve everything, and it wont seem so daunting
Not really, why would you want to live with the looming threat of the future imo
Ignore them and they only grow
It should be worked on at least if not fixed
because then we have no chance if its too late
I think a problem should be fixed when first recognized, not when it becomes too costly
See, I can't agree with that in the slightest
Because we aren't perfect as we are, many of us have glaring issues and inconsistencies, yet we ignore them because they are too difficult to deal with
But currently, many people wish to escape that struggle by joining with a tribe who tells them they are perfect as they are, which I find appalling 
Struggle is good, we only grow from exposure. 
In regards to the first two; What you are is where you are on the road to what you wish to be, but what you wish to be is still an ego. It's an idealized version of yourself you cannot achieve, and you will only be attempting to slam yourself against a constantly escaping wall
What's the substance behind the show
Like I don't care what you say you are, I care what you say beyond that 
And I believe it's to embrace it, but abandon our ego and live with who you are not who you want people to see you as
Right, but if you primarily identify with your unchangeable distinctions, do you not isolate yourself from the rest of the world?
How so?
I can understand it gives them a home and community beyond the one they may feel isolated from or unwanted in, but my stance on the situation is that we should teach everyone to respect the individual, and then we won't need to succumb to that base instinct of tribalism
and humans are very capable of falling to the extemes again, though we like to assume that those instances are in the past
and naturally those are the extremes
Like in the past, when I think of people who ascribe to group identity, we get: The Klan, Nazis, Maoists, etc
It isn't that I disregard so much the benefits, more that I weight the negatives far heavier
I suppose I'm more focused on individual interactions than group identity, but that may just be because I try not to identify with any groups
I mean, my nature has me naturally addictive, and my nature also has me really naturally combative. But I have to withhold that in order to succeed in interactions with less competitive people, regardless of their community
The beauty of humans is that we fight our instincts and overcome them to grow
Naturally, but just because we seek it as a base instinct doesn't mean we have to concede ourselves to it
If that group is something that cannot be elective, say politics
I don't think anyone should identify with any group personally, I think you should be yourself and where you come from/what you are are just chance circumstances
But when I recognize that it can go very much too far and has in many ways, I'm hesitant to ride along
Like I think the move towards PC is a good thing generally for acceptance
And too much of a good thing can be poison
and I despise all ideology
My main greivence stems from what I can see happening to this world, where a single ideology is taking over media/culture
Damn near Princess Frog, Aladdin, and Moana are my top 3 Disney movies
I'm all for diversity in media, as I've said
The ideology I was referencing was the PC storm, not any particular group of people
You never improve the world by flipping the balance of power, you have to equalize it y'know?
and like, while I understand it 95% of the time only comes from a good place and a desire to improve the world
Exactly, I don't think movies should prescribe to an ideology purported by a large vocal minority
It broke the wheel and showed people as equals
which is why Shrek was so classic
Which is the same issue as the damsel in distress
Never do the male characters develop themselves beyond the females
Every scene with a man either has a woman talking, or the man is talking about the woman
extremes on either side are negative
Like imagine a movie with every scene being a fawning women
Fair point, but in regards to that quote. It's propaganda. Men shouldn't concern themselves with anything but women?
quote from the director
Ms Lee recently told The Sunday Times: “I always very proudly say that Frozen is the film that passes the Bechdel test but almost in reverse; there is not one scene with a man not talking about a woman.”

this website is trash but whatever'
and copied only the text
I hit that once
Like, this is mainly a reaffirmation for the adults
isn't*
True, but I also believe that Frozen is saving Daryl in Alabama with Skeeter as his dad
which is a negative thing to teach in the first place
Mmm, but do you think young kids can identify large scale diversity without being taught to recognize race/sex
Very true, but it isn't like Disney doesn't have the resources for what could be their biggest film ever
Very true, but it isn't like Disney doesn't have the resources for what could be their biggest film ever
full of diversity, but all of it feels naturally occuring
But like, think like a Tarentino movie
I forget
That was a character they've had the 90s?
But that wasn't forced, it was natural
Absolutely
Nah this was like 60% politically motivated for brownie points holy
Ah it was a colonizer movie
I mean I don’t doubt it, it’s a Disney movie 
And like it’s not for the kids watching, it’s for the adults who care about diversity quotas 
It just makes little sense when given the setting of the first movie
I wouldn’t say I’m upset about it
Literally shoehorned on instead of naturally occurring plot points
I mean sure, but the only reason both he and the Inuits were added was because of outrage the first movie was too white
Where did makumba come from
But the Inuits made sense
I never seen a nigga in the snow voluntarily 
I suppose, I also heard that they added a black character cause of outrage
Unless it’s like, literally gods
Cause even in Disney movies, grand scale magic has barely if ever existed beyond Jafar and the Genie
To target the goddamn zoomers
Arright, so giving the trailer a watch, they made it an anime plot over a Disney plot
It was emotional, but on second glance it was poorly written
She was 30
thx

I could maybe do one tonight, but I'm working on an essay
smh
miles whatcha got on your computer there Kappa
so this is pointless
ah
how did that come to pass
really?
this just sounds hilarious
and what do they argue about'
if u know
what sizes are they
damb
global warming
those are some stupid digits
league after my stupid digit entering? 
explain
altruism to piss Kappa
my pride is beyond getting shat upon
ill concede that
that's how my simple ooga booga brain works
if its a 10/10
if she asks ill do anything
but casually no
ill do whatever the fuck
like if she was a 10/10
or really thirsty
id have to be stupid drunk
depends
ah
imma give that a no
im enjoying this (promise)
cool bro, same game
its like comparing skins in league
nah I get ya, I just like playing devils advocate
cause its a pooled figure, so 30k is huge
for average income it is tho, so I get his point
hence accounting homework
which neither seems inclined to do
so its circular unless one of us concedes something
and im telling you psychological research and objective studies disagree with your denials
I just deny everything
this is like arguing with you
see
af
boring
af
boring
that's why im in santa cruz
no weather is boring and makes the city feel atemporal
I like weather
imma do my accouting
cool
ah
unless it matters the type of people you beat, in which case everything is relative and this argument is pointless
cause you beat more people
so by your logic youd be happier there
instead of competing here
youd be the only one with it
but in colorado
all of that exists elsewhere
bumfuck nowhere?
and cheap
just because you live by an ocean doesn't make your crazy inflated ideas about financial stability more valid
lake*
overlooking a lkake
5 bedroom house for 2.5 a month
go to like Colorado or some shit
ur still in one of the most expensive cities in the US
but wealth isn't a stimulant
correct, because poverty is a depressant
average US income is ~55k
you live in a bubble
my priorities in life however would likely realign with my current situation, which is impossible for me to predict as an immature underdeveloped 19 year old
then yeah id be chillin
peak? probably not. But if i had a loving family and i got by just fine on that 70k, with no real cause for concern in my life
so something better than nothing'
i don't own a house anywhere now
probably
what the fuck do i know
im 19
i cant tell you my minimum
@blizzard
but it isnt
you think it is
or ubuntu in africa
minimum is ur moms village
XDDDDDDDDDDDDD
MINIMUM
IN SM
shows your absolute disconnect with reality
your definition of reasonable
"reasonable"
there is this thing called biological fulfillment
Over 70k, not a dollar improves happiness
happiness
and the reason comes from the time the guy who makes it puts into it
outside of US at least
but they cost less than $3 per meal
some of the most renowned dishes in the world aren't low quality by any standard
not at all
it only leans towards it
money doesn't guarantee quality
look at the fucking manatee who sang at the LCS finals, Riot has a shit ton of money and she was still garbando
but that doesn't mean the experience is made grandiose by how much money is thrown at it
better food probs
it has more amenities sure
its not objectively better
your good shit
you just don't get the all inclusive luxury package
you can travel the world for like 30k
instead of torpedoing my youth for riches in my middle ages
and instead just enjoy life at all stages
i could NOT kill myself working for all those things
or, here's a thought
and 4 vacation homes
what am i gonna do with 3 cars
i don't want all those things
so they aren't inept in the future and entitled
and learn what a hard days work means
they can earn it themselves
for more things i don't care about?
if im making enough so my needs are covered, and my quality of life is high otherwise, why do i need more money?
not if im making decent money
yeah that's fine by me, so long as im happy with other things
so we'll never agree on this
for me it isnt
your motivation is purely monetary
for purely selfish motivation (cool)
or you could get the satisfaction of doing it yourself
you could
and it isn't just a lack of ambition or laziness, sometimes they just put their effort and attention into non-work or career endeavors
like raising a family, or fishing or some shit
some are comfortable with 70k, some with 700k
which is different for everyone
you have to have enough to be comfortable with your life
i mean it makes me feel good to help, so theres your purely selfish mindset
but for little things why not 
then nah im not doing shit, you gotta learn your own on that end
unless its something pertinent like an assignment
my active mental is, I'd want this done for me, so I'll do it for them if i can
but that isn't my active mentality when i do it
if it subconsciously is just signals looking for satisfaction, then so be it
i genuinely just like making people feel better, or doing something nice for them
id do it anywhere
or more people at least
if its the logical thing
so then why doesn't everyone do it?
i do it cause i wanna be helpful
almost nobody holds the bus door
no i wont
so if it isn't much hassle to me, then why not do it?
i do it tho because i know one small gesture of kindness can really help someone whos having a shit day
like i hold the door on the bus everytime for complete strangers, never will see them again
At least i try to\
I uh, do that all the time
but i did the nice thing
and don't accept it
But what if i don't want their help
I have a friend that thoroughly enjoys it
oral sex
explicitly
what do you get from it
ah
that's accurate but misrepresentative
Altruism only doesn't exist in people with high trait ambition
suffer is a bit extreme
of care for the elderly
im using my example
im not talking charity for standing
but we exhibit it
like care for the elderly is one of the most ridiculous concepts in animals
just because you don't have it doesn't mean it isn't there Kappa :^]
Humans have been showing signs of altruistic, purely helpful behavior since caveman times
That’s the WoW players viewpoint
You just want to
We don’t have to automate them away
But they still can
Birth rate is negative mars
Also reaping the rewards of others is the point of a society, otherwise we’d just be sitting alone with sticks
It’s not like we’re at a deficit of resources though
Not by about 3 billion people

salvery
but i wanna come to an agreement on something, otherwise we're all just bickering for our own amusement
@83 iq people
if you were born poor and white in kentucky, you wouldnt be at usc
nutty indeed
is my opinion
there is always another choice
imma go with stupid Chinese peasants
or just stupid
so are they proud
its not retard or not
they have been fed propaganda
there is always a way
they can always rise up
incidentally
those are the ones we are focused on
with a straight face
tell me that again
median income 12k us
not most
its propaganda
simply because they don't know how little they have
what stops it from cracking again
china is a geographic region that has been split into factions time and time again
nations go up and down
and 50 years ago they were useless trash factories
I understand the power of propaganda
idk how much they'll do on counter expansion tactics
chinas expansion is absolutely worrying, but since the US cant even get basic policy together
increased aggressions are mere shows now adays
with the chance to be undetected by either faction
both factions have nuclear submarines
the only way to win is not to play
define win
why play their game
when people stop working, states shut down
you're doubting the spontaneity of rioting
you don't need technology for a movement
and people are unpredictable, sometimes just one thing is enough to set the whole thing off
the issue with a government like that is that it often pushes its boundries
people eventually get fed up with it
but the largest state in asia is a communist near-totalitarian 1984 state that will likely eventually collapse on itself as all totalitarian states do
if they want to die, their choice
its why patients can refuse medical treatment
because regardless, it was their body and their right
but let them choose nonetheless
not let them flounder
and they will grow into a unique and full person
and their individual nature will flourish
or i can set them on their own path and only act as a guide
and because divorce is more accepted here
at least in western countries, psychologically speaking, having your parents live with you until an old age is detrimental to the health of the marriage
parents is an awkward relationship to have because it imposes a tyrant on the lives of the family
thats why i say i treat them like friends, its a more cordial thing
unless i need a connection
so there is no use to go back after im out of there
my mom just cannot afford me
like i graduate i might be able to move in for at max a year
im off basically
they known the drill
no my parents both left home early
or cause they can see past them
but if they say no i can still say yes
ill take their judgement
no thats my choice
thats how i was raised
thats how they were raised
and that's the love i feel for them, it is absolutely irreplaceable. but both of them understand that what i do with my life is my choice
ill pay the consequence for it sure
but if i wanted to that's my choice
not saying id do everything and anything wierd
they made me yes, but since i can physically do whatever i want with this body, why wouldn't i
but i will not consign myself to simply bow to the whims and wishes of another
thats just a numbers game
but sometimes i disagree with her
i never doubt my mothers wisdom
do they?
i do me
nono
later in life
they want me to do whats best for them
if they loved me they'd let me do what i want
because i can
so imma do what i want to
but im here now
it isn't my fault they fucked
they chose to though
not my*
that's pretty basic
it was my decision that brought a kid into the world, and so i should raise it
but they feel as i will when i have a kid that its my responsibility
they owe me nothing
cause i couldn't have
so they damn well should have fed me
they chose to bring me here
i own them nothing
but i will have to suffer the consequences of not contributing
its my choice whether or not i want to contribute
i am an individual who contributes to a community
either emotionally or physically
its that i ignore those who are of no use to me
its not that i ignore those i don't like
let me actually rephrase that
i ignore those i don't like
i don't ignore everyone around me
when we categorize and condense ourselves into strange tribes, we alienate the possibility of truly thinking as an individual unencumbered by the burdens and expectations of others
when we categorize and condense ourselves into strange tribes, we alienate the possibility of truly thinking as an individual unencumbered by the burdens and expectations of others
or i guess my aunt would be better
because he cares about me as an individual, not as a family member
i could call my uncle today and ask for something, even if i just fought with my mom the day before and ran away from home
half the siblings cant stand one another
you think my family ius close knit?
so do i
im on my own already man
and no inheritance to really speak of
i have connections i probably wont use
i don't though, really
to have a gay son to flaunt to the fashion industry
likely however, if i came out my mom would be happy
to ask me to make such a call on the fly is absurd
i haven't even considered the gravitas of that decision
i don't have to make that choice
tho my mom isn't making me conform to shit so
choices
those are our choice
so for you its worth it to conform, but for me it isnt
everything you do in life is a choice
nobody deserves anything
you have no obligation to meet any expectation set by anyone
i could get 5 tattoos and come home, and my mom would probably be disappointed, but just get over it
we have a deeper bond than that
after 1 fucking argument
because she wouldn't abandon me
no
and no she wouldnt
i already have nothing
but if i believe shes wrong, i wont just accept her word as law 
i will respect her and take her advice to heart
but if my mom tried to tell me that i had to do something after I've moved out, id tell her she was being ridiculous
look i have a great relationship with my parents, and almost nothing will tarnish it
they have wisdom, but wisdom doesn't guarantee opportunity
maybe
if they disagree, but i feel its the right thing, imma do it
even if its risky
i want my path in life to be my own choice
i don't give it up
im still friendly with my parents mind you
my opinion is why wait
i don't have to stay at home
no community
i move away
heres the thing'
my parents opportunities have almost no interest to me
that wont get me a job
that wont get me money
for what
so why do i care
cause they have none
i don't get money from my parents when they die
eric see, wanna know something?
stall like western law
hold out
change isn't quick
and that should be addressed
then you live in an oppressive culture
freedom and individuality are who you are as a person
that is what being free is
not of anyone else
i am property of myself
gimme property
fuck that
why the fuck
that's absolutely absurd to hear in the west
western ideology vs eastern right here
not mine
their choice
i owe nobody anything except whats on my credit card balance
tahts what i care about
not what do you have
who are you
you wanna be objective
who cares about the family ties and what not
i focus on the individual
people helped me, but im me
its mine
who cares
no i dont
who the fuck are they to say what you can do with it
its ur body ur choice
imo
see that's dracionian
across the western world at least
shockingly that's how most parents are
not real love
maybe not as much, there might be some resentment, but love doesn't fade so easily
most people can face their family as the fuck up
you gotta get that
most people aren't like you
you have a very unique mindset eric
for my econ essay
i read that study
because i know im truly happiest when im living how i feel, and shifting my life to a rigid structure would absolutely depress me
i think expunging emotion to focus on monetary gain isn't worth it
it wasn't worth it to me
it wasn't an investment i was willing to make
and the temporary loss wasn't worth the long term gain
to put it shortly, when i did that i literally wanted to kill myself
i did use to tell myself how to feel
more important than money or success through career
because family is super important to me internally
id personally rather live in a worse area, but spend more time with my kids than work really hard and miss their lives
i cant just change what i like
gain
its not because i don't want to do it, its because i find no reason to do it at all
holy shit
and your homework hours
and you could say im just not hardworking enough or that im lazy and don't care to succeed, but truthfully if i had to work your hours at a job id wanna kms
so that means nothing to me
but again i don't place monetary value on success
better monetary lives
i want a reason beyond succeed, a true passion to follow
there is nothing in that for me
but like me personally, i find no meaning in just doing labor to succed
it increases the chemical production of serotonin to force emotions away, and serotonin literally just ages you
btw
actually kill you to do that
it can 
does it always bite at you? or can you fully move on
for you, maybe not. again you might be an exception
ignoring it is (again in most cases) shown to only cause problems later down the line
understand it
OR
based on an analogy to babies
so you correlate... feel with skill
it does
couldn't care if they died or not
many people end up hating their parents, and never speak to them agian
many dont
your culture does
some dont
some do
remember that
your parents are special people
so how do we consider that labor
but you cannot monetize it either
no
is raising a kid easy?
emotional discipline is also understood among us who aren't sociopaths as the ability to take emotions and grow from them
so because its easy its wrong?
or maybe they are built differently
explain that
until; they find love
and are still depressed
but for some, they make their millions
and that's one way to live
again, to you
depression rates among unmarried people are substantially higher
but in 99/100 cases, required for satisfaction later in life
to youi
love is humanity
if you're telling me creative doesn't progress the world, than you and i haven't read the same history books
no they wont
so they dont
most women don't want to be in high tier academia and professions
some have caring minds
some have creative minds
not everyone is academically focused
R E S E A R C H
by what right
who are you to define relevant
sometimes shit aint fair'
in a world where you could literally randomly die tomorrow
so its hard to propose an objective society
but the world is incredibly subjective to factors
humans can only be judged objectively when the world is objective
and we'd like to try something else
i bring them up because your version of thinking is outdated in our opinion
our system just happens to not have to be as difficult and tragic
but they were supported by one system or another, however difficult and tragic
you shouldn't be here either'
if using ur logic, ur ancestors were dumb fucks
chance one of them down the line does
give the others who don't a little boost
where we have a bunch of things
so why not in our society
but the law of averages dictates they wont
they absolutely could
Kappa
quote you tho "great people shitty kids"
not saying I agree with it more
I think I see your position a bit better now
which is just as bad
or don't think they do
but most don't have her will
and she is an incredibly powerful person
erics opinion is that they should be left on the wayside, and ours is they should be helped
erics opinion is that they should be left on the wayside, and ours is they should be helped
or just bad parents
of course you would be disciplined'
you adopted it certainly, but imagine having no parents
because if yes then was it their discipline or yours
question, didnt your parents force you to study when you were young?
then you cant improve as your brain only feedsback negative thoughts
however if the trauma of your experience shatters your mental state
you can force yourself to be better, if you are in a stable mental state
because your discipline neuron is off
neurons have to be trained to turn on, and constant sad means you have no inner discipline
and actively shuts off the motivational neurons
because it rewrites the coding of your brain
its hard to conquer
its a positive feedback loop depression
wallowing is shown to only further depression
I agree that wallowing is to no benefit of anyone
so instead of punshing people for not being like you
it just isnt possible
not everyone can be like you
not everyone is like youy
there seems to be a void of understanding of human psychology here
and live to a purpose
i agree that people should strive forward in life
look, living now is arguably better than ever before in history, why are you wasting energy being mad about some shit you cant change instead of appreciating what you have?
we wouldnt have a society
if everyone desired triumph
thats insanity
in your opinion
a decent living
but when the change is being restricted, that can take a long time
thats how it works yea
dont hold kids to their parents
is our point
they shouldnt suffer as much for it
seems fair to me
compared to you they had half the time to study'
if any of those three changed it would have effected your growth in some way
your parents were wealthy, married, and in a good area
there are so many details and variables in a persons life
everyone has a different world
different world
no police vs police who want you dead
again trying to compare one agianst another is a fools fucking gambit
its all perspective
racism from cops etc
mass crime
lower rates of shooting
your parents also arguably had it better
regardless, you dont have the time to study as much as you did
thats just hard
but the playing field should be evened out, like imagine going to school, while raising a younger brother cause your mom works two jobs
thats an absurd proposition
i agree it shouldnt be wholly neutral
but regardles, why were his parents in their situation?
well his parents vs yours
you wanna talk about laziness
its not even the same game
you
who statistically goes to college
like inner city kid vs you
but we should have the chance to even play the same game is the point
fuck the deserve thing
wish they were never boirn
start to finish
for many their life is absolute suffering
thats all a perspective thing
is this really so good?
do you?
psychologically that is
its unhealthy to keep the images of your parents as unique
they should just be people
but you shouldnt continue to seem them as parents past like 20 y/o
not when their raising you
you should be friends
i would
eric would you say you are close friends with your parents?
its clear he doesnt agree with us
right, so im not gonna try to change him for it
then 500
5000*
500 at the top
but i dont understand how you can demonize a whole race for the actions of maybe at most 500 people
no i believe he understands poverty, he isnt fucking retards
youre focusing on a small racist substrata of caucasians, and blaming the rest of them for your problems with them
fractions
do you know how many ceos there are compared to engineers?
no
be grateful, but dont forget it
ur just an exception
and since that seems to denote intelligence, i suppose china is full of fucking retards
average median income in china is like 12k
proportionally more dirt people in china than here
its asian american culture that breeds their success, not their racial background
lookat china, most of them are useless
except for in niche cases
its all economic
its a hard fucking world, everyone ehre lives in a bubble of welath
im aware
yes, and i commend them for it, its truly remarkable
im aware of why, it was a factor out of your control
that isnt the point, race isnthe important thing to discuss here. The issue is that people dont have access to things that would certainly benefit them in their academic enterprises, and to be objective and fair they should have the same acces regardles
that isnt the point, race isnthe important thing to discuss here. The issue is that people dont have access to things that would certainly benefit them in their academic enterprises, and to be objective and fair they should have the same acces regardles
isnt*
hi im native teach me
elizabeth warren it
yes
TLDR: Is it fair? No. Will you be better off economically than most of us in the end
There seems to be an absolute lack of gratitude for any of the benefits you've been given in life
almost nobody starts with anything
everyone has a rags to riches story
See Americans, Reilgious pioneers to near kings of the world for a time
im mentioning that the tutoring would be beneficial to almost all people
but those are the only people who couldnt do it
though some are just inept by virtue of birth
elevate them to a better world
the point is, we work to try to get them to that point
i agree with his ideas, he's just missing a bit
it does help
rather than*
id have better luck marrying a rich woman if i socialized than went to school;
you are again attributing all work to academia, and thats simply absurd
start a business etc
i just need to work hard
i could be filthy rich and never go to school;
to succeed in AN aspect of life
nono
your just upset
no
have i denied any of it?
if i worked in a child care center, my best trait is compassion
in your work place
you think the greek philsopher diogenes was well educated? he sat naked on the road and shit everywhere, but he had some wit and interesting thought
research is produced through thought
what the humanities is today is a disgrace of its former self however
not at all, humanities is challenging reason and seeing a world beyon
you arent being objective in your argument, but you are preaching an objective stance
your definition of academia is again narrowed into stem
is humanities?
intelligence is reasoning and storing capacity of the mind
intelligence does not in any capacity mean capability
beyond the privelege, to insinuate that someones value is based off their intelligence is absurd
and to monetize intelligence exempts vast swaths of the population
because your view of intelligence seems to come from monetary value
but im not arguing that
youre right
i wouldnt 
bias isnt explicitly racism though, its economic factors as well
otherwise its baised no matter what
i agree, however we cannot be objective if our starting point isnt equal
it should be objective
on average
most of america has shit educational systems
wage gaps are all explained well by parameters which can all be accounted for
unfathomably incorrect
thats just uh
statistically youd still be at home, unemployed
eric, your superiority is based on work you did, but founded on work you didnt do
not a bias tho
exhibit a
median income yes, but you must remember alot of whites are dumb poor
its not fair, but its representitive
They also have some of the highest registered work hours, more degrees, etc
deadass
apparently in Thailand they love hitler
i wasnt saying chinese film, but think like huge box offices from hollywood that get translated like frozen, avengers, etc. like im fairly sure princess frog isnt huge in china
so white people can be in movies in china no problem, but a brother might not get many views or screen time at all
yeah, I was mostly saying the Chinese hate other races, but from what ive found they tend to tolerate white people
in addition however, film is still a business, and the largest consumers of film media are white americans and Chinese, and neither of those demographics is exceptionally positively predisposed towards other races
I think its a failure mostly on Hollywood, specifically with the blockbuster writing teams probably having high lack of diversity
Iglesias, that is
yeah, he wouldn't have fit the target demographic
like why do we segregate our cultures, instead of all just learning from one another
and if he sucks im not gonna be offended, they just gave it a shot
like if you cast a black guy to play a white guy im down if hes super good
its not about a white actor, its about a specific actor to me
its too unique
yeah, like you cant replace goldblum
Fair point, but sometimes the personality is what is desired, and why search for new talent when you have a guy that can do it
its a performance by an actor, not a political statement
obviously look within the pool first, but if you have to pick out of it and change a race who cares
I disagree, sometimes you need a certain voice or personality unique to a person
Look, if RDJ can do it, so can she

But to say that all feeling of love is simply chemicals activating the right pleasure centers a the right times in accordance to your biological reaction simply negates the understanding of novel concepts that shape the human experience
but the concept of it cannot be measured
You can say there it something there we attribute to love
next
it exists
can you measure love

get back into their communities
People should be back into social efforts
like really trying to reform shit like prisons
and out of the work force
and the government will turn to you to pay for them,
they'll become a burden
they wont just passively die
If your inventions start unemploying or impoverishing people en masse
Right on, but the point is
it just isn't worth it to them
But not everyone wants to work and study for 10 years to grind for their high paying job
Some people want to take care of kids, and that's their only wish
But what kinds of responsibilities people adopt changes based on their brain
That is well documented
Sure, but that only lasts for so long
But Eric, beyond your well learned work ethic, your brain is wired like an engineers, which gives you the dible ability to be invested in things
But Eric, beyond your well learned work ethic, your brain is wired like an engineers, which gives you the dible ability to be invested in things
Yeah that's why I'm here as well
or burnout
so they just die
But some people can't deal with that temporary L
Handle your business absolutely
only the city kids
Not the village kids
5$ in funding
that get like
Tf do you have to study with
Imagine you were born in a village in West China
yikeronis
imagine being born a wage slave in China
But how is their happiness?
Yeah
But the thing is, that is always going to be there
Have crazy family lines that get them shit
Similar to how white people in New England
Which many have due to history wealth accumulation in those demographics
It's just access to resources
China-Japan-Korea
Just SE Asians do the best
Or Thai
Not Cambodians
that means they are fucking inept
10% of people are &lt;83 IQ
IQ is average 100, and SD is 15
Look here's the best way to put this
these people cant get to that point
and burnout before they reach comfort
they work
No but
Eric some people's brains aren't wired for intensive periods of high workload
always fall and rebuild
so oligarchies
try those yeehaw motherfuckers
guns are everywhere
and its america
if you bomb them, the world goes against you
there's a lot of them
doesn't matter they have nothing
there would be public outrage
we cant just let them die en masse
so what to do with them
and cannot be retrained
but those people are still alive
We are in a transitioning period where AI can take over
because they aren't fit for anything else
a group of people who fill manual labor jobs
there has always been in human history
theyd burnout and die
some people simply couldnt
beyond want
No race involved
its that their minds aren't built for that intensive labor
it isn't that they are lazy
but another thing is some people just cant do 80 a week
they should be rewarded
but if someone is willing to
don't wanna work 80 hours a week
To me the issue is that most people just y'know
A lot of people do
They’re businesses
Yeah that’s absolutely correct 
What I like to hear 
Using them resources 
Living it up
For sure 
As to what he meant
Yeah no I’m just curious 
Mean*
I just wanna know what you my by it
Eric would you say you’ve gotten your own
I don’t remember much
I was fairly toasted chief
Oh right
Eric just lacerated this guy in league chat
This poor fucker
Nah you shoulda seen it
Some people are really reserved 
I mean not everyone has to project their entire being at all times
It’s cold due to a lack of reciprocation, they only know that sort of conversation due to their upbringing, and so to not do it is quite strange to them, and they may get cold.
Well business is a cutthroat major
I mean they’re people so yeah 
But those are broad and typically self contradictory
9/10 people show at least 2 “psychopathic traits”
1/100 people is a psychopath
Hol up Miles, how much have you spent on DOTA? Since skins seem to be a point of roasting for league
@parsa imagine needing the map to prop up your game because its base mechanics mirror those from the mid 90's

Unless, that is, you work for the government as a statistical economic analyst, but that involves grad school and working for the government
Starting salary for Econ majors tends to be about 55-70k, depending on many factors
And that’s the second highest paying major
Fair enough, however even though mid career salary for Econ is around 100-120k, most can’t achieve that until roughly 10-15 years into their career
For the majority of people who don’t work in the tech field, starting salary is roughly 50-60k, with a 10 year pay increase expectancy of roughly 20k, for the average american
Starting salary OmegaLuL
Fair enough
True, but also starting a rental in the summer is suboptimal, as prices tend to be higher
Well, I guess
I was bamboozled 
Wait I just saw someone who looked exactly like Parsa in high school 
Wow that looks like some Riot balancing
I’m gettin me mallet
Yeah, it would be
Prove it then
I am not lying
I do not though
I do not want one
I do not have one
What's your name?
if you know you know
is it real negus hours?
okay retard
Fair enough.
I appreciate it
i think my mom is coming to get me
I think I have a bit too much stuff for that tbh, but thanks for the offer
If you wanna run it before we go back for summer just lmk
Indeed, and we have those accoutrements here
I think it’s the salt you put in a banger w/ a torch
Oh, indeed.
Indeed, or seeing the 9 eyed space goat
I got a guy for that
Dmt*
Wait Michael do you need some don’t?
It’s just a formality 
I mean nobody checks
But it’s not
But it could be
It’s not an esa
Well yes, but technically no
No they just wanted one 
The suorin tho

I keep hearing Walters voice every time I hear someone say Luna

They were never taught to be paladins, since they focused on Druidic abilities, and had isolated themselves during the creation of the silver hand
His base is pretty big, and since a lot of his audience is younger, and he typically streams from like 10-5, his viewer count on twitch is farrrr low than his fan base
Asmongold pulls around 20k viewers per stream at peak hours, with large events/days having upwards of 35k
Haha, I guess
I’m on phone, autocorrect got me a bit in there
So horde currently has a better chance of winning most BGs due to player skill and gear imbalance 
There is also the fact that due to intense racial bias, the majority of the best player in the game play horde, since for both PVE and PVP the horde races have better racial abilities due to nerds to humans and nelfs
However, as of recent balances, horde is heavily favored on Alterac
Well if I recall correctly, since I’m not just gonna google it cause that’s a bitch move, AB is pretty neutral, since farm can’t be capped as fast as stables, but horde is closer to GM and has easier access to BM
horrifying and hilarious 
guys this is uh
idk why that emoji comes from : ]
just pick thresh, cats just sit in boxes :]
Guys I mean it's easy, there's an auto counter
Yum!
it would create a contrast
you don't want to add a garlic based sauce to a pepper based one
no
what
But I agree much of the bridges are disappointing 
I mean Michael, plastic beach also has a bumping chorus
Yes
Yes
Drugs being food :) at the dining hall like a good boy
Not actually, but I help in it
I do deal drugs.
Which is no bueno
And those would be unsub loans
See but I can’t afford tuition w/o taking more loans
I get like 240 a paycheck from around 13 hours per week, biweekly
Minimum wage asf, but no taxes cause workstudy 
I work during school cause I’m poor and need the 2k work study benefit
Explicitly no
Free drinks is a bit of a far off concept
Also I’m still 18 as fuck
I have a job Mars, it’s just a shit one lma
Fair, but I’m saying I don’t have a fall back at all
Why do you think I’m poor
Lmao nah my parents broke asf
Then it spiraled into this
And it was misinterpreted cause I wrote it a little funky
Cause I made an off hand mention that it’s a poor time to buy one rn
True
Talking not suing
I’m aware they aren’t really investments unless they’re vintage
I know not for investment, I’m suing for base price
Which auto loans are expected to crash in the next year or so
Why I’m saying is, their prices are gonna depreciate when a majority of auto loans fail and nobody is buying cars due to skepticism
I think I wasn’t clear then hol up
But their value is expected to crash soon
Oh certainly not
If ur broke it is
They’re also ninja loaning auto now
But it’s a poor time to buy a new one
I’m aware
Auto loans are defaulting left and right
Or a car
Yea
Stanford is 74k per year
Oh lmao that’s just undergrad, but I think the medical school is cheaper due to something I can’t remember rn
If he graduates undergrad, he has instant access to Stanford grad medical
But he is part of the continuation program they have
I’m aware
Well premed but whatever
Why not go
He got into Stanford medical so like
Medical
300k debt by the end
Yea my friend Weston is doing smth similar at Stanford, full loans
Sooo that’s like comparing the price of a McLaren to a prius
I mean also USC is the most expensive college in the world if I remember correctly 
Yea it’s not bad
I have a job too
It’s all a meme
I’m playin lmao
Do not remind me
It pays tuition essentially for a UC
Roughly
32k per year for college
Eric just do what I do, be poor and have the govt give u free money
It was a meme, but it turned super hostile super quick
Sorry I don’t know where that came from lmao
You 3 inch bitch
So is editing a fuckin message
And most people who aren’t antivax Rn aren’t changing anytime soon
But I’m saying that eventually there won’t be antivaxxers cause all the parents won’t have kids to follow suit in their ideology
I’m aware
It’s also an unsustainable market, as by nature of being antivax they will all die at like age 4
Yea, it’s more for the fun of it than for practicality 
We could hire foreign workers in India or China, but then we are dealing with those kinds of people
Oh most certainly
We help fund other people
For gofundme? Yes
It’s strangers giving money to people with ideas or movements 
We aren’t approaching people, it’s a go fund me style
Like Eric’s saying
Well not explicitly, yea
Cause advertising will be the largest cost
Just a large initial investment
I mean once you set it up it’s pretty passive income
Nothing, and my cousin lives in Kentucky sooo
It’s the poorest state for a reason
Rent a place for like 100 a month
It’s Kentucky. 
Ik
You just have to apply for it online there
Oh you don’t have to love there
Right, but the company itself would be exempt from state tax
Wait, you don’t want to deal with California laws and legislation and tax
Eric if you want I can help you set up the business side of it, but it’d take me a while to figure out how to set a company up in a diff state
Federal laws, especially under current admin, would be pretty lax about this I imagine
The easiest way to avoid that would be to found/base the company in Kentucky or smth to avoid local laws
Itd have to be pretty specific discrimination, like something that would violate a legal statute
Didn’t that already happen? Like flatearthers made a documentary and in it proved the earth was round
So long as nobody can prove they were legitimately hurt or discriminated against, they don’t have a case
But just setting a site up for donations to morally questionable causes is completely fine 
Exactly, the suit in court would be in support of anything illegal, so you couldn’t have like drug or murder things funded 
Wait it’s legal mars
It is legal, just morally questionable 
Maybe I’m wrong 
Do they? I thought donation skimming was capped at like 7
Nah you’d need to do like 5% max, otherwise people would catch it’s a scam
Nobody would do 10, but beyond that it’s super solid
I mean I’m getting a QP on Wednesday so
El Manana?
Although we did just explain the plan on a software that shares info with the NSA, so maybe shake it up a bit
Oh, big truth
Way*
I mean it has a good amount of risk and flaws, but it’s easily the easiest eay
Puppet company, take massive insurance policy as a collateral, chain the puppet companies to a foreign tax haven, lie to investors, have the company fall through, declare bankruptcy in the US, flee abroad, hope to not get extradited

Yep.

At least for me
Yea, the mood and feel of gorillaz is the stories they tell coupled with the variety of their genres
Fair enough, but songs like El Manana and epwrid are standalone fantastic 
I agree it’s definitely a significant point in their work, as it shines with the inclusion of De La Soul, but for me I think something off of Demon Days captures them better
And what is it?
IMO it’s hard to place the best Gorillaz song because of how many genres are utilized
That you should eat like an elephant at souplantation
Is it online or at a place?
3.38% of top hmmm
(yes)
Yea
I mean it’s literally right therr

Eric yea ofc
Fair enough.
Are you available now?
Cause it's probably gonna be sunny and nice, so I was thinking day, but if that doesn't work for you guys lmk
Idk, do you wanna make it a day thing or a night thing
Yeah the beach is def the move, as for when I'm probably gonna go at like 11 or smth
Was that an auto response cause if it was that's terrifying 
Skype has been reading our conversations for like 5 years. Of course it knows
it said "Sand is typing..."
parsa, your name on skype for me is sand person
Maybe the beach if it's nice

Hey now hang on

maybe not today
wait guys we should play civ or AoM or smth later
Big Sad
Holy fuck that was miserable
I haven't had internet for the past 3 days
Or it sounds like tserriednich
waittt a second
Then yes. With all DLC, 60 is worth for me
It's worth sale price + dlc tho for sure
Civ 5 wasn't worth 60 tbh
I like Civ 5 better because I've played it more and I like its visuals better, I like Civ 6 for its creativity and systems
They are totally different
I can't say which I like better
You can't cookie cutter it as hard as Civ 5
Civ 5 is more familiar, but Civ 6 is fun due to the fact it is new, and has more systems and individualism
Different, but still good
for now im learning, so prince difficulty vs AI
my endgame coffers had like 80k gold
I had with like 8 cities, 2000 gpt
His production is turned into gold
He is like Venice but functional
He is a meme
Also there is Mansa Musa
so you can have triple the unit strength around cities n shit
you can stack 3 units on the same tile in an "Army"
but armies can be mega amplified
and early conquering is even easier
the science victory is slower
So the pacing is better, as there is no mid game slog
global warming is a mechanic omegalul
yea
and the new dlc came out 5 days ago
it was on a mega sale
yea
also civ 6 is fun tbh
What is that
I hear that

I wish i could
Indeed
There are groups of people on this planet that need to be eliminated.
^
Just some info
same with carbonated beverages, including alcohol
Or that eating is in general very weird
In addition, while on shrooms, you may find that meat is very hard to eat
that will push it for another hour
Do not drink copious amounts of alcohol while on shrooms. If you want to elongate the experience, when you come down you can smoke a bit of weed
all of the contraband has been acquired
Debatable.
(yes)
theres a distinct difference
im a smuggler
im not a dealer
I mean i'm not tryna be a fiend
as if you were here
im charging you normal rates
im just doing this
but otherwise nah
if you wanna pay me 
i mean
mars is the other one getting shrooms right?
venmo me and ill get ur things
you have 2
I got u
kk
2 grams?
how many u want
each
the sour patches are like 2 tabs
yea
its actually 8, but im picking up the extra dollar cause I told you guys 7 before
and the acid is 7 a sour patch
ye
3.5 grams*
I have you right now at 3.5 shrooms
and how many shrooms
how much acid do you want
michael
very good vro
yes vro I see
ill give you guys my phone number, Venmo 310-310-4036
Is phillip in or no?
Very well then friends
but if you are prepared then its fine
and you have to plan for it
3.5 is a strong trip
for shrooms
3.5 is a trip
also, I just learned, 2 grams is normal dosage
kk
but its equal to like 2 tabs
I think its 7$ a sour patch
cause the guy's acid is really strong'
and how much acid?
3.5 grams is 35 etc etc
so miles, because you want 4 grams, you will pay 40$
you and michael
and how much acid did you want miles?
so everyone venmo me
its 10$ a gram for shrooms
uhhhh, do you know how much that costs?
lemme build a text document
kk
so you want 4
I need to know if phillip is in or not
3.5 is normal dosage
4 x 3.5
for how many people?
17 grams?
Kenji just got a new ounce, so as much as you want, and my friend has unlimited acid
Just a recap, how much did you guys want?
Either way
I never said it wasnt, I'm just saying why people had issues with it
Especially due to the buy in price of 20
And since hearthstone set the standard for online card games, people were put off
I think the main issue I've seen people have with artifact is that it uses the magic the gathering style of buying cards, but since you dont physically get the cards people dont like it
What size?
Nexus Blitz is back boys
He can be 0/10, and still do enough damage to be a threat in a teamfight
He is busted, no kinda
Quote of the day: Guys I put the mushrooms in the DMT bag.
If not I'm pretty sure he has papers too
So yea I think so
We put the acid on sour patch watermelons
Kk
So he said you could all get 4 grams no problem 
Ye
I mean he gets them to sell. But obviously if you want like an ounce he may not be able to do that
Shrooms, idk tell me how much you want, and I'll ask if he can do that, I dont know exactly how much he wants to sell
Literally 200 hits
For acid? A whole bottle
I need an actual quantity
 Lmk how much
For sure
Mhm
$7 per hit of acid, but its stronger acid, just a heads up
Lemme ask for miles
Lemme ask
Yea
I can get you any dosage on a sour patch watermelon 
My friend thom bought a 400$ bottle and a dropper 
I can get that as well
I know they are $10 a gram
Lemme ask
Though if you want shrooms, depending on how much you want I'll need to know how much a few days in advance, so he doesn't sell them all
I'll ask of which is better
He has orange capped ones, and maybe brown ones
I just need to know how much you need
Kenji just got another ounce
I can

 For some reason, any sort of education, intelligence, or actual familiarity with the law, will get you shit-canned off jury duty faster than you can say “I have rights” or “a fair, ethical, working court system, is the backbone of a true democracy”.
Quote from advice of how to get out of jury duty
If you just say you believe in it
I mean, tbf, jury nullification is still the best course of action
2. You can say you have a large scale assignment.
1. They don't know that.
I mean that's true
2. Full-Time Student Status
I attend an accredited college or university and participating in jury duty would make me miss a significant number of classes. Missing classes will prevent me from graduating.

I mean, I think the distinction is that there are retards, and there are people with different opinions. Anyone who ascribes themselves fully to any ideology is retarded af tbh

Would anyone care to play league?
Fair enough.
Oh I can also get DMT

You're going to love this. Trust me. What you're seeing now is my normal state. This is a Super Saiyan. And this... This is what is known as a Super Saiyan that has ascended past a Super Saiyan. Or, you could just call this a Super Saiyan 2. Ooh Ooh. Oh hum, what a useless transformation. You've changed your hair, so what? Hmhmh... Just wait. Has he really found the way to surpass an ascended Saiyan? Is that possible? He must be bluffing. I mean, what would that make him? Double ascended? And this... Eh... What's he doing? Is... To go... Even further... Beyond!

It is with great sadness and incredibly heavy hearts to write that
Verne passed away today.

Verne was an extremely caring individual. He wanted to make everyone
smile, be happy, and laugh. Anybody in need, he would help to any
extent possible. Verne hoped he made a positive change with the
platform he had and worked towards spreading that message everyday.

He inspired people around the world with his drive, determination, and
attitude. On film &amp; television sets, commercial shoots, at comic-con’s
&amp; personal appearances, to his own YouTube videos, he was there to
show everyone what he was capable of doing. Even though his stature
was small and his parents often wondered if he’d be able to reach up
and open doors on his own in his life, he went on to open more doors
for himself and others than anyone could have imagined. He also
touched more peoples hearts than he will ever know.

Verne was also a fighter when it came to his own battles. Over the
years he’s struggled and won, struggled and won, struggled and fought
some more, but unfortunately this time was too much.

During this recent time of adversity he was baptized while surrounded
by his family. The family appreciates that they have this time to
grieve privately.

Depression and Suicide are very serious issues. You never know what
kind of battle someone is going through inside. Be kind to one
another. And always know, it’s never too late to reach out to someone
for help.

In lieu of flowers, please feel free to make a donation in Verne’s
name to either of his two favorite charities; The Starkey Hearing
Foundation and Best Buddies.

200 IQ
Mainly the second paragraph
You do realize that raid is preprogrammed fight, once you learn the timers in phases and time your cool downs at the right time it is 100% win every time. While in arena you also learn timers, time your cool downs but your not fighting one "Garrosh" in every arena fight. You get  a variety of combos of classes in every fight + you add a human aspect of intelligence of surprise (you can never be sure what spell the player will use next, and every player has different way of playing). The random variables of arena plays vs raid just don't compare at all... You throw an empty "fact" without any proof and ignoring a simple math. A bigger number is always much more complex than the smaller one.
I have several Glad titles on my Enh Sham and Feral Druid, and also participate in progression guild who has content on farm, as well as majored in math and computer network/science. So, i don't just speak out of spoof.﻿

It really started after Overwatch's release, at least more often.
Fair enough, but it wasn't EA's model or the popularity of their games that modernized the model.
See PUBG, Fortnite, HOTS, etc
I'm not saying overwatch was the innovator of lootboxes, I am saying however that Overwatch's model is the most popular currently.
And that is the more adapted model as of recent.
Overwatch you don't.
TF2 was different though, TF2 crates dropped in place of items, and offered items with Stranges, hats, etc. Overwatch all extra content is purely random.
After it did it, many other games rapidly did it faster.
Be that as it may, Overwatch was the most popular game to do it.
e.g. Alchemist gold made etc
"stats" as in statistics.
It's a lootcrate system. (Lootcrate as in the company, not the Overwatch loot model.)
Edited previous message: 
We'll see.
We'
But maybe it will be a draw to some people, idk.
A game that is already losing players incentivizing people to spend more money seems like a last ditch effort.
However to switch your business model to a lesser liked variant seems dumb to me.
Not saying that isn't true.
This seems dirty somehow.
I mean for a game like WoW, where you know that is the standard, it is saddening but you know what the requirement for content is. This is a little different to me.
I'm just saying I personally don't like these systems.
I'
I'm not saying it is a poor business model, not in the slightest.

Compare at primes not on currents
You have to look at it from the period. How good was it then compared to how good is this new one now.
Depends, it is always circumstantial.
Holy what the fuck is that Miles.

Every word is worth the read
Koalas are fucking horrible animals.

They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.

Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.

Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...

Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.

Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).

When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.

This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence.

Why?

Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.

Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain:

Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.

An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.

If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.

I have zero absences and tardies, and I want to die
yall is fags
even more limited absences, reintroduced Saturday school for tardies, shit like that
so thanks
because of your guys' year, they implemented a whole load of new rules for seniors
not till second semester can I just not give a fuck
nah first semester grades still matter
Edited previous message: I have school tmrw, but my teachers decided to give me like 2-3 projects due by wednesday

I have school tmrw, but my teachers decided today and tomorrow to give me like 2-3 projects due by wednesday
yea that's also hard mars

papa rip
do you?
well what you gon do now?
rip
you just get home or smth?
I'm doin good
r u okay
mars
no it didn't, that's ha gottem
now
since idk
stress that last ha
say it out loud
its a haHAA joke cause like, he is joking but he isn't opposed if it actually happened
so he just jokes about it
nah but he knows dunk is straight
see but, my point was is that sky is too much of a pussy, so he would be too nervous around other gay people
you seen fight or die
you know I'm right
nah he a punk bitch
but does sky have gay friends?
guy is okay
Michael when would that happen
cause she would suffer at your level 30 normal mmr
then yo girl never playing league again
but if you were playing league w/ your girlfriend, would you not play adc with her support when she starts playing?
that's what I thought
jungle*
you want them jungkle?
most of the cases ive seen
I mean there is an easy explanation. Most girls are introduced by guys who tell them to try this game. they play mid or top or whatever and struggle, so their friend/partner tells them to play support while they adc. they win on support, and so they enjoy it more. then they keep playing support.
hahAAA
team?
is any part of team still here?
feet are strange.
same tbh
T E E M ?
truth
make money then make own business

tmrw 9 probably, but no certainty 
partial extinction may be required before story can progress
is there amazon prime in the mountains?
like maybe a mighty thirsty?
so if we just get a really big sponge? yea?
Aight bet
Im back
if we made it isn't it our word?
we should be
i just did a breath exercise if you know what i meant
i just did a breath exercise if you know what i meant
and better to have muscle but I wouldn't know
nah supposedly it makes you feel more awake
^
^
I mean he used to go
and just swim
nah deadass just hop in the ocean for like an hour or two every weekend
not enough to make breathing hard
its an adventure
gym w/ a tiny bit of weed b4 isn't boring
or, sitting around
because nobody will fuck me for just walking around
hit the elliptical then
yeah olaf is nuts
Monday Night works for me
we'll figure it out or smth
kk
bet
eric if I even laid in bed for a moment id pass out for the whole evening
but im 100% sober
unless im really high
see but im unaccustomed to the autism
possible*
but I would like to start as soon as posible
im saying im literally gonna be retarded
nah
im skipping class, so ill be ready anytime, but i will warn you i have gotten 4 hours of sleep a day for the past 3 days, and i've worked 6:30 hours today
hollow knight
kk
who want league while I still have something to do
its like yeah I have alc but one vice for another is a shit deal
cause I cant even smoke rn
and these power outs are a mega bitch
as ive said, I don't have free time
yeah
but I may or may not even have power so TeeHee
tmrw im free after 9
literally in the 6 hours this conversation has been going on
Me was working all day
mars pick with me or ill rape your corpse
I say earthquakes to the north
and im a smith by trade, so I can help in the reconstruction efforts for fat social credit score
I don't believe so, he had a change of heart
demonstrating our One Day Prime delivery service
carrying 300kg of hash into Daggercourt
lmao
that is
some strength checks
double carrying capacity
advantage to strength checks
its lvl 6 trait is too good for what my playstyle will be
oh wait damn I have to go bear
well im barely a rogue, but hell yeah
bear also makes my strength nutty
bear is better if we just need a tanky boi
elk would be great if I take the charger feat at lvl 8
it was a proud 13 seconds
i thought of him in about 13 seconds
or elk so I can dash around and charge people
I just need to debate now whether I want bear barbarian, so I get resistance to dmg
while being 7'3
and proficiency in sneak
two*
Oh I forgot to mention he has to levels in rogue
he really is a Good Fella(s)
well you'll learn
Mountainsmasher is his nickname from uhhh
last name is his clan name, but he's never met em
so he has dwarf first name
He was raised by dwarves as a smith
The Goliath Barbarian Bamdul 'Mountainsmasher' Orraak
New character is made
Arrright bois
yeah
We seem good, but we have a few moral ambiguities 
I like benevolence for selfish means
more neutral than good, but we aren't animals like in the past
Neutral-Good seems fair
Yeah I won't be evil
so ill reroll
wait nvm a lvl 7 artificer is waaaayyy too complex to jump into
wait nvm a lvl 7 artificer is waaaayyy too complex to jump into
but I also don't wanna be a scrub again
Or still going through with the scale down?
Are we staying at 7?
I think I'll switch to my Artificier, I'll go level him up.
Aight that's fine, bring some more sanity back to the campaign.
If I’m not, we lose mobility in the world, but we gain some liberty
I’ll give to some thought, but here’s my two perspectives. If I stay Morozov, we have a noble which is dope, but we also don’t have the ability to be seen in public doing bad
For sure
Cause that will guide the next part of the discussion
or should I still switch
Should I stay as Morozov?
Aight
was what was meant be that
who's most at fault
I LITERALLY
JUST SAID THAT
Everyone gets pissy, who cares
It isn't a metric of most
serious=grimdark???
then take that shit
i have progeny
'heir' is a loose term
i think all of that is possible outside the noble realm
im gonna say a solid 'death by disease' isn't rare level
u weren't supposed to pick it
^^^

1.5
they wildin
it'd just be us roasting you for being sad
what's there to work with
mars that's a husk of a character
My housemate is back on the league grind
the Chinese village is under attack again
god no guys
Cause I could find 5 ways to fuck that up
it is.
zoomer buh-hoomer
nope
variety
and his name is Xhumer B'humur
You don't even know the guy
Just because my name is ridiculous doesn't mean I am
Fair.
Just think of ways to make it good instead of worrying about what could go wrong
Worry is a misuse of imagination
And a break will be fine
I think it will 
I agree
so I can craft things
melee smith
so im going artificier
then u wanted to play sorc
we were
nah
were rolling chars now
they were playing league
why
miles in call
just talk
rather than spam a chat w/ messages
Understandable
I learned I didn't
I thought I did
Teehee
I'll do any voice acting you need
Hell yeah
On all parts
There was certainly some void of communication
Like if we go on long expiditions, the building will be fine
Of course, but we don't have to always be there
dnd thigns
Listen for rumors and shit
We have the estate, but we can fuck around elsewhere
Like we can also go to different towns
@eric will town scale?

No, because we'll outgrow the town
Like I was thinking Skyrim giants, ooga booga motherfuckers
I thought that we were gonna get smacked up by the giants
Naturally
I mean, basically Morozov would be fucking worthless at level 3
or I suppose flatten it
increase the curve of the game
oh yeah I understood your point
Alright then, I'll be changing characters
Yeah I get it, WoW style number crunch
Perfect
Or that yeah
and just not focus on it
but maintain the estate
I could just change name and house
My character would want no part in that
I understand, but I was saying more in reference to their want for rampant exploration
change character*, not to imply you guys should
But if we do a soft reset, I would like to change characters, as the vicious industrialist Morozov won't work without land
I'm down to do a soft reset. I was asleep for this whole conversation, but here's my input. I think that, much like in Kenshi, attempting to build your own base before you do some solid fucking trade and exploration is nearly impossible.
I spend my week discovering my rune, and then assisting in the reigan scandal by looking for detect magic scrolls in town
For sure
aight then fine
We should see if one of our more holy members can purge ghosts
I agree
Sure.
I'll up you to a crisp 20, you'll not even lay your grubby eyes on my spear for a single moment, and we'll just bar the door.
and to keep your job
you'll get 15
aight bet
Kappa
its a plural question
The abstract concept of arbitrary power isn't a fact of the world, but rather a token viewpoint of a some ideology.
next question is worse
LMAO
but bigotry is obviously wrong
you can be reasonably discriminatory
like those aren't synonyms
stupid survey I have to take for my school
for more specificity 
rune thing w/ hanneman
Eric oh bet, yeah id be down to do it in the TG if Mars would allow, and I'll foot the gold cost if Mars is insistent on being a whiny cuck
We will use a mine when we acquire one, but for now ya know
But would it also be possible to build a quarry nearby for building materials so we can expand the house/build parsa his tower and such?
Eric Huang We'll take the artisans. 
I don
Literally just cauise why not
Can I apply?
Arrright bois, it's time to increase home expenditures and become industrialists
Yeah, and I'd rather not have everything be built by lumber
Would it be possible to conscript some sort of mining group, so we can make our own building materials?
Hmmm
I enjoy home investment
I'm willing to spend so long as income exceeds expenditures and or will by result.
also
They can't speak common
Oh wait now I see why Miles likes Grungs
Understood.
Morally ambiguous individual
Gotcha
I grant you permission to extend the manor and expand your wing.
But they seem like subhuman garbage
I have no particular affection for this individual, frankly I barely even read what was written about them.
Well said.
Why do you deserve it?
He's better than us
Look at him.
Lord Morozov is a fervent industrialist with a high reinvestment policy.
I also grant you permission to expand on any part of the property, and any expansions will be owned by you, and you just pay a tax to me.
Again, you have full permission to act on your own behalf, but understand that I will not be involved in any consequence. In addition, don't touch my money. Those are my rules.
Im busy every Friday night till 8 regardless, but I have no plans for Friday so far
good point
Command: Follow
tho I could fly far away and rain eldritch blasts
yeah I have 0 combat stats
but I just go 500 feet straight up instead
but I gotta go with one of you
like randomly in a mission, dimension door is the way to go
see this is what you don't get
no no no
Dimension Door but I just fuck the angle and fly away
I also have a method of killing one of you
It wasn't intended to be an antagonization, I was just thinking out loud
I'm not sure how much sway your goddess has over the affairs that manifest themselves within the confines of that room
It's a demon basement run by a different church
are we going to kenshi style tie them up, remove food or water from their diet, and constantly spam ask them to join us until they do or die?
just if they're found I didn't know they were there cause I have that deal with the church for no heretics at my property
I mean not "locked up", they can diddle around in the basement and be snuck out by Lautrec at night, idc
according to now
It's a locked door that I've labeled manure storage
(basement)
They can reside in my heretic chamber hidden underground that I've been doing my demon shit in
Id join shit
if we save their lives
Probably
I have to get back to writing my history paper now, but I thought I'd jump in to offer assistance 
But I understand, these tools of aid also extend to Lautrec's needs as well
For the group
Lautrec's crew
and idk if the fall will kill them
So like, I could dimension door you to the cages, but I have no way to get them down
But I can only do two of them
Then my options of assistance extend to Dimension Door, Wall Hack Vision, and Flying to get to them.
I see.
Ahhhh
but I wouldn't recommend that course of action
as a delay
I could wall of flames the platform before they get executed
May I spend the week socializing with nobles and trying to learn what their projects are so I may sabotage/invest in them?
Gentlemen, I have acquired Wall of Fire, Dimension Door, and Ghostly Gaze
Forgive me thinking you were a punk bitch
Oh, with context that makes sense
and I don't even know what youre talking about
mars that's the worst idea ive ever heard
go for the twofer
ill help kill the guards, then go help recover the cart
?
what are the teams now&gt;
and again, permanent silent image
i also have fly if its up high
I have command only Ride 
Our House Words are Nigga Please.
like I want lenny from Of Mice and Men to be a knight
big incentive, but we only gonna knight lkike the giga niggas of peasants
and if any of them are exceptionally successful, their family can be promoted to knights and move up in social classes
And as for the contract, im assuming they cant read, but something along those lines yeah
Understood, fineries will be acquired
Kappa
Indeed, we could just send bands of marauding orcs disguised as knights to pillage heretics in the name of the lord
I'll give them promises of land ownership, but the contract will be heavily skewed in my favor
Indeed, his aptitude will certainly be missed
farm laborers
as for week 2 I would like to disguise myself and sneak into other lords territories and convince their laborers to join our estate
ill go with the knight
i hope you enjoy it
akshually
i need the carry
cmon
mars league
Rat life
i do not
and detect magic
i also have fly
Indeed
I can cast silent image infinetly and at will
dead cat like reflexes
[1571343746] Milo Amoore: im 100% reactionary on this shit

&lt;&lt;&lt; but you have literally the worst reaction time I know of
ill be late, but i should be there
they'd be offended at the sight
reconstruction is quintessential for success
well not really, I don't WANT to hurt people, I just don't mind doing it to get what I want
Hate everyone and do whatever you want
They're straightforward
I like demons
Indeed I am
It’s pretty simple, I ask guldan what it will take in return, he says everything and boom peace 
as it be
aight cool
id like to clear up
I don't know whats happening still
gul'dan might be able to
I was slaving away in the dish room, wholly unaware
No
And we could have something greater
I’ve yet to meet them
I wasn’t aware they had mentals
Or I could ask my demon patron to whip up some green koolaid 
I can’t make it tonight, work extended my shift till 11:30
Ez unpacking
Just flip the boxes upside down
Or sell it in bulk on the Black Market, wherever we could find one.
We can be a supplier :^]
We could make sweet, sticky Israeli Hash, and transport it through the Theives Guild
third level spell, that is
you need a third level bard druid or cleric I think
Miles, nice. I'm down for mass herbology
Wot in titration
so they can be our body bags
imma start a peoples revolution
aight boys
oh EZClap
and mess that guy's shit up
we just gotta find like a main supplier of his grand operation
fires start from sparks
I will burn him to the ground eventually
Fucking Reigan is being a dick
I’m down for this
I was permanently assigned a closing shift on fridays, so I’ll always be late for 7pm
this is a discrete thing
and wanna fuck us up
they would know we're poaching their villagers
see but then
how's that sound
Farmers: Send out infiltrators from the theives guild (pay them for their time) to go to other villages/towns/estates and convice the people to join us (we'll pay 1 gold extra or smth, some incentive, maybe like a land promise contract that is literally impossible to fulfill, but they don't know that because they're illiterate peasant trash, who don't under stand legalise. 

I'm working on a plan rn to get a bunch more farmers
oh dope
Indeed, as long as the transaction is in accordance with the EULA
its just if the feds come callin
yeah no ur chillin
And where else are you gonna get a 15% annual; interest rate
i cant stop that yk
and they take it
E.G church is a bitch and demands money
Tbh i dont care what you do with it
Those are strictly legal protections for myself
Go for it
Try this
Here
I wrote it as much in my favor as possible :^]
if you have an issue with the numbers voice it
generated
but you get interest
you get more as contract worth more
get
Monthly Income Generated - Percent Cut 
I'm working out the gradient system rn
Understandable
just another option, either really seems fine though
Oh and as for the pay, how about %cuts of the revenue? That way it isn't like your taking money directly from the treasury, and you as an individual get a constant flow of income, even while you're away. 
I will counterspell and counter fly
ah
So I didn’t forget Kappa
So I wanted to mention it here
But it was the only issue with the events that came to mind after reqding
Yeah
they're for intimidation
goons aren't for information
yeye
I;m just saying we should get a goon there
money for bribes
he has a lot of money
Yes he can
we should get goons of our own there
income is income
he'll want it back
But regardless of who owns it
which is good
Right 
but we make the money from it right?
I mean sure
and goons cost less that 800 a month
he'll want it back
cause if he owned it
Well done all around, but isn't Reigan gonna kinda, ya know, send goons to the butcher shop
Should bring up options for color
Hold it
If you have the yellow one
Yeah it’s something
✊🏿
Iphone
🤡
There’s the argument
You big gay
Oh?
But technically you didn’t answer your own question either
There’s a reason you’re interested in looking for gay men
Chief all I’m saying is
It hadn’t even started.
I still see PM
Boss
I was at work
Oh, thanks!
ah
that was stated yes
i want your take on the game as a concept
I guessed that
unadulterated 
i want the parsa take on it
what is it
explain
what
l m a o
I do not respond well to challenges
so imma clap back
he said no answer was a yes
ur a fag 
Lmao
It keeps capitalizing Druid 
I have no clue what lone Druid in dots builds
We need Druid to hit full items Kappa
You drink it to get the power in order to kill the demon boss
slavery +0
power +1
drink it and fight the demon boss
That’s a big strength up tho
That’s a big strength up tho
guess*
The fucking Horde is coming I gues
oh dear
Then all we gotta do is dunk a pitlord and we free
yeah thats the plan
Off at 8:15
Or, I get home at 9
I get off at 9 if you guys don’t mind going later into the night friday
Big yikes
I got assigned a shift then just yesterday
I cant
But my classes don’t start for like a week after, I just have to train some new employees
But I’m up on the 12th, and moving in early always has a host of problems, be it internet, electricity, etc
13th
I may be busy with moving back to school, but I’ll keep you posted
well im in a league game, so i may be slightly late
I’ll have a token by the time we start
Morally ambiguous 
What we can do: Heretics. We condemn heretics through our church connections and claim it’s in the name of the lord, but it’s just HP sacs
ooh ooh
That works too
Oh Ye
Later when we get a ton of money,  I can commission a cart of war prisoners/slaves, then kill them before combat in their cages for HP buffs
I just got an idea
Wait
Foreign peasantry may have to make up a bulk of souls 
Indeed
Must maximize party efficiency by giving me all the kills
Gotta get that temp HP on kill ya know
Hell yeah
Fire focus fiendlock
I am
Then say it
It’s actually looking bright
I know the future of league
Aight boys just finished my riot games play testing
flame my teammates so one of them leaves
then leave the game xD

found out late last night
im going to a concert
I do not see you
Yeah, pretty much
Yeah I’ve noticed at times
But I am
I was worried
mars come home
I believe he is there until later at night 
Milo is at work
ease of access
but I thought that was for like
well yeah
I have no clue I thought it was at his place
Oh is it?
or should we eat before
after
parsa are you gonna want to get food
Please add me
Aight then lol
Aight then lol
Forgot to mention that earlier 
Because I’m not available till like 12:30-1ish
I forgot if we did
Wait sorry did we discuss a time? 
Here is my backstory for now.
So wait, UA material is fine right?
It’s gonna learn
Miles no
where are others
I do
But don’t you want to smuggle vast quantities of highly addictive, illegal drugs?
Just pick the genji motherfucker or the engineer
I unlocked all the characters, it’s really easy to do in one run on easy mode
Yea super down
Hey man
id be down
if a negus wants to play risk of rain
however
nah I don't think its happening
That's disappointing.
Understandable
Hey you bunch of ooga booga retards, are we hanging today or nah
it was pretty objective
that was a solid documentary yeah
sure
I don’t think so.
If you guys wanna mob feel free
And I don’t care
I mean I’m home
thennnnnn
if we went to the beach
but like
Fair enough.
but an eighth is supposed to be the o.o trip
that's standard dose
yeah
its 3.5g
eh, 4
cause I have some boomers as well
technically 3 trips
as I have 2 on me
and facilitate one more drop
I could drop with you
My protests have been to no avail
I may be late, my mom is dragging me around places
What's your name?
so not a huge loss tbh
I mean I wont need the shield if I get polearm master in a bit
but that is a terrible idea in the history of our friends group
not to drag you or anything
mars
um
Huzzah!
but get over here
i support this
maintain cultivation
i never said that
and you aren't pimping your hoes
mars do you have a single day you don't work nights
succeed 
don't try
but you should still come over
my anger has subsided
aight then
hot dog
OH
there has to be like a Thursday you aint got shit going on
nigga work gay
its like 5 weeks into summer and i haven't seen you yet
also mars where have you been
"yeah some dude did a line off my ass and he started bleeding from his nose and passed out, good times"
oh i see
^
or do you want some clean
yeah
do you want some return customer cut shit
arguably
it*
i don't have ti
I can get it
cause to my knowledge there is no better r word
gonna utilize erics retards
I offered retards cocaine
Lurking not watching
I just never respond because it’s fucking hilarious to me
I read this chat
Here*
Nigga me right hetr
finicky in what way?
Oh okay, then
without a modem, 2
given you have a modem, it takes maybe 5 minutes
its a router
mars
The thundering chad
Lance Longspear
we now have my new character
It's okay Michael
🐤
Sigh
Raises hand
I’d also prefer 5
Parsa could be a rat, but not the rat
Because that’s an easy find
Now as for miles being the rat
His blame shift seems more like an accusation than a diversion
No I’m saying Eric can’t be the rat
Until now
Well see I was never accused of being a rat 
Reverse psychology
No rats accept the charge of being a rat to divert attention 
But we are
She is
I’m taking statistics over the summer there
Indeed
Hehe
Sorry, surrender monkey tap tap board
Frenchie keyboard haha
Response* 
No réponse?
What are ya some kinda lightweight?
Who takes small hits
Ah I see
We have 5/6 though no?
But detracts from character identity
I mean it introduces more RPG elements
I mean it would make for more travel events and less combat
You should race change to a tortle
I like your confidence.
Mars that’s like asking if I attached a shark fin to my back could I get the amphibious perk
The universe
I see everything
Playing that specific character
I’m only saying it is inadvisable 
I’m not saying it isn’t 
I believe the word I would use to describe that is inadvisable 
I mean it’s Father’s Day, so imma assume no
So I used his
Nah it’s cause I haven’t set up my computer yet
What if you grabbed?
Me small brain too
You weak
You fast
And Milo is at work till 7:30
No
I mean yeah death will certainly adjust my perspective on things
We gonna stay fighter
But then again I hate spellcasters in dnd sooooooo
When I made my char I didn’t know what anyone was playing
We may need a cleric or smth
Tho thinking about it
Bard triple gay
Me fighter
Me fighter
I am not the wisest however 
Not super insane
I rolled decently
a genuine star
a real knee slapper
I have an idea for a character that'll blow your socks off 
I am writing an essay, but when I get back im down
ill be in dialectic
this is so funny
hehexd
cause i dk t wven think i guys know
recap
what the fuck is happening
Lmao 
Next
Happens
In fact I was kinda hyped to play oogway all thru 1 campaign, but shit didn’t line up last night
For what I was there for
Yeah I didn’t mind session 1
And campaign collapsed POG
When she asks me to do something
Damn sorry I don’t say fuck you and throw a chair at my mom 
Like sometimes mothers just be trippin
I mean yeah def mars
Oogway was a wild card
I mean not actively 
This thing was never gonna work
If that’s the straw that broke the camels back tho
I said I was tired and would prefer sunday
Why would I watch erics
I don’t even watch lectures I pay for thru school 
And they get bored
Then the agency is stripped from your players
If u try to influence too much 
Yeah, cause it’s your player’s adventure
As a general statement
You’ll just fuck it up
But if you try it make it “perfect”
Like yeah it’s not gonna go exactly how u want, but damn it was kinda fun so it was aight
That’s the point I’m making
But I came back o hang with friend
Like not everyone was happy lmao
And then it wasnt
But nah I’d stay because it was my friends and it was supposed to be fun
Like u don’t think I don’t like my Friday?
Like u don’t think I had parties n shit?
Instead it consumed my Friday’s while at achool
I should be excited to play dnd
I mean that, but beyond the physical play it’s the aura that surrounds it
Lmaooo it’s like it’s something meant to be fun or something crazzzyyy
even better
word
fall
and 
trip
its just a method of removing her from power legally
we can just have her trip and fall on the road
I mean we only have to say we're gonna put her there
and put her in the work camps
then just accuse her of being a vile seductress
we strip womens right
how about holy nation
berhaps
theres some autism in the chat
team dialectic chat discord
yuh
low and slow
he has 8 char, so he isn't gonna talk too much
bayou af
but its fuckin
yuh
with my grung druid named Ol' Dirty
well you got it
eyyyyy
and that I can get free proficiency on brewers tools
that space hash exists
and wants to 'enlighten' his fellow men with it
my boi found some sick swamp hash and moonshine, got mad buzzed
and it says I gotta confirm w/ u, so here goes
which means I had a "revelation" which caused my return to society
Aight dog so I picked the hermit background
and can I get a character sheet
though I just kidnapped the queen of the southern hive, so im expecting a massive 300 strength mecha-beast named king soon at my base

He left due to being wanted

He questioned a few parts of it
Parsa has some dissapprovals, but ultimately I think he’s a fucking fiesta 
So what do you think about him?

I was charged with cleaning a bowl by finishing it, and the resulting action was too large for normal consumption standards.
We have test driven the wax, it is completely and fully functional.
yea
I bought one of the grams, which I can bring back home potentially, so if you want to try it, I can reserve a portion for you
We got it covered
Nah but see, we good
but we needed an id
for $50
See, the quick and short of it is, my roommates were buying 5 grams of weed wax
I am good, thanks though.
Mars, may I ask a strange favor of you?
ye
they made like 450 off the last one, so $150 profit
250-300
my other roommate Andrew lives in brentwood norcal, and knows a guy who sells the QP for like 300
cause we get it really cheap
he sells the half at the price of the QP
yea
we burned through that qp in 2 weeks
and sell like half of it
yea see, my roommates buy QP's
lmao
see but this is gooooood shit
and my tolerance is typically pretty good

You know how when Milo gets tired, he acts high af? This hamster is that for me.
I simply adore the sheer ecstasy one receives from this hamster.
Eric, I told you, I'm really bored.
I mean, if you call I will play one. But if it doesn't match the pure emotion I received from this hamster I will be very disappointed.
So something so silly and innocent just made my day, and I thought I would share it.
None, I just have a lot of school work, and am generally bored as of lately.
That video has actually given me new life. I am genuinely smiling for the first time in a while
No like I love that video more than myself.
W H O L E S O M E

ger
nig
I'm sorry, but like ive still got school n shit, and its a fuckin thursday
this man raped the gorilla at the san diego zoo'
yup
bibbas?
This nigga
That's illegible Miles.
A license ideally.
Then I'll ask my friend for his fjallarjar.
Not quite, but I could learn.
My grandfather's.
I have a WW2 bugle, I could bring that for the hunt.
No.
It's the champagne of victory.
Mars, rub one out.
That implies entirely unusual circumstances.
"go at it"
It's a personal issue I have always dealt with.
The camera thingy isn't the issue. Even if it's a camera I can't make that same connection without them being there.
Because it's hard for me to have the same connection to a screen as opposed to IRL. If it was in person, I can connect and engage better, where as I physically cannot do that over a screen. Just a personal issue.
's what neutral meant.
My main thing is that it has become me playing WoW, and alt tabbing when it's my turn to do something. So it's not something I'm opposed to doing, but I'm not fully invested. So that
As I have stated prior, If I don't say anything then it works for me. I only mention when things aren't available for me to do.
so I don't decay into obscurity
:)
you write fantasy by makin shit up
I just didn't like his stuff, it had no value to me.
Not that I won't ever associate with them.
I mean Eric I said I don't like them.
I don't like things that are evil, I wont touch them.
if you didn't tell me the answer, I would get it one way or another
Nah I didn't give a shit
I woulda slapped him if I knew eric didn't make him unkillable
that I promptly smashed
it was literally an argument over a chair
I forgot about that until you reminded me
I never got that
No?
lemme restart my comp
also my steam wont open
if your remember that lil nigga
I always just think of Gunter from adventure time
wenk
quack?
I finished my essay
any bibbas wanna play not league
anyways
the numerical aspects could be improved
It still can create difficulty if we cannot find any water
It didn't ruin it, it just made it possible for if we ever reach a desert or barren plains
There are always spells to help with travel
I mean it's like goodberry
anyways, imma go finish my essay, so peace
but it takes him at least 2 days to make it
and they cost nearly a third for twice the amount
They taste just as good if not better than professional stores
Eric, let me give you a good example of good and cheap. Good can come from time. My dad can make traditional French pastries for a fraction of store cost
I just said it doesn't have to be expensive
Not cheap
For medium price
Which you said was impossible
That has been my argument from the start
I'm not saying you are wrong for liking expensive foods, I am only asserting that food can taste good without a high price tag.
Niggers.
People being ignorant can make their food taste better.
You can serve the same steak at 2 different restaurants, but if someone thinks its higher quality it will taste better
This is known throughout the food world
People take price to be a flavor.
I'm not saying that I personally enjoy shitty food. I am only saying that some people enjoy things more than others, and that price isn't a definitive way to measure quality.
was my entire argument
Price/=/taste explicitly
See but the issue with your argument comes to fruition right there, people taste shit differently. Hence why some people love caviar and to others it tastes like wet salt.
But to make the assertation that they cannot taste any difference is absurd.
They would know the difference, but they may like KFC better due to them growing up on it
No, because you don't need special training to taste good vs bad food
100%
like boxed anything is worse
't
I can
Box wine is rubbing alcohol
Not explicitly. Many people like wine tastings, but most people buy an expensive bottle for show over taste
that is easy to tell for everyone
They only alcohol with a real difference would be actual champagne vs cheap champagne
That isn't a good palate, that is specific training. Most people with wealth don't get that training.
this nigga dumb
first lines
Individuals who are unaware of the price do not derive more enjoyment from more expensive wine. In a sample of more than 6,000 blind tastings, we find that the correlation between price and overall rating is small and negative, suggesting that individuals on average enjoy more expensive wines slightly less.
what you just sent me
Did you read
Eric
No, not the guardian article
and adding to that steak is the key one.
Wine is a poor example. The only thing I can say that quality can be determined in is meat.
Eric the value of wine has been proven to be subjective. Some people like expensive bottles due to the price, but even professional wine connoisseurs have never been able to tell the quality of a wine accurately by a blind test.
would be the two higher priced ones
craigs and the polo club
You just made a claim with no evidence at all
that was a retarded statement
Eric I have been to expensive places
Like your mom makes fantastic food, but you claim to not like the majority of it
My point being is that you have very simple dietary habits
any
I don't take your palate seriously
eric a vegetable would kill you
im just saying it isn't the same as a plantain
im not saying it isnt
fried banana is good
plantains maintain their shape and texture due to higher starch
Regular bananas go limp in a pan due to higher sugar levels
No you can't
plantains are fantastic
so fuckin good
Plantains, jerk chicken, couscous, black beans
Ya know what's bomb, Jamaican food.
I was copy pasting multiple parts
I was paraphrasing certain parts of an article
Thai red curries are usually spicier than yellow curries but less spicy than green. However, certain red and yellow curries can look similar in color due to coconut milk, but the base spices are different.
but the red curry base turns yellow due to coconut milk
It isn't naturally yellow based on spices
The large quantities of coconut milk used turn it yellow
yes
yellow
And its cheaper than mcdonalds
Would you call In N Out bad food?
Correct
McDonalds is irrelevant to this conversation
I can't argue that front.
Yes, when the meat is the star of the dish the quality has to be superior.
but that's just me
They just label it, which is where my skepticism comes in for prices=flavor
My main issues with meat at expensive restaurants is that they use tags that cannot be verified easily. Many places claim to sell kobe or wagyu but fail to actually do so.
its like 14$ per entrée, which is normal
that place isn't bad
Tandoor India?
[7:43:05 PM] Jett Amoore:  just learn how to cook it

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
Indian food is none of those
indian food is fucking bomb and its cheap, just learn how to cook it
but still its a funny quote
I mean same
this man is tryna rewrite history
the ultimate meme
feels1965man
I could technincally play right now.
^
I've written one thing, about how Saturday doesn't work for me.

Del Taco*
I believe it starts at 7 parsa
If you made another group chat, you didn't add me to it.

y'all niggas gotta do this in the group chat
