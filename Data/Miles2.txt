I agree, there's no point in reiterating what we all know as it is practically a fact at this point in our minds, to restate it would be merely reaffirming that it is known which would be pointless.
I wasn't even aware that was a possible callsign

"Literal vampire potbelly goblins are hobbling around coming after us"
Damn, I love Pugna. As soon as the match begins and I have the cute little green guy all to myself, I know that nothing's going to stop me from smiling and laughing for the next hour or so.My secret is that I am the lover to that little gooey goblin. Pugna is my everything and he makes me feel ethereal with intimacy. Pugna's kit makes him the ultimate lovemaking machine, like that is what he was built to do. I picture that I am a lonely squire, secluded on my bed in my quarters, when the royal Pugna walks in, removes his Nether Lord's Regalia, and says "The Nether's reach is long!". In this moment, I know that Pugna will have his way with me. First, big P will use his Nether Blast, a powerful burst of pure spine-chilling pleasure that oozes to every crevice of my body, I feel as though I'm going to erupt with ecstasy. That is Pugna's signal that I am his for the taking...Next, He decrepifies me, and suddenly I am on cloud nine, in a surreal frame of body and mind, and every touch of Pugna sends orgasmic chills down my spine, as though I am unable to even move, paralyzed by the insurmountable wave of pleasure overcoming me, it's as though I can't even try to resist, even if I wanted to, and Pugna further asserts his dominance over me and everything I am.By now Pugna has me right where he wants me, I try to tell him to slow down, but I am on his time now. While P is the ultimate lover, I need to know that he owns me. My Green Daddy puts down his nether ward, so now, if I try to resist daddies urges, I will be punished... every squirm and gasp goes noticed, and I am zapped like a canine with a shock collar. It should hurt... but.. it doesn't, with each zap I feel myself coming closer to the edge, and by now daddy knows that I am his. Everything I thought I knew about my body is out the window, none of it belongs to me, it belongs to Pugna now.At this point I am ready to burst, It's as though the slightest movement will bring me to climax, but I know daddy isn't finished with me yet... That's when he does it. Everything else had been child's play compared to what I would experience next. Pugna inhaled deeply, and before I could even react, I was welcomed to the the good suck. Oh my God. The moment Pugna graced me with his suck, I came with such an incredible force and power, the likes of which I have never experienced before. Pugna didn't stop. He kept sucking and sucking and the cum continued to erupt from my member, rope after rope of my juices being absorbed into my Daddy Pugna's throat, and he never missed a single drop. It felt as though my very being was leaving my body and entering his, in the form of my spunk. This orgasmic revelation continued until I was completely dry, and only then was I released from his suck.Daddy wiped his mouth, smiling, I could tell he was pleased with my offering. Since I had been absolutely depleted by him, Pugna tucked me in, and left as swiftly as he had entered. I didn't want it to end, I wished he would walk back in and take me all over again. But I started to doze off, I was so sleepy from my gargantuan orgasm, so I knew I had to catch some bzz's, and just pray that I would dream it all over again...Damn, I love Pugna.

"WHO'S LAUGHING NOW" Todd Howard screams as he crashes through your front door. Awe struck by the presence of Todd you freeze, giving him the chance to pull your wallet out of the pants which house them. He salivates at the mouth as he pulls out 200 of your hard earned dollars and places the wad in his back pocket. Todd leans in close and whispers "Thank you for supporting our business", he turns toward the door which he entered through and begins to slide towards it. Before leaving the man himself Todd Howard looks back at you and drops three copies of The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim at your feet. As your regain the ability to move you see Todd throw a wink your way and flies off into sky, presumably headed to the next person who dared to say that there were "too many versions of Skyrim".

You're at home one afternoon by yourself, just relaxing on the couch. You hear a soft knock at the door. You open it, not knowing quite what to expect. It's Todd Howard. He's young and super fit, just out of game developer school and full of youthful optimism. He's wearing this sexy outfit that makes him look like he's from the medieval ages or like he's going to a renaissance fair. He tells you about a new game he just made, Skyrim. He's going door to door selling his game, just trying to get enough money together for his first game studio.You tell him, hey, good luck partner, but I don't need any more games right now. You're about to shut the door when he takes a step forward. You don't understand, he explains, he really, really wants to sell you a copy of Skyrim. In fact, he'd do just about anything to close the deal...

Which is much more in the vein of old style RPG's
Yeah I think that's true
Old style RPG's like that are essentially like reading books in how they play, its very much a cerebral passive experience
I think it was for the popularity, because I don't think a top-down isometric RPG would have appealed to as wide an audience as a shooter would have.

That's because Dark Souls 2 was inconsistent in its theme, so much so that they brought Miyazaki in to try and make sense of the direction. Also I wouldn't say its self-contained as the implication of the ending is that your decision ultimately doesn't matter, there will be someone else who comes along, gets all the lord souls and reignites the first flame or lets it die out

They literally don't even touch upon the theme of fire or what the constant struggle to not die is really indicative of (which is the darkness within ourselves, because we internalize our want and therefore internalize the origin of our suffering; our suffering being the want to struggle against fate. which is why maintaining humanity/ember is such an important mechanic)
This video makes me sad, because they use Dark Souls 2 as the main body of evidence and go utterly off base as they use a Freudian-Oedipus complex to explain imagery which is probably unintentional and if it is intentional is a ancillary theme rather than a guiding theme of the game
There's that, but there's also a planet in Rogue Trader which is essentially mobile hive-cities waging an endless war with each other

I was sitting in the theater, Watching Incredibles 2, and I was quietly eating some beans, keeping to my self, like normal, when, half way through the movie, a black teenager came and sat in the same isle as me, a few seats away from me. I notice him and my hands go cold. My brow starts to sweat. I can’t even focus on the movie. I knew I had to put my beans away. I slowly bent over, trying to place my beans on the floor, out of sight, behind my tote bag that contained 47 more cans of beans. I set the open can on the floor. I started to slowly sit back up in my seat, but then, because I ate so many beans, it happened. During a very quiet scene, I farted so loud, it must’ve set a record. It was a juicy one, and I felt every person in the theater look at me. Some chuckled. But the one I was most worried about was the black teenager. I knew I had to get out of there. But, as I frantically stood up, I tripped on the bag of beans. The bag toppled over, and the 47 cans of beans rolled onto the floor. I turned and tried to run out of there, but it was too late. He saw. In a deep booming voice, he yelled “THIS NIGGA EATING BEANS!” Everyone started laughing. I fell to the floor, defeated. I started weeping. Never have I been so embarrassed. Only Later, after the movie ended, I was able to walk out of there. I am committing suicide after I finish writing this. This is a warning. You don’t think it can happen to you, but it can. Moral of the story: don’t go in a movie theater where a black teenager is present, whilst eating beans.

Not gonna lie the weird dancing alien thing is not my favorite meme, its basically a poor man's surreal meme without any of the charming post-ironicness

I said its kind of plagiarism, theres a clear line when you're literally directly making something in imitation of something else, but making a slight alteration is somewhat disingenuous because its like referencing something without committing to the idea of it while still essentially trying to create that very same thing
I didn't realize Miyazaki literally took them directly from Berserk
Ahh, thou'rt a bibber
Would you prefer the earth to be a waterworld or become an ash wasteland?
That's something I can get behind
I'm not sure why this is an issue
I'm not against mods, I'm just saying in this case mods shouldn't have been necessary to begin with
I'm saying there shouldn't be a need for the mod in the first place, even if its there, it represents a shortcoming of the developer to actually make a functioning game.
That's what I mean
Why should the consumer be the one to bear that burden when its the dev's job to make it work in the first place?
Also, that's a false equivalency because your assuming the car works opitmally
It was their first time porting something to PC, but that doesn't mean it gets a pass
The base game wasn't actually developed to its fullest.
I mean, can you really say a game is better than another if you have to go in and basically fix it yourself to enjoy it significantly more?
I mean, if we're talking strictly PC, DS Remastered is better than the original release because the original PC release was actually horribly ported and they realized that and fixed it in remastered.

Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream.A murky, forgotten land.A place where shrooms may mend your ailing mind.You will lose everything...... once Branded.The symbol of the stoner.An augur of dankness.Your past. Your future. Your very light.None will have meaning, and you won't even care.By then, you'll be something other than human.A thing that feeds on smoke.A Hollow who tokes.Long ago, in a walled off land, far to the north, a great king built a great kingdom.I believe they called it Angeles National Forest.Perhaps you're familiar.No, how could you be.But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate.Without really knowing why...Like a moth drawn to a flame.Your weed will burn in anguish.Time after time.For that is your fate.The fate of the high.

In the Age of Ancients the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray joints, Ashtrays, and Everlasting Dickheads. But then there was Weed and with weed came disparity. Toke and cough, life and death, and of course, rip and chop. Then from the dank, They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the Weed. Michael, the First of the Dank, The Witch of Memelo and his Daughters of Chops, Mars, the Lord of Lighters, and his faithful stoners. And the Furtive Philip, so easily forgotten.With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dickheads. Mars's mighty tokes peeled apart their thick hides. The Witches weaved great smokestorms. Michael unleashed a miasma of dank and wheeze. And Diego the Thiccness betrayed his own, and the Dickheads were no more.Thus began the Age of Weed. But soon the flames will fade and only Dark will remain. Even now there are only embers, and man sees not weed, but only empty bowls. And amongst the smoking are seen, carriers of the accursed Danksign.Yes, indeed. The Danksign brands the smoking. And in this land, the smoking are corralled and led to the Angeles Forest, where they are locked away, to await the end of the world... This is your fate.Only, in the ancient legends it is stated, that one day an smoking shall be chosen to leave the smoking asylum, in pilgrimage, to the land of ancient lords, Lordran.

A new name for something quite old. Men with taste &amp; style who know about fashion, art, and culture have always existed. In past centuries, these kinds of men were in the uppercrust of society (more leisure time). Technology has enabled men with more leisure time, so less wealthy males can now fuss over their looks and aesthetics almost as much as women. An American Metrosexual is like your average European male. In France or Italy, men can be manly and work on cars and know about art and fashion at the same time. They are cool with that and don't need some special name for the less "masculine" side. In the U.S. we think men all have to be eithrt dumb gorillas or homosexuals. There is some grey area! There is an emphasis on not being pretentious in america that itself becomes a kind of pretentiousness. Men who dabble in vanity or in lofty romantic concerns seem less like men when in fact, they are probably better lovers to women than their traditional counterpart.

Can I play as a rogue trader of the House Duquesne?
Rogue Trader is a tabletop RPG based in Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 setting. It is published by Fantasy Flight Games and is part of their 40k-based RPG line, making it mechanically very similar to and broadly compatible with Dark Heresy, Deathwatch, Black Crusade, and Only War (and all their associated splatbooks).

The basic premise of the game has the players take on the roles of a Rogue Trader and his retinue of trusted officers (altogether referred to as "Explorers" by the system) as the command staff of a starship. With wealth, privilege and power undreamt of by the average Imperial citizen, Rogue Traders are free to explore the galaxy at the edges and, indeed, beyond the boundaries of established Imperial space. Far from the prying eyes of the Inquisition or other Imperial authorities, any method of furthering their interests and making profit is on the cards; strip-mining, enslaving, or depopulating entire worlds are within the realms of possibility, and many crews are not above consorting with xenos or even turning to heretical means to achieve their own ends. The players are free to role play the crew of a noble exploration vessel, a band of piratical looters, or anything in between - more than any other in the 40K RPG line, Rogue Trader offers players the most freedom and choice as to what they wish to achieve and how they go about doing it. Generally speaking, Rogue Traders answer to no-one but themselves and their Warrant of Trade lets them go where they please with relative impunity (although it still behooves them to try and stay in the Imperium's good graces).

From a mechanical perspective, the game is extremely similar to FFG's other 40K RPG lines and is, broadly speaking, mechanically compatible with them - Rogue Trader in fact includes rules and guidelines for porting Dark Heresy characters into a Rogue Trader game, and vice-versa (having been published before Deathwatch it makes no mention of that line, but is still compatible). The core of the rules is a percentile system where the player must roll a d100 and compare to a target number (usually a character attribute plus/minus relevant modifiers) to determine whether or not (and how well) they succeed at a given task. As in Dark Heresy, characters find themselves belonging to a specific career path which determines the availability of advances that can be purchased with their earned experience, although the careers in Rogue Trader are significantly more powerful than the Dark Heresy counterparts - a starting-rank RT character is considered roughly equivalent to a DH character with 5000XP. Character generation is much more involved than in Dark Heresy, with the players deciding on a multi-step "origin path" for their character (each step of which provides a choice of options with various mechanical effects).

Other notable differences in Rogue Trader's rules as compared to Dark Heresy include a significantly reworked system for psychic powers and techniques (RT uses attribute tests instead of DH's power dice), in-depth rules for the operation of starships and ship-to-ship combat, and the abandonment of the concrete monetary system in DH for the abstract "Profit Factor", which is tested against when making purchases, Rogue Traders being so fantastically wealthy and their wealth so diversely invested and represented that a simple monetary value becomes meaningless. Abstract rules for undertaking profit-making endeavors such as establishing trade routes and other commercial objectives are also included.
It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die. 

Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse. 

To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods. note

Jett, I'm sorry, but popular opinion says you're racist
and got enslaved
and the reason black people die
youre racist
if not
have you seen the movie?
jett
Actually, they very deliberately point out that they kill and or forcibly remove any intruders who wandered in
David, how did you like the movie?
that's why
BECUZ THEY WAS KANGZ
LuL
holograms
Like, he was the thinly veiled racism the movie was okay with having on the screen
I love that he was just literally a BLM member and a dickhead
I'm not even joking
Eggxactly
He was like a member of Black Live Matter
he was literally "I hate white people" the character
the villain was great
not if you're juiced up on vibranium flower juice
He was just the unabashed militant black panther from the 60's
Michael B jordans character was my favorite
Yeah, but its not like a huge part of the story, its the fluff
its just a motif
the panther was like icing on the cake
idk wtf that was about
yeah
that its conducive to life
Its also implied the vibranium has some kind of passive effect on people
I mean, Tony stark is literally just a genius and he made all kinds of shit by himself
^
That's kind of part of the disbelief you need to suspend if you want to watch the movie
I'm not trying to defend the entire movie, but their being advanced didn't bother me
That's how the world works today, the people in power today are only in power because they were lucky enough to have enough of the right resources to exploit and take advantage of
The idea is geographic luck, they were lucky enough to get vibranium to arrive at those advances
Because it literally is a concession that they aren't unique, they were just lucky enough to get vibranium and use it
I actually really like that vibranium exists though, and that's why they are advanced
They could have used the aesthetic, theres nothing wrong with that, its just they made it everything, it wasn't just an aesthetic
which kind of ruined it
they could have actually have explored how a society would look if it was incredibly advanced, instead they opted for catering to the lowest common denominator
But like
yeeeh
Like those two ideas clashed
Also, one of my biggest problems was the primitive tribal practices combined with "the most advanced society on earth" thing
for no good reason
literally everyone just fought each other
Like, the end of the movie
It meandered a bit too much and made strange decisions
it was ok to watch
Yeah, black panther really wasn't crazy

Moon Sugar Records' up-and-coming rapper Lydia (stylized as LYDIA) really loves trappin'. In a new banger produced by Whiterun's very own beatsmith $eptims, the rapper lays smoking hot bars about her love for the trap. In a recent interview with Drums 1 Tamriel, where her single off of the fabled upcoming "Burdens" EP premiered worldwide, Lydia discussed how she could end her beef with the fellow rapper Nazeem (whose "Clouds" EP is in the making), Maven Black-Briar and her producer collective, TheBlackBriiars. "Burdens" EP is set for a release in early 4E 207.

Brockhampton's Saturation 3 is a modern masterpiece that warps the conventions of modern hip-hop and challenges mainstream styles. With its usage of unique beats and social commentary on the plight of negroes in America it delivers insightful revelations and entertaining sounds with uncompromising verve. Kevin Abstract leads the charge on this installment with his clean and direct lyrics, with Merlyn bringing up the rear with his perspective on social expectations and dealing with them while achieving dreams.

OST
this is another song from the OSt
I didn't think I'd like it, but I was surprised because they actually didn't go as hard on the rap to other genre ratio I thought they would
Like one song was an interlude and it was this kind of techno afro pop thing
listening to the entire soundtrack is pretty good, because it gives you a range of styles not just rap
that one was like one of the few rap songs
that's why I liked it

You guys excited for the new han solo movie?
Supposedly, the majority of conversations the Coens had with Jeff Bridges during the making of The Big Lebowski was whether or not The Dude had gotten high before the scene, and that’s pretty much it.
And the newer game can't be considered better than the older game because its not contemporary to the older game
Right, but what I'm saying is, its stupid to say a newer game is better than an older game because that older game was cutting edge for that time.
Because I thought about it
Is it fair to compare older games to newer games?

You subhuman baboon. You literal nigger.

How dare you speak, you swarthy jungle monkey. How dare you open your big lipped, rim encrusted, menthol cigarette smelling mouth?

You are human trash, Diego Tyrone LeShawn de Maradona. Universally despised, derided and mocked. Your nationality and skin tone offers no hope to the world that South America can ever prosper. Crawl back in to the Brazilian jungle you came out of, you literal orangutan.

I hope you decide to sail your grandfathers skip to the Falklands and rape some sheep, as is in the negroes nature. It would still be the whitest pussy you ever had. Give Nigel and Robert a chance for some target practice, your sole use to the world. Argentinians obsession with a few windswept islands in the Atlantic is hilarious but sad. Coincidentally its the only worthwhile contribution Argentina has made to the medical field. The MUH LAS MALVINAS sentiment in the average negro Argentinian is both an early warning sign of autism in children, and early on set Alzheimer's in adults.

Take your black hairy fingers off your keyboard, and never talk about the human species again, you mockery of our supposed shared ancestor.. No amount of olive oil and wheat flour slabbed on your face every morning will make you white. It's about as delusional of an idea as your daydreams of European heritage.

You nigger.

You make Bolivia look like a beacon of civilisation.

You are the Baltimore of South America.

Go fertilise the pampas with you and your families corpses, its the best you can hope for in life. For the first time in your life, nigger, you have a job making food for beings vastly superior to yourself. Uruguayan cattle. Coincidentally, it would be the first time an Argentinian "man" provided for a family.

Die, Diego. No one would miss you. Except for Australian Aboriginals, who now would have no one to make them look good.

I think Campbell was largely correct in that there are underlying universal themes that transcend cultural boundaries
Georgie boy strikes again
“In the three decades since I discovered The Hero with a Thousand Faces, it has continued to fascinate and inspire me. Joseph Campbell peers through centuries and shows us that we are all connected by a basic need to hear stories and understand ourselves. As a book, it is wonderful to read; as illumination into the human condition, it is a revelation.”

I'm not trollin David, I'm just speaking the #sponsored truth
Culture 2 is the synthesis of years of work and effort on the part of the Atlanta-based rap trio, Migos, to deliver a product that far exceeds the expectations of fans and Critics alike. In keeping with this idea, Migos has crafted an 106 minute album that subverts expectations and deviates from the established formula for mainstream rap. Their use of cerebral vocabulary and evocative imagery combine to give listeners an experience unlike any other. The use of creative word play and unorthodox instrumentals works together to cement their position as the "shapers of the culture". Their understated personalities and shy charm sets them apart from their contemporaries as does their innovative style. Culture 2 explores new topics like how much wealth they have accrued from their careers and the lavish lifestyles they live due to that; in addition to their sale of cocaine to build a capital base to allow them to launch their rap careers. All in all, the album is a smash hit and deserves to be quintuple platinum a million times over.
Culture 2 is better than Culture

alright guys, when are we all free for Memelo's campaign extravaganza
He waddled into the room, "do you kno we dey" he said. The terrified student's faces slowly turned to confusion and curiosity, everyone in the library looked at each other. Their minds were racing, until they were slightly calmed by focusing on a girl who had crawled out from her hiding spot and was standing in front of Knuckles. Sweat was rolling from her forehead, but she finally spoke after what seemed like a few minutes- "teach me your ways" she said. Knuckles gazed at her with squinty eyes, after clicking his tongue and summoning the rest of his tribe, they all roared "TE QUEEN" proclaiming the student as their new queen.

The girl was shocked, but she slowly realized what had happened, for she knew of the way her whole life. The library was silent, she could hear the other student's breathing. She looked at the a pair of students under the table opposite of where she was originally hiding, they had bullied her her entire life. The cubicles near the table had other students, all of which who riots in streets naked with megaphones screaming nonsense. She peered back behind her to her new tribe, and with a devilish grin, uttered something to them.

The Knuckles tribe waddled over to the students who were staring wide-eyed and breathing heavily, some of which were starting to cry. "You do not kno de wey" the Knuckles tribe said in unison to the trembling students, and proceeded to violently spit on them with their acidic spit. After what seemed like ages, nothing remained of the students but tattered clothes, melted flesh, and silicon. The girl strutted over to the piles and ransacked for anything she could find, as if looking for something.

After checking the piles she frowned, "it's not here" she muttered. "Tribe, I have one last job for you" she said, the bruddas head's peeked into her direction and listened with the utmost care. After biting her lip and lifting herself off the ground, she said to the tribe "search the rest of the library and classrooms, show anybody you come across de wey." With a snap of her fingers, the tribes waddled quickly and scattered in all directions. She closed her eyes and heard the screams of others and the clicking and spitting sounds of her tribe, she smiled.﻿

8. The First Order are terrible villains, like absoloutely hilariously bad, they are bumblingly incompetent to the point where I have to ask how they even got past the starting line. Yes the Empire could be hilariously incompetent but they felt like a genuine threat. Darth Vader got shit done, the Emperor got shit done, and Grand Moff Tarkin had a genuine commanding presence and aura of authority to him. With the First Order, Hux is a fucking joke and while I like Kylo alot, he is not going to be able to function as a main villain, he can't lead an army and he's a shitty and inept leader, I think that's part of why he's as good as he is as a character, but as a main villain and a threat to the protaganists? No. The only two people in the First Order who felt threatening in the slightest were Snoke and Phasma, and they are both killed off hilariously easily. All we have left now is Hux and Kylo, both of whom are terrible leaders. 

9. The Resistance are terrible good guys. The entire movie just felt like the Resistance and the First Order attempting to out-stupid each other, one military blunder after another. The only reason Holdo's plan failed was because she didn't tell Poe, if she did, DJ wouldn't have been on the Supremacy to tell the FO about the shuttles. Poe wasn't a mook either, he was fairly high ranked, and considering he managed to convince the others to mutiny he had a fairly high standing in the Resistance. Also they were going faster than the pursuing fleet, couldn't they just send some ships out to go get more fuel and just keep outrunning the star destroyers until they're too far away to track and then just jump away? That would've saved the fleet or at the very least the Raddus itself. Over the course of the film Holdo's ineptitude causes the entire Resistance to be killed off. Also the bombers in the opening are absoloute trash, a squadron of Y-Wings or B-Wings could've done the exact same thing much easier. 
and finally, probably the most important point... 

10. I have zero interest in what happens in the next movie now. The First Order are led by morons, the Resistance is practically wiped out, Quite frankly the galaxy is fucked. Rey knows jackshit about the Jedi, there's no way she can rebuild the order. She's going to make all of the exact same mistakes Luke did. Kylo and Hux are idiots. There's no way they're going to be able to maintain control over an army like that. We've essentially just got a worse version of the Original Trilogy now, only the Empire idiots and the Rebels have little more than the dirt under their boots. I don't envy JJ Abrams right now, no matter how hard he tries to fix this, there is no way he's going to be able to salvage this trainwreck. Episode 9 is going to be a dumpster fire, the whole movie is going to collapse under it's own weight, it might even take the entire franchise down with it. Mark my words, The Last Jedi may have some serious issues, but it will practically be a masterpiece compared to Episode 9. 

I know this was long, but that's my two cents on the matter. 

IHE, on the miniscule chance you actually see this, you're still one of my favourite youtubers, and yes, it is fucking stupid to insult other people over a fucking movie, no hard feelings, I just needed to get my thoughts on the matter out into the open.﻿
4. The worldbuilding is terrible, and as someone who really appreciates good worldbuilding this absoloutely guts me and the lack of internal consistency makes it hard for me to get invested in the story, this isn't really a Rian Johnson problem TFA had this issue as well (though to be fair it wasn't as bad). In TFA it's established that the First Order is a small but fanatical and extremely dedicated remnant of the Empire that was destroyed in ROTJ, the vast majority of the galaxy is under the governance of the New Republic with the FO as a fringe group of extremist insurgents, led by a mysterious new dark side user only known as Snoke, meanwhile the NR doesn't take the threat seriously so Leia leads here own strike force known as "The Resistance" to take the fight to them. Sounds like a great setup doesn't it? What do they with this? In TFA, the First Order somehow manage to pull ANOTHER even BIGGER death star out of their asses and then blast the NR's capital planet to pieces. Ignoring the question of how they managed to make a weapon that big or that powerful, it then gets destroyed comically easily by a tiny fleet. Naturally one would assume that this would be a Pearl Harbour or even 9/11 style event to the New Republic, where they become well too aware of the threat and public outcry moves the New Republic to retaliate with full force. Going into this film I wanted to see the full scale war between the New Republic (spearheaded by Leia's Resistance) and the First Order. I go into the movie expecting a conflict grander and bigger in scale than the war in the OT and what do I get? The first line of the movie is "THE FIRST ORDER REIGNS", apparently in the 5 or so minutes between the two movies the First Order managed to take over the entire galaxy without a fight. What? WHAT!??!?!? You're seriously telling me that everyone just kinda said "yeah ok welcome back Empire", yes the NR's capital is destroyed but there were plenty of extremely wealthy and powerful planets that could easily hold their own and maybe even form a coalition against the FO. Instead the slate has been wiped clean for another boring-ass small band of Rebels vs big evil Empire storyline, which was already perfected in the OT, this is literally going around in circles. Oh also they have an even bigger Super Star Destroyer just to add insult to injury. 

5. There's no focus for the trilogy. It's come out now that nobody ever had an idea for where to take this trilogy from the start, in fact Rian Johnson hadn't even seen TFA until AFTER he started writing TLJ, there's no coherent vision, even in the Prequels George knew where he wanted to take the story from the start. Everyone involved in this trilogy, Rian Johnson, JJ Abrams and some people from Lucasfilm should've sat down and decided at the start "Oke doke, here's what we're gonna do, characters start at X and they end at Y, the journey from X to Y is very flexible and you can do whatever you want for the next 3 movies, but we need to get them to THIS end-point". As it stands, there is a TON of dropped plot points and disconnects between the two movies, at the very least RJ should've at least kept Abrams around to just advise on this and that. There's quite a few examples of this, but my personal favourite is why did Luke leave the map if he didn't want to be found? Also the Knights of Ren were teased in EP. VIII but they just don't show up in this. This is also Abram's fault as well though, in fact it's pretty much the entirety of Lucasfilm's fault altogether, the Lucasfilm story group was set up to make sure all new star wars content was consistent, and they've failed utterly at that. I think RJ actually did a fairly ok job with what he was given, and I do not envy JJ's task of cleaing up this massive fucking mess in Episode 9. You could say that they're paying the price for their lack of vision. 

6. It renders the OT completely moot and pointless. Luke becomes an asshole and Han and Leia divorce, oh and then Han dies. The New Republic they helped build is destroyed in one hit and now the First Order rules everything again. Oh and if Rey attempts to rebuild the Jedi she is doomed to fail, if Luke fucking Skywalker couldn't do it then there is no way she can. The New Republic that the OT crew fought so hard to restore was a bureacratic shit-show (in the books this is shown in detail that it's a corrupt failing mess) that was annihilated in one shot, the Rebellion is now a dozen people and the Millennium Falcon, I would say we've gone right back to A New Hope, but even in A New Hope the Rebels had more people and ships and there were more Jedi alive. 

7. I still think Mark Hamill hates this movie, yeah he took it back but I think he really just didn't want to fuel a giant hate mob forming against the movie. If you look at the way he talks in interviews it's very clear he's obviously disappointed with the way things have turned out, the way his demeanor just sinks whenever he talks about it is honestly really depressing. Obviously I can't tell what's going through his head, but personally there's alot more evidence one way than the other.
Disclaimer: I don't have anything against IHE, he's still one of my favourite youtubers, he's very polite and well spoken for a guy called I Hate Everything, i'm just throwing my two cents in here tbh. 

I absoloutely despised TLJ, no hard feelings or anger really, but I wanted to explain my point of view and why I think it's just kind of a trainwreck: 

1. I actually agree with alot of the defenses here, the soundtrack and performances were great, and in fact this is probably the best looking star wars film. I just think there's alot more wrong with the movie. The usage of the force doesn't bother me either, Luke's projection ability is relatively tame compared to some of the batshit insane crap that's being pulled in the expanded universe (there's an old comic where Palpatine uses the force to open a fucking wormhole and another sith lord Naga Sadow causes a sun to fucking supernova using the force, and don't get me started on Darth Nihilus the one-man-planet-killer). As for Kylo he's honestly the only character I give a shit about anymore, the scenes where he's talking with Rey are some of the best in the movie. I did not go into this film wanting to hate it, I don't go into films wanting to hate them, if I don't think i'm going to get any enjoyment out of them I don't watch them. Also the Throne room scene is absoloutely brilliant, it's the best scene in the whole movie. I hated the Battle of Crait, but that's only because of how much better the Throne Room was in comparison. 

2. When it comes to the physics, it's not the fact that it's unrealistic that bugs me, it's that it's not internally consistent. Internal consistency is, IMO, far more important than realism in alot of cases when it comes to worldbuilding, I don't care if their's sound in space as long as there is always sound in space for example. The problem with TLJ's physics isn't that they're unrealistic, it's that they go against previously established in-universe logic. The bombers in the opening aren't bad because they're unrealistic, they're bad because in the OT the rebels had far better bombers (Y-Wings and B-Wings, even Rogue One got this right) that could do the exact same job much better than these newer ones, the film isn't bad because it defies real life logic, it's bad because it defies previously established star wars logic, it's the same with the stupid chase between the fleets, we've seen cannons able to fire at much further distances before, plus the First Order must have HUNDREDS of fighters on board that fleet, if they deployed all of them the Resistance ship would be annihilated in a matter of minutes. It'd be like if they made a Lord of the Rings movie where someone breaks the one ring with their bare hands. 

3. Luke, I hated what they did to Luke. It's not the fact that he failed at rebuilding the order, it's not even the fact that he tried to kill Kylo Ren, it's the fact that he ran away like a little bitch without even warning anyone that Kylo, an extremely powerful dark side user. was on the loose. I actually really like the idea of Luke getting overconfident and fucking up in a huge way like that, and then having to come to terms with that. It is perfectly in character for Luke to make a stupid impulsive fuck-up in a panic like that, but it's also in his character to do everything that he could to fix it, to atone for his mistakes and deal with the monster he created. Luke didn't learn from his failure, he didn't even try to do anything to fix it, he ran away and hid like a little bitch, and the only reason he did that was because the script needed him to so Rey could show up and fix everything years later. Luke's arc isn't one of learning from his failure, if it was he would've picked himself up much sooner and confronted Kylo/Ben, but he doesn't do that, he sits around, does nothing and then Rey comes along later and basically just fixes everything for him.

but now hes gay and edgy
varus' story is revenge with a bow
that's a tilt and a half
AND THEY DIDNT EVEN REWORK HIM
I felt like his lore was fine, and then they utterly gutted it and made it infinitely more convoluted than it needed to be to get the point across
were incredibly uninspired
the varus lore rewrites
oh yeah
they practically say, it would be bad if they did something with those nukes
also, its retarded that there was an entire section of the U-boat they just found that happens to be massive and also have nukes
its acutally kind of tilting how squishy you are considering you are wearing power armor
yeeeeeeee
haven't
I really have got that far
im still in the U-boat at the very beginning
and remind them I'm a member of the merchants guild ✡️( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)✡️

Like it wasn't very satisfying
and they like tell all that with a cinematic and then just cut to him being freed and then say DLC LuL
well, the ending for talion was basically he becomes a ringwraith, but then gets freed when Frodo destroys the ring
but like, the ending was ok, they just like basically say at the end that the story is complete for talion but there will be 2 other dlc that continue the story
focus
but yeah, the story isn't the foucs
eggcellent dota 2 meme
the ending for Shadow of War was ok

Almost as ridiculous as the new Mercedes Benz E-Class Sedan.
The most intelligent E-Class family of all time welcomes a powerful new member to the dynasty. The E400 Sedan model arrives this year, boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque — the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury.
Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips — even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. "Car-to-X" Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles — effectively allowing it to "see" around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems — including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC®, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist — feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them.
Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display, while touch controls, aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once. It's a vehicle that demands to be driven, and more than lives up to the dream.
Look for the E400 4MATIC Sedan at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter, with an MSRP of $58,900.﻿
Waiting for Midas mode has been ridiculous.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Hentai. The romance is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of tentacle physics most of the "action" will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the nuanced idea of feminimity, which is deftly woven into the visuals - the japanese philosophy of censorship really puts emphasis on imagination. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these ideas, to realize that they're not just erotic - they say something deep about human sexuality. As a consequence people who dislike Hentai truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the eye opening nature of watching Yaoi as a straight male, which only a true intellectual could appreciate without any form of arousal. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as a quintessential part of japanese culture unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a tentacle rape tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Monkey King Aghs upgrade: Monkey King's brilliant prowess in brewing allows him to open up his bar, called the Monkey King Bar. Any enemy hero in a nearby radius will give 1500 gold to the Monkey King because they will buy his beer and wine. They will also get a half duration Drunken Haze. If a hero can't afford it, they go into debt, granting Monkey King the Monkey King Bar effects on that specific hero until the next time Monkey King uses the ability and they can actually afford it.
It's an instant cast spell with an 800 radius. 100 second cooldown.
Note: Brewmaster pays double and does not get the Dunken Haze effect.

What defines a living legend? Is it the countless world-breaking achievements they've gathered throughout the ages? The wondrous feats and acts of absolute marvel they've performed for the masses to spectate in sheer bewilderment? Or is it the benevolent love and warm recollection received from every other organism that exists on this rock we call Earth until the days of recorded history meets its end? There's only one way to find out, and that's right here, right now...
its a win-win meme

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
If anyone brings up Rick and Morty theyre gonna get the copy pasta

We're hitting V A P O R levels that shouldn't even be possible
Why is IMAQTPIE such an extraordinarily good player? One might think it's because of his unparalleled reflexes or his deepest understanding of every single detail and its impact on the game. The truth is IMAQTPIE is miles ahead of every single player in the competition when it comes down to the memes. He only harvests the freshest and spiciest memes there are, consequently destroying the enemy players with their second hand memes.
Are you guys doing anything for Halloween?

Dota 2 is a game that stressed heavily on microagressing your opponents throughout various avenues of play and situations. This can stem from as far back as character selection and team cohesion/composition. It is vital that dota 2 players take advantage of not only counter picking against certain matchups, but also sealing down their own win conditions and strategy for the match overall. When looking at QT and the gangs initial movements and play, they mistepped in so many directions that the game is almost irreparable at this point in time. For one, they have close to no actual comprehension of how their characters work. This alongside the fact that they do not understand the mechanics of crowd control and queueing up abilities will ultimately set them on the path to defeat.
But I think Scarra is why they aren't winning in dotes
especially mid
I prefer early game dota to league because you can make some spicy plays
harassing someone falls under laning
and then grouping late game and team fighting
I mean, league is literally sitting in lane and trying to outfarm your opponent
yeah, its generally about grouping and utilizing your advantages early
yeah, its generally about grouping and utilizing your advantages early
we won a game yesterday with jett as a carry and parsa and I as supports and we carried the shit out of the game
cooperation
yeah, its about team play
that's if you let the enemy get ahead and basically don't grow a brain and try to kill them by grouping and ganking
if you know youll get a kill or two out of it
so its not terrible
I mean, realistically even in league the enemy wont take the tower incredibly fast early in the game
yeah, but like the concepts are the same, its just the medium that's different
like rotating 2 people to a lane early game and ganking is a really easy way to get kills
and coordinating
like grouping for anything
grouping is just like 100x more effective in general in dota
if you want
you can
theyre getting thrashed by the infamous all-pick pudge
and they aren't counter ganking
they aren't grouping
the boys need to group
ye
yeah
IT REQUIRES A MASTAS TOUCH
the movement and attacks take getting use to though
If you think about basic moba mechanics its intuitive
Its not that unintuitive, you just have to think a bit more
he's playing it like league
he just skilled the wrong abilty
noooooooooooooo
they just actually don't know wtf they are doing
they do have backstory

Look at how EFFORTLESSLY pro player Micheal "Imaqtpie" Santana decimates the competition now that Scarra has been removed from the equation, i have read over 300 r/leaugeoflegends threads suggesting that the downfall of deltafox rests on scarra and scarra alone and this game proves E V E R Y T H I N G. If delta fox had listened to reddit pro analysts earlier and cut off the dead weight, maybe Imaqtpie could have had a chance at dragging his team to victory.﻿

Imaqtpie's Wild Ride is a dark ride at Disneyland Park, formerly located at the Magic Kingdom. Originally planned to be a roller coaster, it became a dark ride attraction because Walt Disney only wanted attractions that were appropriate for all ages. It is one of the few remaining attractions that was operational on the park's opening day in 1955 (although the current version of the ride opened in 1983). The ride's story is based on Disney's adaptation of The Wind in the Willows (1908), one of the two segments of the film The Adventures of Ichabod and Imaqtpie (1949). It is currently operating in Fantasyland

In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire Deltafox.

That's my friend from New Zealand adjusting to American culture. He doesn't usually stand on bins, but when he does it's to combat homophobia through a method of humour we enjoy thoroughly called 'sarcasm'.

Many of you out there probably believe fidget spinners are just a toy for kids. You don't know how fucking wrong you are. Fidget spinners were designed for elite athletes, CEOs, and arch-bishops. Kids merely adopted the spinning, we were born in it, moulded by it. I've dedicated my life to fidget spinners. I'm the only truly certified grand master of fidget spinners; 3 time defending world champion WWE belt holder of fidget spinning. So I believe I'm the only one truly qualified to tell you that fidget spinning is a man's sport, a man's man's sport. I was once a boy who became a man thanks to fidget spinning and also natural ageing. Do you wanna know the difference between me and a child? I'm 22 fucking years old, children are usually under 12 depending on what criteria you're gonna use to classify someone as a child so think about that shit next time you see me torpedoing down a slip-and-slide sailing at an atom splitting 68 miles per hour going straight into a fucking brick wall of manliness. How do I stay in top physical form becoming this athletic specimen that scientists can't even fully understand? Well it's all thanks to my work out and diet regimen now it'd make even LeBron James shit his pants. I wake up at 4 am everyday , I drink 3 raw eggs with the side of pancakes with nails sprinkled on top and also a glass of straight uranium, I then grab my favourite fidget spinner: the triple XL gold-plated 25 pound weighted Air-Cutter supreme-extreme maximum turbo overdrive spagooter with pump-action assault-grip as well as extended magazines and a silencer, I've even customised this bad boy with a laser dot sight with a green finish as well as further modifications including hydraulics, 3D printing capability as well as doubling as a fax machine. This is a gadget straight out of MI6, this is right brewed up from fucking Q laboratories- he used to make gadgets for 007 now he's making fidget spinners for me. Do you still think this is a fad for kids you fucking troglodyte? Well I guess if that's how you wanna spin this story, but for me I know the truth, I know that this game was made for men and I've mastered it. I live and breathe fidget spinning. So go ahead, play your boring traditional sports like football and baseball. I'll just be here like a diss-jockey spinning it. Hugh! Sorry about that, just had to dodge another vagina that was just tossed at me, it's not easy being the grand master of fidget spinning.﻿

No need to become uncivilized apes looks at Mars pointedly
For my lady's PAINting
Mars, you need to chill
Not gonna lie, that's what I did
If you really don't want to get gud it, I would just cheese him with the twinblades
It's literally just about being patient
Gael's fight was straightforward, and very much about not greeding out
Miyazaki can't keep the money at bay for too long
I'm sure they will make another one
They literally looked at what made Dark Souls Dark Souls and then changed the names of most things so they could try and explore different themes that weren't consistent with the first one
League's philosophy of change for changes sake is aids
League's philosophy of change for changes sake it aids

This is some retrograde autism I've just read
I'm always down to cletus

We're just riding ur dick because we want you to come mars
Wait mars we moved the dates so that you'd be able to come
So we're not doing it
Because we're down to plan it out if everyone else is going full autismo
Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream.A murky, forgotten land.A place where shrooms may mend your ailing mind.You will lose everything...... once Branded.The symbol of the stoner.An augur of dankness.Your past. Your future. Your very light.None will have meaning, and you won't even care.By then, you'll be something other than human.A thing that feeds on smoke.A Hollow who tokes.Long ago, in a walled off land, far to the north, a great king built a great kingdom.I believe they called it Angeles National Forest.Perhaps you're familiar.No, how could you be.But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate.Without really knowing why...Like a moth drawn to a flame.Your weed will burn in anguish.Time after time.For that is your fate.The fate of the high.

In the Age of Ancients the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray joints, Ashtrays, and Everlasting Dickheads. But then there was Weed and with weed came disparity. Toke and cough, life and death, and of course, rip and chop. Then from the dank, They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the Weed. Michael, the First of the Dank, The Witch of Memelo and his Daughters of Chops, Mars, the Lord of Lighters, and his faithful stoners. And the Furtive Philip, so easily forgotten.With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dickheads. Mars's mighty tokes peeled apart their thick hides. The Witches weaved great smokestorms. Michael unleashed a miasma of dank and wheeze. And Diego the Thiccness betrayed his own, and the Dickheads were no more.Thus began the Age of Weed. But soon the flames will fade and only Dark will remain. Even now there are only embers, and man sees not weed, but only empty bowls. And amongst the smoking are seen, carriers of the accursed Danksign.Yes, indeed. The Danksign brands the smoking. And in this land, the smoking are corralled and led to the Angeles Forest, where they are locked away, to await the end of the world... This is your fate.Only, in the ancient legends it is stated, that one day an smoking shall be chosen to leave the smoking asylum, in pilgrimage, to the land of ancient lords, Lordran.

yes indeed. it is called lothric where the transitory lands of the lords of cinder converge. in venturing north the pilgrims discovered the truth of the old words: "the fire fades and the lords go without thrones." when the link of the fire is threatened the bell tolls unearthing the old lords of cinders from their graves... aldrich saint of the deep... farron's undead legion the abyss watchers... and the reclusive lord of the profaned capital yhorm the giant... only in truth... the lords will abandon their thrones... and the unkindled will rise. nameless accursed undead unfit even to be cinder. and so it is that ash seeketh embers
I don't remember what video I saw that on
Shiiiiiieeeet, I'd have the hottest pickin song
I'd take the deal
I wish you guys could see any of the Marvel movies at Brooklyn's Court Street Stadium 12 multiplex. Opening weekends are an epic study in the most ultra-ghetto behavior imaginable, and I'm a black guy saying that. Sometimes one just has to give up trying to watch the movie and instead allow oneself to be entertained by the antics of mannerless assholes who allow their children to run rampant, scream and yell at each other, sometimes come to physical blows with other audience members and the theater's staff, and smuggle in vast amounts of booze, along with huge orders from the Popeye's and McDonald's locations just up the street. The place is documentary-worthy. 
"Only a fucking nigger would hit Cletus and rip the whole bowl without sharing" - that time I told Michael about Cletus and the niggers
You're banned
I was thinking of Taking FAt rips from Lil Cletus and then we'd hike
I'm honestly down for whatever
You're missing out
Wait'
thatll keep them away
We'll just bring boxed wine
You're phonetic, but I haven't replaced you with a w yet

Well, if we're going to Joshua Tree there might not be much of a forest to yodel in
Also, I'm down to do a shroom tea if you guys would prefer that
Doesn't that decrease one's will to live?

who wanted to fuck every female and shemale
I mean, he's fairly tame for a thot
I dab on thee
As Duke of the Northeastern Empire
keep up the good work fellas
yeh
Yeah, I don't have a problem with that
I just don't think they should be classified as elves though is what I'm saying, because that doesn't really explain what they are. They seem like they are much more than elves given their capabilities.
yeah, that's what I mean
in the context of this world
I just don't like that they're elves, because that seems strange
I'm really talking about the eladrin at this point
I just think there's a fine line with making something interesting but powerful, and making something grossly overpowered and therefore uninteresting
That just casts them as tragic heroes who did what their gods bid, and doesn't acknowledge all the benefits they get literally just for being elves
Not necessarily
exactly
They're boring because their gifts are a given
That's literally everything I just described though
Yeah, world-threatening threats like rogue gods
I think Parsas quote is actually more descriptive of elves, because elves never had to struggle for what they had, they were born with it and the only time they struggle is when they encounter something that can challenge their inherent power (which is almost always some kind of world-ending apocalypticesque thing)
Elves are many different things to many different people, but it's important to remember the one thing elves always are: better. Better than you, me, and even other elves. Especially other elves.
there's no beating around the bush on that point
Elves are gay

Its literally a western story written by Japanese people
Berserk is the least weebish manga
and Griffith becomes a demon god
When guts loses his arm
It was the demonic one
Caska's was hotter &gt;.&gt;
It was suitably dark for the setting
Yeah
so I'm cool with pretty much anything
I like Berserk
O O F
Theres a fine line to tread in terms of length
that's what I mean
I don't mind the majority of session, but I feel like more than 1 or 2 sessions makes it get boring a bit
By dungeon crawl do you mean long drawn out dungeon dive or just going into a dungeonesque setting in general
is there a third option?
Lul
You subhuman baboon. You literal nigger.

How dare you speak, you swarthy jungle monkey. How dare you open your big lipped, rim encrusted, menthol cigarette smelling mouth?

You are human trash, Diego Tyrone LeShawn de Maradona. Universally despised, derided and mocked. Your nationality and skin tone offers no hope to the world that South America can ever prosper. Crawl back in to the Brazilian jungle you came out of, you literal orangutan.

I hope you decide to sail your grandfathers skip to the Falklands and rape some sheep, as is in the negroes nature. It would still be the whitest pussy you ever had. Give Nigel and Robert a chance for some target practice, your sole use to the world. Argentinians obsession with a few windswept islands in the Atlantic is hilarious but sad. Coincidentally its the only worthwhile contribution Argentina has made to the medical field. The MUH LAS MALVINAS sentiment in the average negro Argentinian is both an early warning sign of autism in children, and early on set Alzheimer's in adults.

Take your black hairy fingers off your keyboard, and never talk about the human species again, you mockery of our supposed shared ancestor.. No amount of olive oil and wheat flour slabbed on your face every morning will make you white. It's about as delusional of an idea as your daydreams of European heritage.

You nigger.

You make Bolivia look like a beacon of civilisation.

You are the Baltimore of South America.

Go fertilise the pampas with you and your families corpses, its the best you can hope for in life. For the first time in your life, nigger, you have a job making food for beings vastly superior to yourself. Uruguayan cattle. Coincidentally, it would be the first time an Argentinian "man" provided for a family.

Die, Diego. No one would miss you. Except for Australian Aboriginals, who now would have no one to make them look good.
