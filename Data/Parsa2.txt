something joshathan sent me&gt; In my oncogenesis class we're learning about cancer and its development. I'm currently watching an interview with a Nobel prize-winning cancer researcher and he said that while many factors can cause cancer--the environment and viruses, to name a few--the most potent cause of cancer known today is this post

Now listen here Jack. I've been in and out of the real deal White House with my good friend, Brock. You don't think I don't know the difference between a fake and... you know... whole White House? Take a knee skippy and let a tried and true man say some words... Like good words and... So there was this time back in '69 when me and my best pal Barraka, we were out in the White House lawn when a tangerine man came running in and starting ruining the whole show. And I said to him... I said... I said now listen here ugly! You better cut that attitude or we're going to have to take this out behind the bleachers. And then he was... he ran off... And America... I'm prepared to do it again. Thank you.

I live in the White House on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on the 1st floor. My name is Joseph Biden. I’m 77 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my arms look s a little skinny, I’ll put on  1940s music while doing my pushups, Jack. I can do a thousand now. After I turn off the music I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I remind people who Obama is. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then a pro-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Joseph Biden. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense I used to be intelligent, I simply am not mentally there.

and my purpose.

is not
saitama
to name 3 quickly
bang's apprentice
meteor knight
handsome mask
i liked the season finale but it doesnt really do anything to address current developing plotlines
the anime had a solid ending?
thats like saying they shouldnt put ice in water because its a different state of organization blah blah blah
because it exists in another medium i shouldnt enjoy it the way i would like?
why
despite the fact that the anime hasnt explored several plot points that are in the manga? and even less than that in the web comic?
there are a lot
and one punch
fist of the north star is also great
and i dont care if thats from a different anime
You are already reported.
Skypo! Report this fool!
Guess youre really gonna make me break out my STANDO
Oh? You're doubling down on talking shit about Jojo instead of backpeddling and begging for forgiveness?
:/
diego how far out from home are you?
i need a break from final study
im down to play
im not sure its for me
no
umm
ok so i looked it up
i dont know what that is
free account
umm
when we each got a crunchyroll account/
bichael are you back from class or still rising and grinding for that bread
as far as dnd garbage goes
i still have that dungeon ready that nobody in this group except mars played
also are we videogays?
if i could add something to my vote it would be: Faggot and I totally support you
Haha, of course not
BROUDER ME MUST
BROUDER
but
but
muh nigma are we still league?
thank you slacks for making content i support
that new deckpasito is looking pretty good
what fucking opium den was he sleeping in when he wrote that fucking power
especially when he came up with bites the dust 
i will just assume araki was sleep deprived when writing part 4
at least its not retarded like fucking dragonball
every show has its problems with consistency
don't pay too much attention to plot consistency. because araki forgets sometimes 
CRACKA VOLLEY
Jojo. a show about Englishmen. but when that wasn't selling they made it about JAPANTOWN THANK YOU NIPPON
KONO DIO DA
3 and 4
i just also like complaining about everything
and i do like part 3
everyone has an opinion milo
its the ripoff of Indiana jones
also being into mommies
or some shit
kakyoin, whose contributions was exclaiming how no one can dodge the emerald splash and being good at videogames
yeah
i mean
that would be assault
right down to the fucking whip
right down to the fucking whip
my favorite jojos are not the highschoolers mind you
that's a very important part of the show
and 17 year old high schoolers who are built like Olympian athletes
back when hamon was a thing and when people in stupid looking clothes weren't screaming about ENEMY STANDOS
what part miles? I think youre starting with phantom blood right?
Oh? youre approaching him? Instead of running away?
I did get the lowest tho
that is actually not true as multiple others got sub 30
also eric don't fucking accuse people of shit you yourself are guilty of. just because youre the only one who fervently denies his rampant autism doenst mean youre actually right
ive been watching a ton of southpark recently and now everytime I type eric I just see cartman
didn't call japan developing eric
because that's retarded
I don't think the cultural standards of developing nations should be what youre trying to emulate
japan truly has a national resource. grown women who sound like children. thanks sseth
wow that's terrible
fuck it
skype makes gifs fucking impossible
girls don't exist
not so youre not perving on an underaged 2d grill
is that the reason?
welcome to nippon. get your shit together
learn to parry idiots
fromsoft is tired of you retards dodge rolling out of everything
game is hard
I beat the wolf but the fuckin corvian knight still kills me
so I fucked off and beat the abysswatchers in one try
the corvian knight or the bigass wolf keep fucking killing me
im stuck on my current playthrough
youre like the ricardo of this groupchat
michael
because I never did
and I was sad
then he got gud
back then he sucked as much as I did
I met Michael in 6th grade violin class
45ish
his winrate is pretty low rn
also drow ranger pog
oh god im not ready for another bristleback like passive
so i can actually run the damn thing
i fixed my graphics card problem
put up or shut up boi
game is ahrd
played 4 games and got shit on on all 4 of them
i reinstalled apex legends
Ricardo Milos is fuckin GREAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
like... a real oldie
this is an oldie
HERE COMES THE MONEY
fuckin when
I love having my shit stolen
It didn’t really show us much of anything. But hey if my boy reynauld is back I’m game
No
Eww
Forgot the damn things name
The only starter whose look I liked was the emperor penguin 
no
umm
the starters look ugly as all hell
idk
it looked... more of the same
I saw the sword and shield announcement and
so theres that
well... you cant Naruto run hash into cities tho
kenshi looks like wonky mount and blade imo
That’ll make one B I G BORGAR
Dio best husbando
where is my golden-haired princess
gio isn't on the list
THANK YOU RICARDO
what is your stando powah?
game is hard
Dankest Dungeon 2: Eldritch Boogaloo
The comments section was spicy 
Might be cool the first game was fun
For the like maybe 2 other people in this chat that played the darkest dungeon, red hook studios announced they are making another one
and i have no fucking clue what i should do
so it didn't help with my framerate problems
im not really planning on playing
im just seeing if reinstalling windows fixed my lag problem
im already in a game
i don't remember doing that
why would I tell you about a hero's voiceline?
the joke is the hero has a voice line: "Wolves need no armor"
I watched the video days ago
guess wolves do need armor
Sick agi gain too
ofc hes fucking broke
he lives in LA and isn't some big ticket streamer
jesus fuck has anyone else been dealing with fucking disgusting framerate issues since a windows update?
who's that handsome devil?
LAKAT MATATAAAAAAAAAAG
absolutely horrendous
mars and I had the most miserable experience trying to play apex legends together
and that was that
i just tried to shoot people then an ulting bloodhunter ran around the corner at light speed
but i didnt fucking use any of that
i get that the draw is that characters have abilities and shit
yeah
i got second place
ill play one game before i fuck off
i installed it to give it a try
well im glad it means that much to you
nothing beats the blink slammer
they patched this cancer
I heard about that
Muh realism
hes still on the Minecraft hunger games grind
wise words from midormeepo
5hours for small patches, 3minutes to get into a relationship, Purge has his priorities right﻿
thanks purge
that's great
what the fuck am I supposed to see?
they are working on it
Mars you are being exceptionally stupid
How about this
Maybe by not being direct I’m short circuiting his brain
Isn’t an opinion by definition a not completely factual statement
There is a pattern to speech mars
Is mars attempting insightful discourse by dribbling on his monitor and randomly slapping keys on his keyboard?
I’m more thinking about triple a titles like metro 
I think it’s fine
Twitch literally prints money for them
just... don't fucking make a games platform its not that easy
gj epic games you know how to support one game
BR games print money for like 3 months before they are eclipsed... unless they constantly update their game
so
apex legends got no marketing, got like 1000000 players their first day
titanfall had no marketing and died
think of it like this
did you play it mars?
it is free btw
and hes great so sure ill listen to him
is a tweet from STAR_
Apex Legends is a good example of not giving people the time to complain about video games before they release.
I think
apex is titanfall for people who actually want to play a game that's not like 3 years dead
its dumb
people just keep leaving the que
whomst?
:/
does it have great postgame?
fucking trolls
bring back iron talon and skeleton king
rip ring of aquila
I have to patch tho
same
same
As this is the corporate edition of fighting gold how do we plan on expanding our brand?
Oh No He Was R U S S I A N
What the fuck was that ss building
I don’t want to steal your thunder 
I support you Michael
I’d have to get past the second episode of the season first
This is gay
Um excuse me
Um excuse me
Go back to philosophical discourse about feminine dicks please
What
Me big brain now
Thank you bensl very educational 
after i take this shit i will be
my toilet and i are no longer on speaking terms
me currently having my stomach pumped for eating pizza while lactose intolerant
I cant play dopa
im still knight 8
also that's gay
once is enough
mech picker
lol
YOU CANT HAVE MY SHEKELS
but that alone sounds gay
but then again I cant remember 5 minutes ago so I doubt anything would jog my memory
not really narrowing it down
umm
whomst?
some bullshit about the epic games platform
I heard about that
yeah
i don't think so
I watched 5 seconds and was confused by their terminology enough to make me want to shoot myself
how vile
I think its going on the epic games platform
metro exodus is not coming to steam right?
emitter. hisoka said they are quick to lose their shit for small inconveniences.
what the fuck is the button
I never really looked at jotoros hat
not the fucking character who is 2 gay men in a weapon possessed body who keep the demon weapon from committing genocide with the power of their love?
that's the lore that puts you over the edge?

its not enough to have a 1 champion pick puddle. you need a 1 champion ban puddle too
just ban him every game lol

I’m glad to have facilitated this meeting so you all can adequately plan out your Wednesday jamboree.
In front of the theater
I’m there
im with it
should I eat before or after
im taking b12
and you deserve a trophy
because spamming skype auto responses is the peak of comedy
and we wont come to a consensus in time
but I feel like this was too sudden
then plan around that
we just have to pick a time and get some tickets
I don't think it matters
should we?
umm
have we worked out a time for tuseday to see the movie?
im good for it
have we got a time?
i prefer tuseday
have we decided on a day?
ive got something im going to at 6:30 in hawthorne
and only early wednesday
im good for tuseday
I am
but I think its a ways away for milo
its not too far for me
after Wednesday the theater in westwood is showing all the way til sunday
google search shows showtimes up till this sunday
in the westwood village
a place called iPic on Wilshire blvd
Thursday a theatre is westwood is playing it
not any nearby
do yall want to try to organize it for tuseday or Wednesday? or let it pass it up
the thing is its only showing for the next two days
mhmmm
so its pretty early to be thinking about it
i mean my birthday is the 2nd
so whats the play?
yall like aquaman right?
aquaman is showing in amc 7 after
i mean...
i donno
but I think amc 7 is going to have its last showing of it this wednesday
idk when showtimes are
and that was one that I was interested in too
I haven't either
do you have a movie in mind?
are yall interested in something like that?
fucking emoji
eww
like some big group date
just go to third street for dinner and a movie
its my birthday soon and I want to know if yall are interested in doing the same thing we did last year
also ankles
...
You already know
What is it?
What do you know?

You tell me
She thought Lisa Lisa is a bitch and that kars was a big pussy boy
So I just spent like 5 hours watching the entirety of battle tendency with my sister

Hooray!

fffffffffffffffucking supports thinking they can carry safelane
Cancer
thank you SirActionSlacks! very cool
I will also be coming home friday
and no she doesn't lose everything at the end of DwD
you mean... storytelling?
…. a character experiencing conflict along her path to achieving her goals?
so youre up to date. what is a plot that you feel has been resolved poorly
where are you in the song of ice and fire rn?
I've fallen into the trap that ive been telling other people to avoid. Attempting to reason with a piece of paper with only one thing written on it is useless. 
how does the fact that the series is unconcluded as of rn mar the content currently out there?
instead you gave me... a vampire novel set in the US?
you haven't given me an unclosed plotline in GOT yet
having an ending without ongoing conflict is bad
a conclusion to the series only has to wrap up the main plot not every subplot in the story
i doubt that tbh. he has to write 2 more books
and i know nothing about it
that's not GOT.
what unwrapped plotline are you referring to right now?
numbers?
….
i don't see GOT as a rip
and I read part of the romance of the 3 kingdoms. 
fucking starcraft was supposed to be a licensed 40k game
most of blizzard games' settings are rips from GW properties
who got his material from folklore
most fantasy settings are rips from Tolkien
like... every story ever?
because it has source material?
rn youre trying to tell me that the story sucks because you don't like it
if you want to make a point you don't begin by calling the other a retard.
and not an issue with the writing or story telling
which sounds like a personal problem
being the oldest child of ned stark. oh hey another lawful good protagonist
she is valued as a commodity not as a person
and I hate it
arya has plot armor
that I agree with
and having story arcs depicting different characters with different motivations is... how a story is written
not a mary sue
she is married to one of the most amoral characters in the show and is later raped by THE most amoral character in the show
she doesn't have everything given to her nor does she have obscene natural gifts
shes not a mary sue
oh you mean jon fucking snow
not having a lawful good protagonist?
O K
and he doesn't like the author's work ethic
if I remember correctly eric doesn't like the series because... it has source material...
well after season 4 the writers of the show just... kinda winged it
euron was a thing
its releasing its final season this summer
soon tm
got ends next season
when brann deadpan narrated
6
and it culminated to that fucking pointless ending
the entire season was like.... a season where actions have no consequences
I don't agree with you mars
season 7 was dumb
what about it?
uhh
fuckin 2000 games on kunkles
sorry I cant play kunkka like fucking !attacker
… id rather have internet
id rather have internet
I wouldn't trade 70s for now
fuckin queer
I thought it looked more like borderlands than anything else
you give onto me depression
how dreadful michael
no
umm
but not for the next hour
maybe later today
also still no
but not what the fuck we do with the stuff
i mean they always say we gotta get the bread
YEAH
uhh
im going to go hang myself in my closet for making that joke
i didn't even have to rise and grind for it
i got this bread
i mean
what the fuck am I going to do with them
I now have about... 3 loaves of baked bread in my apartment now
so no
for some reason.
baking
parents are in my dorm
cease
fuckin
which kinda sucks
also theres a BR game mode
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh we're swamped with hackers now
fuck
because that's a thing apparently
none of that hydrogen shit either
and dont fucking tell me youre driving a tesla get the fuck out
and stay there
put your mouth around your car's exaust
exit this building
ah yes... the most heroic quality of giving someone a cleft lip for one comment about his hair
or he will literally disfigure you for life
dont mess up his hair
don't mind me ill just be cleaning up this heresy
ahhhhhh well...
I thought it was called crazy diamond
literally no jojo has both mom and dad
why the fuck every jojo only have one parent
and josuke is like a 15 year old brat
Joline sucks
also there is one female jojo
supposed to be male characters
those are
last guess
nope
nope
ill let you guess which one
2 out of 3 of those should be deleted
2 out of 3 of those should be deleted
but still
ik bowsette is like... dead and gone
also Michael fox girls are like fucking bottom tier
gotta add that edit for proper grammar
even I, the most superior being, cannot hope to match their cruelty
even I, the most superior being, cannot hope to match their cruelty
like peta
that brings about more problems...
it is the most chad
you are wrong michael
such a thing cannot be allowed to happen as I and  I alone can be the most perfect human
as the spawn would surely attempt to rival my greatness
would never allow myself to reproduce
as the perfect human
i
no
so
if anything kira has the highest record of exterminated thots in the entire fucking series
that's making an assumption im not comfortable with
how
fucking
also kira is great fuck those jojo douches
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh dio did nothing wrong
you go to hell and you die
you go to hell
awful
fucking
Joesph has both character and an abundance of heroic qualities
The pillar men were weird so we’re ignoring them
But honestly fuck those guys DIO and KIRA for life
Therefore he isn’t a joestar
To be a joestar you have to either have no character or a minimal amount of heroic traits
I have a different path to get to the same conclusion
How does color affect ones perception on whether a fight is boring or not
watching dota is fucking great
watching dota tho
actually boring
watching overwatch tho
playing overwatch is.... ehhh
kira is fucking great
except kira
also part 4 big gay
who uses his powers to permanently mar peoples faces when they make fun of his hair
YOUR MOM GAY
fuck your pompadour lookin ass hair
and fuck his dumbass hair
josuke
fuck
that exist
things
the rest are
ok the third one is an actual fucking hat
what the FUCK
where does the fucking hair start and hat end?
Also Varus is actually two gay guys who hold back the murderous impulses of a sentient weapon with their love
Kill maim burn and all that good stuff
tasteful
but hey its just a link for now
and here's me thinking sharing that video with you wont result in a deluge of porn in the skype chat
I hate this
can I help you sir?
I didnt
well
AMAZING
my mom just called me and said someone used her apple id to buy 99 dollars worth of fortnite vbucks

How heretical

hey everyone edgelord here. don't mind my edge
and I dislike it
its mistaking ignorance for innocence
nature being more pure and civilization/institution being corrupting and all that
that's the whole premise behind noble savage
I thought they were cringy
Jungle hippies w/ animal parts
Vastayans are just riots attempt at portraying the noble savage archetype 
Schlept
Game balance is harder
Game is hard
I’m thinking ugh it’s this fucker again taking my damn camps
Like when I see ivern I’m not thinking OH BOY a nonstandard jungler
Or she’ll be a stupid gimmick like ivern 
I think she might bring some spice in a game
Fuck that
The only way I see it is if she turns into a tank and the assassin looking at her is like
Idk I feel like that’s just gonna be a stupid gimmick 
Oh and a second healthbar

Real question
Eric confused at 2D wemen 
I have an intimate relationship with my right hand eric
Before me then I thought I’d lose first
To even refer to yourself as Godd is... HERESY

Thanks todd

miles you were excited for diablo immortal right?
Imagine coming up with a moral theory that has people acting justly simply for the sake of being just rather than fearing the social or economic consequences of acting unjustly.
invalid
I noticed that
strokes of brilliance like this make me wonder how you haven't suffocated yourself with a plastic bag
impressive logic eric
well im sure waiting 40 min to be kicked repeatedly is a more enjoyable experience
sounds like I picked the right game to not be in
imagine not playing for 60 minutes everygame
ikr
When teammates from your last game tilt you and you take out your frustration on your teammates in your next game
Ah yes
Did you enjoy the magic video?
A mere recommendation is all
I’m late to this conversation as I’ve been driving for the last 3 hours
If you’re shitposting about the pillarmen theme look at the we are number one/pillarmen theme mashup
6-8 a day will give me huge cancer

unless one is much shorter than the other
and tbh being a part of 2 campaigns is really not gonna work out w/ my schedule
2 hour games so nobody loses their fucking minds
fucking maddening
it went for like 5 hours
i felt like the session got more crazy the longer it went on
the screenshots look funny tho
the game that's been in early access for like 10 years
overgrowth?
wildstar is dead btw
No I’m not home yet
I’ve been in the car for the last 3 hours

steam just gave me a coupon for dos2 since I own the damn game
mai fren are you are you autisitic?
well Michael I guess you know how to conduct yourself around the fairer sex than i
but. wemen on the other thing
I have to say ive never had to deal with the race thing yet
also youre reading a book damn you. why are you getting hung up on how power armor looks
they can also relive the memories of people or things if they fucking EAT THEIR FLESH
what the fuck
they have 2 hearts mars
but youre stuck on the power armor?
and have several fantasy organs giving them crazy powers n shit
space marines are 8 ft tall
the point is im hoping if you start reading 30k because of this you will actually just do it on your own
youre only reading horus rising
oh right you have to support the fucking money racket called black library
what was your penalty again?
mmmmmmmmmmmeh
I don't actually know what youre referring to when you said train shit
I actually don't see your answer mars
you lost?
mars never answered my question
Bru-jeh?
how do you say that phonetically?
mars did you lose yet?
so its solely a competition between myself and the individual I challenged?
am I still subject to the penalty we agreed on?
and I fail later on into the month
if the individual I challenged fails
I have a clarifying question about no nut november
are we all still in the game?
uhhh fellas
thank you skype
I sent that message 2 days ago I think
Did I post self dead prevention here?
Such is the punishment
Drag them to the front of the classroom and club then to death
Michael you should have taken action against the swine
Amazing
Is an auto response from Skype 
Kappa
Then no one knows of the trials and tribulations of unka unk 
are we in the same continent?
Also dio is the only daddy for me
Only speedwagon can pull off something like that
Somehow he went from useless to crippled and useless?
Now we just use spooky ghosts to punch the bad guys
Remember when fucking hamon breathing was a thing?
Speedwagon wouldn’t choke slam shit he’d just stand at the side and excitedly commentate on Jonathan choke slamming something with is special breathing magic
soon all your anime protagonists will succumb to the temptations of Mcdonalds
America wins again nippon
fuck magic chi or whatever the hell they use we have gunpowder, industrialization, and a ban on labor unions
whens the part in the series where imperialist America crashes a fucking man-o-war into japantown and modernizes them
even with magic eyes and bullshit like that
pfffffffffffffft
as the main protagonist is suspiciously Caucasian looking in a place brimming with Japanese people
good. at least Mengele's work is alive and well in fantasy nippon
are special eyes and eugenics still the main focus of this animu?
que?
should I start?
no
one of these things just doesn't belong
one of these things is not like the others
GET DAH MACHETES

gay fish
gaemsux
game is unplayable
I want to fucking kill myself
what the fuck do you mean they got rid of trophy stands
fucking what
man I only played that to collect all the boss trophies
is that as much of a shitshow as the first one
what about subspace emissary 2.0
only gaylords would try and deny eying simon belmont
fucking queer
who wasnt
basically inting is that you?
basically inting?
which apparently doesn't lose you any audience members in this chat
that's raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacist
mars are you still in the game?
I haven't nutted and am still going strong
No point denying it
The science is there guys
That means women are twice as gay
That’s twice as many as men have
Women have 2 X chromosomes
amazing
 SOOKA BLYAT

I donno guys remastered uther lightbringer might make me break no nut novemeber
and it looks fucking great
but they remastered Warcraft 3
well they didn't make a new warcraft
that's his punishment btw, if he loses he has to read horus rising
yikes
or else he has to read black library
…. with the help of cocoa butter
then you reject his challenge
you were challenged eric
Stop squinting 
Here’s an idea
Will you hold that to the other two or is your selective blindness preventing that
Your insecurity is showing when you flail insults around like a headless chicken
I think the worst part is that you have to get placed
Oh shiiiiiiit
And should you fail?
Well fuck me then since mars refused me
You are weeeeeeeak
Weak
Don’t you think the punishment of failure should be unique to each challenge?
I feel like the result of failure is geared towards your own desires
I challenge you to resist your mind numbing impulse to crank your shaft in public or otherwise, lest you cower before my unerring will this november
I challenge you to resist your mind numbing impulse to crank your shaft in public or otherwise, lest you cower before my unerring will this november
In other words I think I’ll win and I like winning
Mars you fucking manwhore
There are no winners in YOUR game
I don’t think I can beat david
Or mars right
Except David 
Then I don’t reckon I’ve got someone to challenge 
Can I challenge someone whose already been challenged or has already challenged someone?
Ok
Ummm
Then my next whinging is about how that should be a comma instead of a period
Isn’t that what you’re trying not to do?
It says you shall bust your nut
Milo read the first sentence of your oath
Mars I don’t think it’s the costume thats scaring the kids
not if I send you there first
you cannot send me to crybabby jail
its pretty alright. and that's as close as ill get to giving resounding endorsement
but really though I do like the Arcanum ost. sseth said it wasn't that good but I gave it a try anyways
I cry myself to sleep listening to sadboi music
they don't appreciate joji
because they don't listen to joji
these troglodytes wouldn't know good music if it attacked them with a pocket knife in a dark alley.
I don't spam the music I listen to because I know everyone would immediately think its garbage. evidently mars you haven't come to that realization yet.
Dindo nuffin?
Press X to doubt
i don't even know what game geno is from
idk man I thought his rambling was funny
id feel like theres a little bias there
also im pretty sure those playtesters are people who already like smashbros
my understanding of smash bros
bold claim for a game that hasn't even fucking come out yet
also get fucked lb players your laning phase IS RUINED
I always thought they would look like idiots talking to themselves 
I’ve always wondered how people look like when they’re doing those IRL streams
All You Had To Do Was Follow The Damn Train CJ
Fellas, whenever you hear someone next to you speak a different language do you think he’s just talking shit about you and doesn’t want you to know it?
if a man does it, he is considered... Genghis Khan

duh
mars
Miles the Covetous Demon?
just improbable
its possible
hes not wrong
AMAZING
then he leaves
then gives us a weird look
he shows up turns on facecam
also brock is always squinting at me. the fuck did I do brock!
I love a man with his own entrance song and dance routine
Didn’t you do that to play god of war 4?
Console lol
Why the fuck would rockstar just alienate a large portion of a market
I mean gta5 did right?
I think it’ll come to pc eventually
Fair
No Jaaan maaarshtan
Y’all excited for the newest brokeback mountain game?
are players fucking bullet sponges?

People will still buy them
Morality is a spook
B A N N E D
I wouldn't want a bike
Not in ranked mode there isnt
It’s in beta right?
mine is broken
how did you get the game to work for you?
I was upset at “anti-couth”

How many franchises can you embed your backstory into?
If you use a hydraulic press to flatten your penis, it would become 2-D, thereby allowing you to partake in your debauchery
Not so michael
In the grim dankness of the far future there is only shitposts 
I already have the opening line for you milo
lol
literally his one physical trait that i remember clearly was 12" flacid
Michael do you think youre a better roleplaying faggot than you were back when you wanted to play a three legged man?
i mean i totally think i have
i feel like some of us got better at being good roleplaying faggots
now we have expectations
you really shouldn't have said it dude
CAMPAIGN WHEN
sure lets start berating him now
omegalul
would it be a dnd setting? including all the races n shit?
i just like rolling dice and berating friends while doing silly accents
i mean... if you want do dm it Michael ill be down to be unkindled ash
you don't want your players feeling like they are just strapped into the ride and have no control over where they are going
in all things, a story has to be flexible enough to allow for players to feel impact
new dnd campaign. the trials and tribulations of cuckton citizens as aggressing Japanese nationalists invade their lands to take their citrus
the citrus is MINE
eat shit and die
i remember cuckton
"like-wisdom and shit scoobs. we gotta get that wisdom."
milo you played shaggy
i mean im still a horrible person but i had to pretend that i wasn't for a little while
im a terrible person. then I played team mom
whenever I think of a story I immediately default to BASHING CHAOS
im remarkably terrible at worldbuilding
single-minded characters are easier to play, and maybe more enjoyable.
I think multifaceted characters don't work in dnd. because its too hard to focus on so many sides
id be sad
in my mind, making a character is like a build-a-bear. I want a polarbear with a cute parka but if someone says you can have a polarbear in a Hawaiian shirt or a black bear in a parka
not have someone thrust theirs upon them
people like to design their own baby
Im on campus and the earliest I’ll be home by is 10pm
Fucking put out Arcturus 
Why the fuck are they making more Warcraft heroes
You have gifted onto me a most magnificent depression 
Can either of them makea da good spaghett?
I just want spaghett 
After the fights the gladiators would enjoy spaghett w/ fake blood
It was all wooden swords and tomato paste
Back in Rome, gladiators didn’t actually kill eachother
What does that mean?
you could just not play ranked
VERY SNEAKY
"I Understand"
I beat you to it jett
Nigga moment?
Based on your deranged ramblings from yesterday I’d say we already have a lot to draw conjecture from
such loud professions of autism have never been heard as they have now.
ik mars is preoccupied
are we videogames tonight?
I may be?
fucking seriously?
CYKA
what does skype have to say about that?
CYKA BLYAT
also the phone version is broken
it asked me a bunch of questions
... he’s not responding. I guess he already started
Next question is will you get legally shitfaced?
Can mars get legally shitfaced?
To possess such potent autism... you must be a marvel to behold.
Any time that’s not Murican time isn’t worth my time at all
It’s fucking 10 am

He's got a long shirt
I haven't played the game if youre referring to me
which doesn't speak to my preferences
i should point out that they are only recommended as "popular among friends"
I still violently hate how milf and hentai are games being "recommended" to me
"Fancier the food, the closer it is to eating a human. That's all rich people want to do."
I’m probably going to be a few minutes late
I called him stupid and he didn't respond. I guess that means he agrees
Lol
Anyone want to go get dinner tonight?
Axe is axe.
Because you two played that hentai game, steam recommended it as “trending among friends”
Fortnite?
one of these things is not like the other. one of these things just doesn't belong.
I saw the gameplay trailer and didn't see anything about that
Autism

Ok
At least it’s not another fucking Warcraft hero
Before Arcturus fucking why 
i don't know what you sent but im assuming you accidentally activated your niBBer macro again
umm sorry guys turns out we don't know what the fuck we're doing. enjoy more assassin buffs. time to kill has been reduced to 0.3 seconds for every character in the game.

Yesterday I went biking with my dad for 5 hours
for the three  people who regularly play
but it was the most self contained game in the series
ik technically all those queens are shards of manus, who you killed in the first game and the world is still in the throws of gwyn setting himself on fire and demanding other dipshits to do the same (dark lord for life)
ds2 plot was, by far, the most isolated from what happens in the other games
that's mostly a ds3 thing
AND FUCKING HELL EVERYONE AND THEIR FUCKING MOTHERS WERE EXPECTING MENGSK
but FUCKING GOD DAMN IT ANOTHER WARCRAFT HERO
I mean the kit is cool

youre actually right just replace 8ft tall fungus people with humans
gorkamorka?
I don't care

and la'thaal seems bullshit
i don't like ooze
I like it

which sounds pretty good
youre more likely to get a bloodborne 2
which wont happen fromsoft said they were done
imo
it was the worst
WE WERE DONE MARS
davai cyka
ok it only works with *
-does this work?-
i didn't know this is a thing
waiting to be berated
and miles is one to talk about using appropriate tone in conversation
i just normally brandish my sharpened pitchfork when engaged in friendly banter
it never was
most people agree that its just ds1 with a hd patch
and looking at that spicy review score
it is 40
im checking rn
making it cost 60 bucks and getting it to be a better port is what they did in remastered
because blighttown is ass
except blighttown
and as far as ds1 vs ds3 goes, i like the maps and bosses better
its an old port that inst carrying a 40 dollar pricetag. spending 5 minutes to get the same experience as shelling out another 20 bucks is value
and try again
clean install it without that mod
agree to disagree
what do you mean burden
i went on nexus and downloaded 2 mods in five minutes miles i didn't carry the fucking one ring to mount doom
imo
and that free easy way does make the game better
you should do it
if there is a free, easy way to get a better experience out of a game
Michael if your car has a bad paint job is the car bad because you need to get it repainted?
where the pvp netcode was a fucking spaghetti nightmare?
backstab city?
are we going back to its original release?
if you enhance a product, then the product is better.
intended experience doesn't mean best experience
because todd howard is a dink?
i don't think youre in the majority
I think being on pc means you probably use mods with games
uninstall your entire mod folder for fallout newvegas
that doesn't make sense to me
that means mods
you said this is on pc
so that's a plus for remastered
BUT I will say that ds remastered actually has a large enough playerbase that running around with humanity will probably get you invaded in some places
im running an hd patch and a mod called Dsync. which makes the controls less retarded
and youre on pc. mods are accessible and easy to use.
if you hop on nexus and get some mods, its basically remastered without the pricetag
fight me
why are you still here then?
from Uniqlo or urban outfitters
vintage clothing?
you will know what im talking about
kill those fucking cup of stress skellingtons
just remember
darkest dungeon is pretty tough on the rng
I leik skellingtons
heres a better one but milo and mars already saw it
ok there you go
its supposed to play by itself

regi
remy?
lets go back to regi calling eric an asshat
yall can rip on dota but if you don't play the game enough to actually be semi competent at it your criticisms are pretty pointless
that's a late game thing that has a minute fucking cooldown
that's pretty mechanical
can you disjoint spells with items or abilities in league?
wut
there is no skill in dota. and the game has a high skill barrier to entry?
later is more than 2 min and that can cripple a team
which is almost always more than 10 percent
you get 175 X 5 gold
you... get more than that
so its not like having to run to baron or dragon to buy an item
which lets you sit in lane and use cour to get secret shop items without losing pressure
you have a cour
heres the thing with secret shop
care
dont
i
but
antimage is magina

@Horoscope Capricorn
fuck you queer
blehhhhhhh team?
i meannnnnnnn
i mean still hold off until he confirms it
since he had to think of the tourney events and all that
I mean that kev said it was likely that we weren't playing this week
we might not be in that game since the dm said he was worried about how to run it
yes
and then you can just win encounters by yourself
just be a deadweight to your team for the first dozen levels
thats also why i call it the antimage build
we're playing for lategame
its a scaling build
at least mars isn't playing gaylock
well
and still do fighter lvls of damage
stack ac and saving throw shit
dump intelligence, acquire spells that don't scale with int and are just useful by themselves
dex fighter eldritch knight
can I interest you in my "unkillable" build?
isn't that just fighter with extra steps?
you might want to try fighter/rogue multiclass
I think in early levels to secure the bag
it is but what sounds cooler
precognition or prescience? 
real shit guys
precognition
helped us win in the end
gj eating that lightning bolt mars
even though we usually win
encounter exp is fine so long as you track it but if people are just trying to last hit over eachother you get something similar to what mars and i have in a different game
i dont think making it a competition for last hits is a good idea
lol

also it has a very interesting anti cheat engine that requires you to restart your computer when you install it so it can start running immediately after turning on your computer

oh shit im sorry

Well
I think he blocked me
Whatever. I did what I did. Maybe I fix it
I fucking accuse everyone else of being too pissy when I’m probably the most
I’m gonna go apologize

Fuck
Probably shouldn’t have said that

you do like picking at scabs don't you?
that lagged my computer
red vs blue huh?
im going with mentor
fresh start vs established groundwork
I on the other hand don't rightly care if we do or don't. benefits to both imo
you could have hit the senna
ill dig it up again. YOU WERE IN AUTOATTACK RANGE
do you want to dig it up again?
ive heard this already
so I wont
you told me not to
or am I just tacked on for eric to berate
begs the question am I even a player
[1574056411] Eric Huang: parsa fuck your vote you toxic cuck

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
how dreary
i apparently don't get a vote. 
rn its just been me and you
the hero's journey is tried and true. i kinda want to hear other peoples opinions
then develop into 2
but honestly i still think start with one
im not wrong in saying its important to contrast action with placidity first. it is important because it makes that action matter more
cant see why not
i mean.... star wars had it all in the first 30 minutes of the film
and that hits harder than opening up with crispy bones
theeeeeen the empire turned them into crispy bones
and it was nice
you got to see that farm
luke skywalker's aunt and uncle had a nice moisture farm
wouldn't that mute that action packed opening if you have nothing to contrast it with?
and it didn't sit well
starting in the shit is kinda how this first game went
i think there should be at least some time period where things are going fine before things aren't
i honestly don't feel that
and not at least have 1 or 2 sessions with all is well and things are normal building up to why is everything on fire?
GOOD LUCK
so you just want to start the game with: that place you've spent time at was burned down and youre on your own
i don't entirely agree
is a railroaded main story a bad thing as long as theres some sidequests to distract us with along the way?
thats a legitimate plotline we cant have that
like a heroes journey
wait that's too structured and makes too much sense
then it becomes 2
maybe something goes wrong and we have to leave adventuring school
to start with at least
still want 1 tbh
and terrible gene afflictions
heir to my crippling debt
i thought i was the autistic one who takes things literally
don't take everything i say so seriously sir
and that's actually a good thing
and my wife is cheating on me with my sister

i want to be in an average game of CK2
you said 1 of 2 options
then why bring it up nigga
did it
your area made me want to die from a malignant tumor
you deserve it
i want to go to adventuring school
1
1
1
1
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhbooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooy
what
umm
when the character runs out of medication then we begin the character arc of him vibe checking a talk show host
have you thought about building a wall?
in the grim darkness of the far future there is only teletubbies
who knows
I don't want to be the only one who comes in with his gritty, grimdark character
so again is this a serious game?
its not pronounced like zoomer boomoure
are they pronounced differently?
why does his first name end in er and his last in ur
and he does scream HIYAHHHHH everytime he does something
jett if you make zoomer the rock gnome youre going to play with Lonk, hero of highroole
but are we being serious in this game or do we just dick around
or whatever
or if it will be good
so honestly idk if this new game will even be a thing
and that I should stop talking to him about things and start talking to you
so eric said he doesn't want to think about this game for a few weeks
Fuck you you said reroll sub 7s
Fuck you you said reroll sub 7s
Pity?
feels weird man
i got gyped
but if we're commited to 3d6 ill reroll
I rolled the 4d6d1 already and got pretty good stats
im doing the magekiller eldritch knight
we scrapped that
so
you said you wanted magic
its BERRY important
im explaining to them the virtues of ancients and how they must be defended
now its next camping
league over
my negus is busy?
like I said
melee fighter.
piss off
fuck off with 30% lifesteal
then we wont
but if miles doesn't want to pull back
this would mean that we no longer have to manage the estate and deal with the headache that that brings
as well as changing party ideology
it would mean changing our party out to be people who worked under the old party
milo, mars, jett, and I want to do a scaling back of the party
so for miles to know all the stuff that we all talked about
wait no
no u
(disappointed)(loudlycrying)
I hate you too
something that i think was both attainable and beneficial
i did.
and was told to shut the fuck up
i did
its not us letting you mars its eric giving the hooks to you.
magic is ubiquitous everyone has a sending stone only when they need one
bullshit magic items are bullshit
shiiiiiiet
like classic dnd
you mean
no she wont power word stun
then when shes 15 shed be afraid to use her 8th
if this bitch was afraid to use her 9th lvl spell slot
because their power scales in a way that would matter
it means she doesn't have access to as absurd spells
i completely disagree
not exactly
and what does that mean?
let?
session 1 was most fun for me
I agreed with milo I just swapped them around
when that's where we spend all our time its fucking cancer
its fine if there is a homebase
so much
and ive grown to hate that
if the two ones that came late didn't immediately leave when  we killed the bigun
tbh we would have lost that fight
its silent image and burning hands
instead of retards throwing major images and fireballs like nothing
why I think it would be good is that it scales back the stuff that would be used by erics npcs
but we got pretty far
we didn't win
it was fun
I had a bunch of people try it with me
not by myself
you know I tried to kill that right?
but then again, im the crybaby who left and came back.
I think itd be good
its late and im going to sleep. if theres someone who isn't down with resetting and rescaling, that's fine
I am certain you are wrong
you say it shouldn't matter
straight up I cannot see anything but benefits by scaling down
her being 13 means she cant use as high level spells as a cudgel against players
it matters to me. that's why im asking everyone else
up
square
and mine will be the best
i can do that
you know what?
i call your bluff and raise you one retarded anime girl
i can make her work
i can play a better lucia than any of you numbnuts
oh?
not that I have any to give up
id give up my swag
if it means not having someone who can cast 9th lvl spells in the world, and the commonality of serious magic being culled
ik everyone wants to keep their fancy stuff they got but honestly
youre pushing it
im ok with restarting back at lvl 1 if it means most people in the game cant break out 5th lvl spells like theyre nothing
honestly
hed make it happen
so eric said that if everyone was cool with doing a reset and a scaleback on the power of the entire world
imo
that's fucking absurd
your average noble dude is a lvl 5-9 wizard
in the world as it is
so I will
so eric said I should bring this up
fantastic
and im already yelling at him
keep your ire focused on the person who deserves it
I think it is
I don't care sure 1 week
im gonna no life on skyrim then. i have a lot more freetime now that midterms are done
so we decided no game tonight
im ok with waiting a week for miles
id like to play b0fa but he didn't respond yet
no
you know he did this last week right?
I assumed yes
im not bugging the fucking dmc
im just going to voters and engaging in discourse, wheeling, and dealing
that implies that im pulling some watergate shit
that implies that im pulling some watergate shit
what?
rig?
no one is undecided
and these are all of them
and no im not looking through this chat to find something you can quickly repost
if they are unattainable
so then why is such a thing mentioned
Good luck
Does anyone in your petty?
Do you know how to detect magic?
Scout how? Your biggest concern is magic
Which is why I don’t think your plan of action of dimension door and hope for the best won’t work
Assuming someone who had a thief recently break in wouldn’t improve security in his home shortly after
I think it would
Yeah
But would it work
Immoral
Which idea is that?
and you throw it away because its not everything you wanted
you stand to gain something actually valuable
what youre asking for is unreasonable
its all your teenage angst boiling over a few years late?
so heres how you don't get chad
but earlier you said you didn't want chad
you don't even know either
that's what you get
of chad
instead
the dwarf
get
you
stop voting for third party candidates you fucking liberal
its fucking red or blue
and people get paid to do it
this is called lobbying
or by preforming a service for this councilmember
but that would require you to know this person, what he stands for, and why the dwarf is better for his platform than chad
attempt to sway their vote in the direction you would prefer though either simple pursuasion
for the people who are on the fence or not heavily leaning one way
so like i was saying
hello pot? this is kettle. youre black
just dont
dont
no sense in convincing Elliot not to vote for his brother
look at the people who are on the fence/ leaning chad but not fully commited
if you want the dwarf man to win
to begin with, identify who each councilmember is going to vote for
so shall i begin?
that's my thing
it never had legs to fall from to begin with
the best you can hope for right now is affecting who does get elected
it wont happen this time
to get elected?
you don't know me very well
to accomplish what
you wanted me to come up with a plan then?
now i don't have to use small words and sentences for his sake
that makes things easier
at?
that's a bad batting average
and it made sense zero times
i assumed all this time you had someone reading out the screen for you
you didn't read or you cant read?
it comes naturally?
do you purposefully forget this sort of thing or no
the lord prosecutor being one of the people that is part of the same conspiracy youre accusing riegan of?
wont get away with it?
a shapeshifter
so when does this dragon die again?
which he can do in human form
the dragon kills these guards
of 3 guards
with the assistance
a cr 15 monster
so then you kill the dragon
and this dragon will die when?
and will kill the 3 guards that were sent to detain an old man
at which point a dragon will be there
and he will be arrested as such
so you want to report the riegan name for conspiracy to commit murder
which.... is something you need him to be a green dragon to do?
I really dont
what
doing
by
and you intend to expose this dragon
then install a green dragon into that position
then kill joseph reigen
so you intend to kill miren reigan.
what the fuck is he waiting for right now?
for years
this man has held on to case files detailing a conspiracy to kill someone else
fuck off
hes waiting for your encouragement?
what?
and he doesn't because?
he has the evidence he needs to convict this guy
so hes the head of this system
alright
is he?
and that wont happen this time because?
why hasn't he already?
if he had enough evidence to convict them
with fake evidence?
no
and you want it to attack the city?
this thing refused to attack 700 soldiers?
what?
how do you kill the fucking dragon
not how you win
how
by killing a dragon
with the clout you receive
so you want to win
plagarist
don't you fucking use that against me
jetts character isn't even important enough to fucking be placed in the nobles gallery during the execution parade
nobody even knows any of your names
which is how bill Clinton won
your only purpose is to pull votes from one of the two people making the other guy win
in a 2 man race
youre like the third party candidate
it really wouldn't
by either doing a service to them
and attempt to dissuade them from doing so
select particular council members who would vote for chad
which you will fail
if youd like chad not to win, maybe instead of attempting to get a majority of votes
chad vs this dwarf guy?
is there someone that actually has a chance of winning that you would like to see not win?
im going to put forth this plan
and yet your plan was to invade someones home while hes asleep and knife him
but one more? that's craaaaaaaazy
no its fine if they get out
but not your other murder plots?
that's a start
you think?
if you want a position vacated vacate it
you two are the ones who are actively calling for rampant murder
are you actually asking me that?
for captain of the guard?
eric when is this vote taking place?
think
instead of fucking throwing spaghetti at a wall and seeing what sticks
so that you might stand a fucking ghost of a chance in the next election?
wouldn't it be smarter to start ingratiating yourself with people on this council?
if, in the future, there is a position available in this council
try to do something attainable
don't try to do something dumb
so yes
why would i ever shut the fuck up when im the only person with something worth saying?
these kind of people detest you
you are the definition of new money
you want to secure the votes of people who don't even know your name?
newborn babies have more profound things to say in between bouts of vomit and spittle
your incoherent rambling makes no sense
what should i take notes on?
NO
HAHAHA
hah
hah
you judging me?
feeling shame?
also youre wrong
die anyways
ok
oh so you said you know its not an election
its chosen by a bunch of boomers
its not an election
again
i didn't say that yet
if I was flaming like I do in dota I would tell you to die in a car accident 
youre black mars you have more leeway than I do
nsa that was a joke turn your gaze elsewhere thank you
just because it fucking happens doesn't mean oh well... better drop a nuke on yellowstone
making more disasters is not good
that's dumb
just because something could happen doesn't mean you should go and make it happen
most of me hopes you are wrong and you eat your fucking words
but that's a very small part of me
part of me hopes im wrong and youre right. it wont be a problem down the road
who the fuck knows
then it starts an ice age
now you give it the bead
then it starts drowning cows
it helped you with the river escape
ok lets think of this tit for tat
its just as much a leap as youre doing when you say its your asset
powerful asset dehhhhhhhhhhh
then it turns around and gives you rabies
yeah it might bite the person you want it to bite
you have as much control of that "asset" as you do a rabid dog
ADRIAAAAAAAAAAAAN
think of the first rocky movie
the character's name is adrian
ONE THING
one thing
but because it sees that it can get something out of it
it did this thing "for you" not because its your friend
what makes you think it is?
is it?
is it allied to you?
i cant be the only person who thinks like this
because he made it so
this thing is dangerous
i don't think theres no reason
i do like doing that too
drive the plot is a pretty out of character thing sir
no I think im sound
s t u p I d
does she do things because hey this is interesting I wonder how this will effect people down the line
milo is lucia a character or a player?
that's greaaaaaat
its fine you gave eric more ammo to fuck with us down the line
is it?
but you didn't do that
that sounds like a pretty good solution
have you thought about destroying the elemental and sending it back to the elemental plane?
but never any permanent ones
saying oh but we have this other problem so this problem is fine is fucking dumb
hes also a problem
as for the dragon
and that's dumb
you solved a problem by possibly making a bigger problem
great
and now your cut is infected.
and when it does youre like... oh well... if it gets worse ill do something about it
milo that's like saying oh I have a cut I hope it doesn't get worse but when it does ill do something about it
and that's bad
huh?
he does something worse over there?
now lets think about this
but what if
and that's bad I guess
hes drowning animals for blood
back to my hypothetical
im going to talk
ow that you did that
so again
youre inept
great you did it can I talk now?
greaaaaaaat
you move him to this well. hes not drowning cows anymore
ok so heres a hypothetical
don't you want to know what the fuck hes going to do down there?
and you want him to relocate to an underground reservoir
so you researched enough to know that he eats animals for their blood
very cool
gj kicking the can down the road sir
go die mars
that's you rn
look up England's genius plan of containing hitler
and so you want to give it more stuff with the hopes it will behave?
you appeasing this thing got us into this mess
just a question
isn't the bead part of your holy symbol?
oh hey that thing you retards did came to bite us in the ass. yall want to go deal with the fucking thing?
how long would it take miles' blacksmith to make the 4 sets of gear i requested
but hide armor? shit guys we cant let those peasants arm themselves in bundles of deerskins
youd think the crossbow and the shortsword would be where the prices got spiked if the govt wants to prevent a riot
hide armor is 10 gold sir
most of that is coming from the almost 400% price hike for hide armor
to 116
so prices went from 55.5gp for one set of the gear i requested
still want those uniforms tho
have to scavenge my munitions now
time to start looting fucking bodies i guess
you counting your bolts mars?
im not even sure if its worth buying for this then if they are price gouging
theres that
so
the only downside is if i don't maintain my control over them every 24 hours they bug out and try to kill everything with a living soul
and they follow every order to the fucking letter
these ones don't eat, don't sleep, and don't demand payment
why get a squad of elven archers when i can make archers myself
and having a firing line of skellingtons sounds pretty necro
im a fucking necromancer i gotta necro shit
yes
ik legit prices im asking if thieves guild gets it cheaper
for 4 of each piece of gear
for 4 of each piece of gear
just quote me on how much this entire thing costs
lovely
my idea was to stuff them with cloth when they put on the uniform to give them some shape
shit they're even smart enough to operate siege equipment
just as how they can use weapons
they can wear armor
yes
its fine
i already stand out
my intention is to gear 4 skeletons in something that completely covers their bodies so I can have them around in public spots
its fine if they stand out in public but im pretty sure nobody is going to harass a guy with his visor down for having his visor down
while hes bodyguarding someone of some import
wouldn't a merc at work?
a guard wears his helmet everywhere right?
seeing 4 people who cover themselves in a helmet shouldn't be out of the norm
there are dipshits walking around in full armor and weapons all the time
for fantasy it really doesn't have to be anything special it could just be a fucking full face helmet
that's irl
irl or fantasy?
but i still need 4 uniforms
if that's too much i could deal with only 3 sets of all that gear mars
or from the bank
so i think ill have to borrow from either party funds
i don't think i personally have the gold to make it happen atm since i only have 75 on person which isn't even enough to buy 4 crossbows
im looking to buy 4 sets of hide armor, 4 shields, 4 shortswords, 4 light crossbows, and 40 bolts
mars when you buy weapons n shit from the guild do you get friend's prices or no
if I have to commission the tailor to do that that's fine
I want to see if I can acquire 4 sets of matching uniforms that completely cover the individual wearing them
at least the survey you had to do for school didn't say you had autism
so enjoy milo you have a 5th level paladin with a mount n shit to do your laundry or something I don't fucking know
youd be more easy to bear if you didn't mask what you did in artifice
so willfully cruel
either youre too simple to understand or willfully cruel
I only need to hear: I trafficked slaves
your thieves guild isn't either
you aren't a benefit to this city
your narrative maybe but truth isn't as malleable
mars
slavery
im not you
and most importantly of all
i don't make them worse
I don't glut myself on the crippling problems in this city
are you being smart with me?
like what exactly vermin?
penny would fit right in as a societal leech
or any of the cool boys and girls
or Nathan drake
that's not how Indiana jones and laura croft would do it
isn't that in the city?
feelsblyatman
cant go tomb raiding?
do you want to die
not milos
You are standing amidst my achievements
I hate you
yall should listen to me more
see
and I said yes
so some pally came in and asked to serve lucia under her reformist church for 120gp a month which is undermarket for what he is
probably
thats because hes more balanced than that
hes balanced
nightstalker
oh
he is amused as i was amused by miles post
an amused british man watching the colonial line scatter under cannonfire?
milo once
myself twice
youve let multiple other people in there
unless theyre static npcs and are essentially stats
if you help them with a personal problem you might change their outlook on that eric
so you might have trouble with that
youre caustic
oh but then again
but if they are loyal to you that could be something you can use
have you tried cultivating a relationship with your petty? if they are loyal only to your gold then they would bail once gold stops coming in
so the next time some fuckwit breaks into our house to leave an incriminating note ill be warned
at which point the party will intercept his smaller entourage and fight him then
im pretty sure jett and mars want to kill miren with the hopes that the death of his son would draw joseph away from his host
its the fucking best we have
alarm triggers and can give a silent message to the caster that he can receive even when unconscious
im aware but this is for when its nighttime and we're asleep
its a ritual spell i can do it again and again and again
do i have to tell you that i do that eric or can we just assume i do that every night
so i gotchu
im in house
and so will hold person
i don't care how rough and tough you are blight will still hurt like a bitch
and honestly since i can cast alarm a bunch i might as well beef up security in our estate by alarming doors and shit we don't want people sneaking in
so wed be given an alarm when hes out and about
if we're afraid that the dragon will keep going out and eating house staff i could cast alarm outside his door
just a question did we want to spend our downtime on doing stuff for ourselves or for the party because i haven't had a chance to really do anything for myself
and the money we owe?
you have someone who literally dampens emotion by existing
the fuck? im not orpheus
i fucking wrote these god damn couplets and you retards are going to listen to them
or at least spend the time to secure a showtime
i want to actually get to use the theater at some point so can i spend my week with that
if he charges us that would be big stupid
you and me
im sure he remembers who was in the cart with him
and im ok with making you retards give me one
but wed need a wizards tower
rituals are my shit
im a fucking wizard
its pretty good
if it was we could melt it down and sand flakes off of it so wed have poisonous flakes of metal to spike food or drinks with if we need to take on fey
damn I thought it was just a special metal
is it just a special metal or is it a magic item as well
you want to go looking for the Old Blood
lets just find cool stuff
we don't have money for that shit
the wizard needs spells the more spells the wizard has in his book the more powerful he is.
the only people with magic items are mars and milo
we need to find magic items for the rest of our party
but yeah if we as a party want to become more powerful
and that's cool
and that's cool
alright
uhh
id like to know so I can actually see what I can get done before the game
wait so is it 7 or 8
Milo is a coomer 
how about the riddle thing that was in the box on the beach?
i couldn't find it at his house
do you know where to find yero's chest yet?
i didn't do the beauty potion quest yet
so that's what it does
feelsweridman
cant even cast grounding for more than 3 seconds
i blow people up with lightning
they changed how leveling works
enderal
I have blue lightning and green lightning. its fucking great
im doing entropy elementalism hybrid
whats your build miles?
umm
And yes the last name is pronounced like the soda
How pragmatic
TELL THEM 
Tell them the only truth in this world comes from an exact differential
Tell them miles
If it ain’t pathway independent I Don’t Want To Heat About It
I can’t see 5 feet in front of me and right now my mind only operates in state functions 
I’m strung out and have been operating on 3 hours of sleep a day for the last week
Or I’m just not playing
If every time I do something crazy we have to berate Eric for a week about it I’m not playing a crazy person
You make me sad Mars
So until the end of this campaign you are playing with former mage commander Adrian Lacroix, arcanist division
So I promised Eric that this is the last time I’m switching PCs and I meant it
Cry some more
Y’all cried a lot
K
For the wizard Eric
I’d rather do an intro
and do you want to do an in game introduction of the new pc or is it a “he’s here now”
Did you take that guy?
put a weirdchamp on his account
alright
do we even have money to pay these fucking people
what are these people good for again
almost none of that means anything to me
that's not what I saw first
you said you had real life shit to do
are we off this week btw?
miles ted talk
getting berated by foreign people while sitting in jungle waiting for my cooldowns to come back so I can cast spells and randomly get a kill 10 minutes later
only b0fa gave you the gaming experience I craved
I see the shame of not getting into an actually good game got to you
3 space marines
very cool
thank you china
hearthstone has an autobattler game mode now
fucking heretic
did you fucking dive in the chernobyl public pool?
why do you seem to have more
only have the one man
no mars id need a lot more than just that
as if that would help with my self loathing
thats me
you fucking retard
and youd be able to see all the colors of the rainbow with all your tabs open
you get kaleidoscope vision
if you throw a rock at your monitor and crack its screen
listen mars
tf i just have my character sheet, r20, skype, and a tab of youtube playing fucking starwars music or smth
of whoevers talking
its in a corner or smth. skype is pretty good at showing you the face
i once said facecams but everyone shot me down
its greaaaaaaaaat
you just do it
if i flip one of the other players off i dont have to say: i flip you off
i liked it more than the screen thing
mars didnt you like the irl thing we did
all fucking 11 of them
now its been 2 years and i still talk to all of them
i mean yeah they were strangers for like... the first month
that was where i met my irl game
i dont know about any AL places in santa monica since aero hobbies closed down
but people deal with it
also your character has to be completely legal and can only draw from 2 source books which is kinda lame
that is AL
yes
uhhhh we still get treasure points for that right?
the game ended right there and i shit you not someone actually went up to the dm and was like:
someone at the table had a seziure near the end of the night
this is something that really happened in AL
people are singleminded and only want loot and thats it
trust me its totally different than playing with us
al is sweaty and gross
why are you playing with strangers?
and free
you borrow from people at the table man. thats what i did when i was in sm
you really dont
and i bought it for 5 dollars and im pretty sure it works just as good as any of that technicolor stuff
because i have one
eric how many sets of dice do you have
nsa dont mind me 
thats like
stop breathing
i like the wizard more
yall want to play with a wizard or a fighter next
dont know you either
k
k
probably will
and even i don't buy that lol
i did the thing in question
thats a no then
and belongs to a person that has frontal lobe development
thats not esoteric and openended
i honestly have a character backstory that's way more structured if youd like to hear it
do you want to do more to me for what I did eric?
or at least shit I did on my part
there seems to be a lot of contention about that week
if having someone on your team whose underleveled bothers you you might want to find another player
it doenst matter to me
if i die and lose a level then ill play underleveled
i liked the sniper rogue but death saves are a bitch
hes great
i like the death monk
unless I find something I like
no
then I make a fucking new one
until they die
if theyre crazy, then I do crazy stuff
I don't have any attachment to them and I lean into an aspect of who they are
it honestly doesn't matter if i lose a character
dont care
don't know
and tbh I would have too
bite me
and ill keep playing like one
that's craaaaaazy man
w0w 6 people with 70 health each beat me
fucking rangers cast more kinds of spells than you
plus 1
since all you fucking people do is hex
more like one anyways
im sorry I cant hear you over my more than 2 spell slots
fuck you warlock spammer
which I like... all wizards care about
wizard is the superior casting class. its a fact. they did get an expanded spell list
then wallow in your ignorance
r00n figher
please spell it right
r00ns
i like it alot
I like the figher one
did you look at the new subclasses for fighter, ranger, and rogue?
UAs are optional maaaaaaaan
cough cough barbarians cough cough
because the game was toooooooootally balanced
ok boomer
we have 2 free weeks before next game right eric?
now you can play a sekiro without having to pick the most useless monk archetype
hey guys remember how kensei are the only monks that can pick martial weapons as their monk weapons? dehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh we gave that shit to everyone now enjoy
the monk one makes kensei fucking useless lol
next time tho
tough
I don't know what that is
ac pepeg
fucking pepeg
not mask?
what are your invocations?
do you have agonizing?
are you done spamming jinx shot then?
do you have e-blast yet?
at lvl 4
if the charis is applied to the necro damage, youd be getting 1d4+10 temp hp
I wonder how it works with agonizing since hes letting it apply to other cantrips
as a warlock
its offered to you as well
real shit mars blood curse is obscene
lol
i mean i did
if we're off this week do we have more free time?
but ok
that's not what a soliloquy is
well
i don't want to hear a fucking soliloquy
I don't know if anything is happening
well that's a fucking lie
that's amazing
im sure we all want to listen to you sputter for half a minute every time you have to come up with an npcs name
god no
no
hes the only other fucking person on the r20
again, miles just said that because he wanted to see your reactions. and you didn't let him down
I think the word that described you mars was "uncle tom"
you never were
sorry milo you cant avoid being repressed just like that
that's like saying "im no longer black"
you don't just walk out of being a gamer
then put that in the chat
he just said watch this
miles and I are in a call rn
youre incredible miles
about as smart as one too
fucking walking corpse
or maybe the decision isn't yours and you go back in the corner where you belong
imbecile
where the fuck do you get off
harrumph
and you fall into a boiling whitewater river
the floor under you as you cross a bridge shapes out under you
hows this
shall I plan your demise?
oh my he even planned it out
youre fucking deaaaaaaad
if you fail
but remember you only get one shot
im sure
bite me
I wouldn't antagonize the person with the single largest killing potential in our entire group
youd have to be a stunted halfwit to not see that
which is why I recommended that we simply go to the location at night and collect them then. aside from the fact that this is an obvious bait to draw out the people responsible for the previous break in
they are being left in cages until they die of exposure or starvation
they aren't being hanged from rope mind you
it doesn't fucking matter
the next day it might be a cannibal cult
one day its your rancid church
its whoever is in charge
fucking animals
and they get to watch it
it just matters that someone dies
it doesn't matter to these fucking people who dies
just as much as they would enjoy watching you hang from your entrails despite all the "good work" you've been doing
if its anything like how the roman plebians behaved then yes. they would enjoy watching these people die
assuming rescuing these fucking people is what we're commited to doing
or we have to collect them at night when the crowd is gone
so we either have to get them out before they leave the church to avoid the crowd
and this is a public event so there will be a lot of people hanging around watching this shit
again miles' crew is being paraded to a particular bridge to hang until dead
doubly so for tempest clerics
and cleric is probably the single most retarded 1v1 classes in the fucking game
the thing is with player vs player 1v1s, especially if one of the pcs is a high level caster and the other is a martial class, if the martial fails a save then the fight is fucking over
then after that any cleric worth two shits would blight you or something
hold person lasts just as long as your cloak
hold person lasts just as long as your cloak
jett can fly for 10
mars is literally useless without the item in a 1v1. it lasts a minute
im sure
hows your wisdom score rogue?
more than one spell slot
and I have hold fucking person
wait a minute im pretty sure any one of us could beat your ass
or jett
or milo
or miles
as if you could remove me
we can see them suffer in penance mere moments before they are commited to an eternity of torturous pain regardless of status
pretty much every folk
and the folk in between
and also about the rich folk
technically yes
and youd SAVE them?
those people are the very vermin that made the city a toxic cesspool
why
let ruin come to this rancid city
im ok with that
that's not suspicious at all.
just saying, the people we're trying to collect are to be paraded out of their cells in the cathedral to hang until dead in cages off a bridge... just about a week after other people who belong to the same heretical faith escaped from their prison within the citadel
So we could just wait until they’re being moved then go collect them
So we could just wait until they’re being moved then go collect them
They’re just plain old heretics
These guys aren’t being used in the retard experiments 
Also the prisoners in question are also going to be moved out of the cathedral and left to die somewhere else
Fuck you pansy
the more I learn about this shitty place the more I understand that its fucking anathema to me
and if we start a fight everyone in the church has bless on them so its like they are anywhere between 5-20% more powerful
and the stairs are guarded by magic statues
apparently I know where the stairs to the basement is
apparently not
because jesus hates me or something
ok well apparently theres a lot of jesus energy from under the church and I cant make a tunnel inside it
vlad tepes style
and for enforcing the Miracle's demands of penance
for the express purpose of defacing altars of petty gods
my 4th spell slot is for stone shape
in... the darkest dungeon
yeah who cares about the nuances in religious doctrine or possibly rescuing those few survivors of your faith when theres an estate to reclaim
and be turned into a wet smear
enter into the spirit guardian chipper shredder
please
gotta clear them warrens
there will be a bunch of swine people there tho
no
maybe if there are warrens that run under it i could stoneshape an entrance
i could do some snooping to see if theres a way to get into the church without walking through the front door
im not certain what i ought to do
idk im not allowed to reciprocate like pleasantries
so
no less than what she told me
i was about to say i might be able to help you find them by doing some sleuthing but i don't think im allowed in that church
we do have freetime on our hands rn right?
i don't think he knows who we are
I don't think he knows we took it
is there something I could help anyone else with in that time I don't particularly have anything id like to see through
we get a week of free time in the city now right?
and the chaotic neutral cleric of nature. who hates her
the only people capable of sending is the neutral good cleric of light
entropy might be slow. but it is certain.
eventually
and it will
I only insinuated that she should kill herself
its an armsy
whose playing tonight again?
its almost a catch 22
you preformed as expected
and in that way
you never fail to disappoint me
when are we playing again?
could be good for your dex or something
as long as I maintain conc. you get advantage on any skill check from one stat for an hour
do you want enhance ability when you go do your mission impossible style break in?
doing stupid shit by yourself again
ohhhhhhhhhhh mars
i no longer have those abilities
I don't have good stealth
don't care
still no mengsk
that's greaaaaaaaaaaaaat
that one game that has about 8 people playing it still
oh btw they apparently are putting deathwing in hots
do you know garbage man kuroky?
very cool
thank you trash man john
I should be fine
go to hell
real society hours?
oh?
didn't we at one point want to rescue a blacksmith whos a religious prisoner?
I don't think so? I thought this guy kinda just confiscated some persons stuff and so her immediate response is to hire a bunch of lunatics to murder a govt official
just let me know what you need me to do so I have the appropriate spells for it
put me where you will I don't care
miles explicitly said he wanted to engage in murder
that's impressive
is this water as hot as molten lava?
we're fine in that regard
water walk lets me walk on fucking acid
that is something I can give up to 10 people for an hour
if you want to get to a point that requires a boat I can just waterwalk
idk
or i could just... hold person people
that along with guidance which i have
pass without trace or enhance ability
if i know you want to do a break in i can pick up spells to help with that
i am a druid so i have access to my entire catalogue of spells
im not exactly stealthy so idk I can be a small creature you can bring me in
it might help with your break in
I have a free dispel magic cast per long rest as well as a on demand detect magic unlimited times from a feat
also he broke into your estate, turned your greenhouse into a fucking jungle, and sat there until someone found him. then he gave you the letter
a letter explaining that hes here to help you, and where to find noxalas if you wanted to talk
its just instead of melt your insides I make a tree eat your flesh and petrify your skin
well I mean still that icon
me druid now
things were changed
thank you sir
thank you sir
and edited it later
you misspelled serf
I see.
I actually don't know what you just said
more like.... make people rip eachother apart with crown of madness
invis is not my style
go back to jail
and that's pretty much it
on the day of the session noxalas leaves early in the morning and directs this new guy to show up at the estate to offer his services to morozov
so im rerolling to someone who will actually not say no to any vile schemes of yours
so im rerolling to someone who will actually not say no to any vile schemes of yours
ok I talked to eric and we both agreed that having the party want to do one thing while one pc refuses to do it isn't fun
Nerevar X Dagoth Ur
I want to rekindle my very platonic relationship with the resurrected form of my best friend
because I bought the game
and that's ok
his conception was the result of a 2 week amphetameme binge
a man whose gone mad with immortality and stuck a piece of pottery on his head.
daddy dagoth baby
whatever the fuck he is. I don't know yet
because he is actually crazy and violent
and he literally wont say no a single time
but hey if I reroll you guys get to play with this
I do what I think is an ok thing to do. I haven't killed a single person thus far except 2 drow. but they're a special circumstance.
true neutral
no
im rerolling
and if i have to say no more and more with this group
but now im saying no to this murder plan
nothing came of that
i should have said: no
day one i was told to find someone to manufacture addictive substances
i shouldve
you shouldve
i agree
im playing the bard until i literally don't think i can with yall anymore. 
who the fuck knows
maybe even aberrant mind.
didn't decide yet
or shadow sorc.
enjoy a drow necromancer wizard
and i will use a character that fits more with the murderous people in that rancid estate
if it comes to that, noxalas will leave the party.
i am
its not my job to agree to participate in a hit. if that becomes my job I quit
and is asking me to be intimately involved in it
and w/out my direct involvement
something that i was told was going to happen w/ or w/out me
no
again
I helped your boss ONCE because it didn't involve me doing aside from what I was doing already
which is still not a fucking good thing.
youre asking me to be willfully ignorant to murder
because if you do it like you did in this skype chat
how exactly do you present your request to me
i am not a vigilante. 
so no
stabbing him isnt how i would want him to go down
and can prove it
if that is something i know
if that is something i know
i am not complicit in murder
i am not in on this fuckwit plan
I am not exactly a psychotic murderer
no red flags here
stop asking questions
they are good and virtuous to a fault
no ofc not
especially considering that same clergy seems to cherrypick when to enforce their tenants based on circumstances
which is not to say that I am one such person no absolutely not
one MIGHT
if there exists a centralized clergy that takes extreme views on the worship of people other than their sainthood, one might wonder about the veracity of the history texts that extol the virtues of said sainthood
theres that
well some of us actually know how to read so
which real historians literally never do
if you accept history as written
is absurd at best
if that thing could be considered divine, then none of these fucking gods are worth spit. to allow something so dim, so ignoble to be among their number
in the words of the illustrious, imperious, ingenious archmage Carl: Insipid and Ignorant.
and that embodies a virtue?
we have a gemi apologist on our hands boys
the vision of the future was fairly explicit
didn't know what he was doing?
I should hope not
So no it’s on brand for his rancid spawn to be a failure in that regard
Despite the fact that that same character caved in to his own fear of death, abandoned his heritage to reap benefits of having elven blood, and was a conspirator for the genocide of all humans in that kingdom he was born in
Let it drown in a sea of sand
Which we will not do
So we may bring it to some larger body of water
We could try to convince it to return to it’s smaller form
If it required us to get to the river we put it in
It means it only wants to make more of itself or make itself larger/stronger whatever
Is that in character?
It is a creature that exists solely to propagate itself
You are using human characteristics for something notably inhuman
are you about to get back to work?
im ok
doesn't that item not work with your alignment?
valve would only give us that much shit if ti was in C H I N A
thanks china for the great battlepass this year
C H I N A
incels out in force
no i haven't
i haven't had the opportunity for real gamer hours
I can play this weekend but not next
it really do be like that I guess
I have opinions about that
egoism
if we were Kantian someone would have stabbed a party member by now
enslaved ethics
ah, yes
has he made you do anything malicious directly?
but he seems super hands off rn
and we have no fucking clue who his patron is
my understanding is that demons don't like to share their toys with others.
my understanding is that demons don't like to share their toys with others.
so who cares
never met the guy but because people always firmly believe the first story they hear they just accept that hes the baddie
that's literally it
which is to help their chief in a slap fight with another orc boss
the orcs know where they are but cant go after them because then the human barony will go beat the shit out of them and they wont tell us until we do something for them
we went to go looking for them
ok so remember those missing shipments that mattered to some guy who youre supposed to be family friends with?
would you normally be eager to drink something with the same look and consistency as snot?
id do as the romans do
ok
you want to force your religion down on a tribal people who've recently been displaced from land they used to own?
what am I reading rn
I wonder if that actually works
if you find the black rose try using the bucket with it
ofc you harvest drudanae
you don't fucking dissolve an acid you neutralize it with a base
it still is
oh fuck off mars
wait fuck
a solvent is dissolved in a solute
I do not
what the fuck is an anti acidic solvent
a solvent is something that dissolves in a solute
that's good for me since Thursday is the only day I don't have an 8am
honestly Fridays were my best day but if we have to we could try Wednesday after 6ish
kinda need to know soonish
so are we game this week or not
n
have fu
pffft
(emo) fucking conformists
oh hey its southpark
(emo) gosh. youre all fucking conforming
(emo) gosh. youre all fucking conforming
so basically fire emblem
its a dating sim
im just saying its on steam
I didn't play it
just thought yall should know that
also the kfc dating sim is out
what
what items are you referring to
im ok I cant go super late tho
Noxalas would accept the boof if doom guy was offering
theyre probably the ones who hijack them
im fairly certain its these firegarde mercs
you have no honor
I don't think so
ill know by Wednesday night
im not certain though
I don't think I can either
Very cool
Very responsible 
but coordinating 6 people? fucking impossible
then I would say we should miss a week
2 is too much
missing one is acceptable
if we delay every time one person cannot make it, we will never actually get to play
that's crazy
skype backing me up
I do not remember that
ok
oh wow I ask if you wanted to talk and you told me to go die
and milo asks and youre like
fucking weeb
fucking weebs
his party is saturday
erics birthday is Friday

Keep in mind that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
What's your name?
Good for you
what if the lol blebs realized that league was just dumbed down dota?
also im game
go back to Quebec
I am just curious
I don't think Ill do anything with only just you mars.
What did you find?
who do I have exactly
are we doing mine this Friday?
REEL NA TEEM POG
Oh here we go again 
i got the only thing i wanted.
did you get any spicy items?
i did
did you give gaben his money yet miles?
thank you skype
Fair enough.
if we aren't going to continue it then we should decide to do so asap 
so we decided not to continue mine
Good then
oh? someone better not be using an alphacore
(smile)
I am online now
for my game im not doing it this week but I can play Friday
I’ll be home shortly
Eventually I want an in person thing but not today
To about 7:30
I’ll be late can we move it later?
a time? I can only do after 6
if you uploaded caenis in a different game you should still have access to any pictures in your art library
k
k
the reason im making you guys do point buy and am hard on nonofficial material is because I want people to be balanced
send it to me first
if you want to roll d6s and cheer for getting big numbers go ahead. they wont be your stats tho
?
youre point buying btw
because then youre gonna end up fighting a fucking enemy with player levels
man just pick some shit from the phb or xanathars or something. i don't want to have to balance for homebrew
so. no.
which is like... another plane of existence
unless youre referring to guildmasters of ravnica
also there never was a planeshift ravnica official
im pretty sure that stuff is UA man
ravnica? seriously? 
what page of what book
well...
if you can give me a page number in a book then its legal
die
jett is the only one with a sheet rn i think
jett is the only one with a sheet rn i think
youre 2
and for added help, youre probably going to spend all your time on the sword coast.
i cant actually tell
can someone tell me if the link I sent works?
no.
also the game is in faerun. its an established setting. if you need to do some research to figure out a character backstory theres plenty of material
for the tabletop game called dungeons and dragons: 5th edition
you can be something you will find in the phb or any expansion books put out by wizards of the coast
assuming you don't die
your personal backstory literally doesn't matter to me. ill use it later for character focused stories n shit later but rn to get things started we're doing a module and then some general adventuring shit
youre signing on to be part of an adventurers group called acquisitions incorporated. You are promised the opportunity to open your very own franchise somewhere in Faerun if you preform well in a training facility in an undisclosed location (its in a demiplane)
oh and heres your backstory
my thing is mostly going to be theatre of the mind btw
join it and ill give you a character sheet
so that's the thing
Sushi Sushi Running Low On Retards Need Backup Alligator
so did we want to do my thing this Saturday?
Session one would be a module but then it’s all me
I did want to try running my game and seeing how you guys like it
I actually take back what I said I am good for Saturday but only after 7
But I already have warband 
I already own mount and blade warband

Good argument.

i mean if you really want to come
im pretty sure i can still get to you
how much further
i have a car
...
are you in mars?
im good to wait if the other boys who'll be joining us are
I figured the whole point of waiting after 12 was so you could join us
as a large cranium manbaby, sseth knows how to take hold of the cultural subconsciousness of our society
almost 4k a vid
change that
about 3k a vid
its on his patreon
milo do you wish to acquire sustenance with the lads today
in which case... carry on citizen
unless its the hat dance youre interested in
you could just search hava nagila
I mean
getting appointments and seeing physicians? 
oh?
are we heading out or what?
its about 12 and I have a car
do yall negusi want to get lunch somewhere?
you racist
Nice meme
Im sorry sir. Im not a megacuck.
that's a minus one sir
Not even pretending
well neither do i. but i did promise myself that if i ever gave money to pateron, the first person id give it to was him
sseth put out another one
also for you boys in the merchant's guild
what the fuck
:/
i thought milo said he couldn't do anything saturday
i think its saturday
what exactly is that and where is that happening
so we're booling then?
I guess I did
Indubitably.
Did not
Did not
But I did not
fucking idiot
id never talk to a girl
did you really think that would ever happen?
mars
Are we really?
are we dnd this Saturday?
Why not?
I hope so
I did not think so
So are you
you left because it was time for real bofa hours
and um
what if you were talking to a girl
so umm
just gonna run a module
but if milo cant dm I can do a oneshot irl
You told me
so milo cant run dnd this week
that's a good way to be asked to leave.
guess not
are we going out
serious question for serious gamers
oh? we drinking piss tea
piss off
so
skype doesn't have an auto response for that
Okay, I will
ill simply respawn. my gamer biology makes me practically immortal
oh you poor thot
did I mention im also a gamer? Gamers have wills of steel.
mars as a person whose been alive for over 20 years, I have grown numb to the idiocy of those around me. you are powerless for I have become inured to minds whose faculties are dwarfed by my own.
in the year of our lord 2019 thats just unacceptible
mars' character is also sexist
you forgot the rampant spouts of incompetence and anti-party actions
injoker P E R S O N A
Fair enough.
die
Haha, no problem
Y E S
go to jail
and excellent depictions of honorable combat
this is now a mordhau chat 
No problem, enjoy!
Thanks anyway!
Why not?
7

Oi! Josuke!
What's yours?
Yeah, I guess so
as per usual
sumail looking like a shithead still
I am not alone!
as do I. and the day after
but not for miles
the workings of my mind far outstrip yours
don't presume to know what I think
I am always down
good for both
milos asleep
yes
or yes
no
pfffffft
i have no idea what any of that means
i don't have anything to do sunday
any time fr
k
i don't think milo is even online
mmhmm
ok
welp
im guessing not
did we even set a time for today
I can play tomorrow
im not sure about tomorrow tho
he knows we're not playing today
we played Monday with only 3 players
the thing is we said we were going to try playing even if we don't have everyone
and got stupid high
I wouldn't play dnd if you have shit to do
and not friday
and not friday
im pretty sure milo said he wanted to play on Saturday this week
oh? we mald now?
i kill myself
i don't really want to start that late
i have to go to work tomorrow
is it just us? no jett?
k ready
I need to take a shower
:/

Wednesdays are completely off the table for me
I work from 9-6 every Monday, tuseday, and thursday

I said I can
the fuck
I just trying to meet expectations
so
the internet told me im autistic and take everything literally
?
?
Oh, I will be
I am with you
but I mean if it fits your own narrative to ignore milos statement then... I suppose it doesn't exist
[1562974542] Milo Amoore: Mars its tmrw at around 7-7:30 start time

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
and not next week
im pretty sure its today
mordhaus chat is greaaaaaaaaaaaaat
milo hasn't responded to any of this but I believe he works on Saturdays 
don't we usually do this sort of shit at like... 6 or something
College
College
I am in college
I am in college
I cant tell
did we get a new time for the next game?
umm
Woah. That's crazy. Have you ever done crystal sorceries?
you can thank me for getting you out of crybabby jail btw
also jett died
the end
then we broke out of jail
were accused of purposefully kidnapping you in a huge farce of a trial
we got back to the future
oh
wont ever get food poisoning
just don't eat
are you ok
umm
gooooood
good
allow your retinas to sear and burn
leave it to the homosexual to ruin a good thing
Neigh
Neigh
im good for it
Burke, rated to be about as safe as Bradford England
And get mugged in a seedy alley
I can’t wait to go to Burke 
Oh?
did we talk about playing tomorrow since that's when miles is good or no?
its gonna be hard to coordinate 6 monkeys to match schedules
yeah I think so
elon musk has you covered man
that's a yikes from me dog
I bet you are
speculated
speculated to be tomorrow
i can do earlier in the day for the game if its good for everyone else
because they dont need me and im still on call not a full employee
tomorrow*
so im not going to work today
Yeah, I agree
session?
what are you referring to?
?
why even talk to them
we're smarter than any of the sjw furries in that shitty town
man
shit filled water
yeah but still
also that fisherman was fishing in shit filled water btw
that is something we should explore
like 1 gold here means a lot less than one gold in the future?
is there actual inflation in this time?
thats something
thats… 2 silver
idk
didn't you get a quarterstaff or something?
I don't remember what everyone got but I think I could get some gold for mine
id honestly sell the prizes we got in the mystery boxes to get cash
Not to mention the possibility that he sends us forward too far or not far enough 
As well as acquiring the materials and space he needs
As in not letting the inventor die
I’d reckon getting the goods to get back takes priority
spells are love spells are life
and money which I need for more SPELLS
we need to legally murder things to acquire xp
after we get back to our time, we should probably do some fucking QUESTING
he would demand that ALL THE HISTORICAL TEXT MAKE NO SMALL MENTION OF HOW THE EVOKER RESCUED THE KING
I think my character would rather use the kings rescue as a way to feed his ego
that's a nice way to be declared an enemy of the state
mayhaps thine goddess, Fina, shall grace thee with her favor with a keep.
oh? does Lautrec, Knight of Carim have funds hidden away?
i think my favorite pages were the keeps
ehh
200? 
500ish pages
its the play
and make big money
I think we have it from a long time ago
so session 1 is to be about participating in race riots?
so session 1 is to be about participating in race riots?
I mean its canonized by the history books
should someone do a wrap-up for Michael since his character was actually somewhat important to what happened?
KONO DIO DA
theres always J 0 J 0
if were not
if were not
well
if were game then im game
just got back home
im here
Is that a yes to delay?
Up to you dude
I mean Michael is here tomorrow. Want to give it one more day to get better?
Still sick milo?
ohhh boyyyyyyyyyyy
I work from 10-6
do we all have a time were good for tomorrow?
retard
then admit defeat
Understandable.
has knight Lautrec ever done dmt?
im not one to be outdone
but fr is it good enough or are we going crazy like we used to and making pages and pages of useless shit
its canon now
that's crazy
I literally only did a short paragraph about how I want to be the biggest brain there is
do you want any places in my backstory miles?
i was asleep for most of this
because im working tomorrow and I get back at like 7ish pm
we delaying to tomorrow?
Milo it must be a token
Cease thine intrusions fiend
Ignore him milo! Let it be a square 
You don’t get to agree with me!
Also goddamn it make his picture a token 
He’s back by 4?
Where is he?
K
I can drive over
I’m almost back from my walk
Do you want to grab lunch btw?
Is he in class Rn?
Invite him?
Did what?
If you say no then that’s it
I’m ok with it but it’s your game milo
If they fail as teachers then he most likely won’t stay
It’ll be on them to hold his hand milo
Then I trust their judgment and I’m cool with it
If Michael and miles thinks he’s cool
I mean
im good for it
im good any time post 2ish
we'll see if I can make the time for it mars
also maybe
but forreal what time are we looking at?
make a backstory first dingus
umm no
and take some Dayquil you feeble man you
when do you want to start playing?
that's pretty cool
AND GAVE LIFE ITS FULLEST BRILLIANCE
THAT WHICH COMMANDED THE STARS
oh Elden Ring!
the E L D E N R I N G
maybe the path to enlightenment relies on...
because lets be honest ill never use any of it
i didn't write pages of stuff
p o s t I t
A scion and scholar of the mystical arts, Karl Faer has spent decades learning and relearning cantrips and spells of power. But in his craft he is limited by his mortal lifespan. What is a several centuries of study when the scope of the field of magic is limitless? Karl found it simply unacceptable. A high elf deserves better. But perhaps the answer lies with magic itself. Through spells and sorcery, Karl's age of enlightenment may last forever. Taking up the title of The Evoker, Karl first invested his mnemonic prowess on explosive might, so he may protect himself in battle. His next field, the dark arts of necromancy. Therein lies the answer to immortality, a way to become the eternal scholar of magic. Ages will pass, but The Evoker will never fade to nothing.
haven't seen that one before
nice picture btw
ok
fuck you
did I use any of the lore milo made? FUCK NO
backstory written boys
DAVAI CYKA
and in the near future i cant do sundays
that's my schedule
i cant do Mondays, tusedays, or Wednesdays.
that includes myself. not trying to slap down everyone else
so I feel as if 1 or 2 of us cant make it, the show must go on
in the future tho itll be fucking impossible to coordinate us monkeys to get everyone in the game
im good with waiting for michelle so we can have a full house on game 1
Michael doesn't know when hes back
guess he really do can not be do be dopa
w0w
don't tell me youre still in a summer course rn
alright biles its bofa time
but was shattered by someone or something
that commanded the stars, giving life its fullest brilliance
an esoteric thing and or person
k boys character idea
What's your name?
what do you do?
we find a man in a dungeon cell. he wants you to set him free so he can get back to work. He promises that he will reward you later, he just needs some time.
What's your name?
milos choice tbh
i thought we aren't doing Thursday this week because Michael is out
So wait till we get Bichael?
Umm
Eric is in Santa Barbara 
Die
If more folks can do Wednesday than Thursday do Wednesday 
But I can do Thursday 
I personally can’t do Wednesday 
W H E N S C A M P A I GN
When’s session zero Bilo?
Also idk to what you were referring to when you were talking about your other character 
No he doesnt
uhhh. im gay
ok
oh
figured
did he?
after he comes back from work
i don't remember if milo said he wanted to play today
yeah I thought they were jets roles
Do we know when we’re playing?
That’s pretty much all I have going for me
I have a large cranium
Maybe.
you gonna do a sketch?
yes
conference call with the executives is over?
oh?
alright milo
im ready to make my character
the link to join is in the game but you know what
alright milo
that's the link
look in the chat and at the top theres a grey bar
alright milo
im ready to make my character
link the r20
alright milo
im ready to make my character
make the r20
alright milo
What does that mean?
hmm
k
tell me if it works whenever you can
im done working on it for now.
when you get the chance, tell me how to give you the option to put suggestions
do you think by making this google doc im doing what I accused eric of, making bullshit noone cares about?
him being milo?
omegalul
gotta say
I kinda want to give this to everybody and see who wants to pick it up. or ill just do it myself when I have the time
whenever
and its very not done
a very biased setting
its a setting
uhh no
whenever you have the time
watch eric not read it despite him complaining about no one reading his garbage
last statement tho
sending it to the lads?
in the title of part 2
i was gonna add Oh hey that's me
nvm
or rather I think it would detract from it
can I get editor access to put in literally 4 words in at part 2?
I like part 2
very heartwarming. very manly. very gachi.
it means im special and important to you
im glad to know im always on your mind
except instead of a degree the reward is getting yelled at by a sheltered manchild
eric's games really are homework assignments
another essay
oh my?
do you still intend to leave?
if you do, he'll blame me
if you don't, he'll blame me
stay or dont
do whatever
im glad he kicked me
honestly
my ego is fully sated
I did read his garbage
well
… I said that too
H O M E W O R K
hes not wrong
honestly
then I await the rest
k
only 2 lines of text? that doesn't satisfy my ego one bit.
was that it?
maybe because hes hypersensitive
wonder why I don't come off that way to anyone else
I guess im really negative or smth
do you want to try a screen share?
think everyone is waiting on you now
you ready?
0megalul
assuming you don't have data holding you back or whatever
you could try mobile if everything doesn't work out
and that makes him a better villain
but gus fring is way scarier
tuco is more violent and murderous than gus fring
for the dropping weapon trick, I can only steal one weapon on a turn for free
humph... idk make the scholar do the wis save
does that take a reaction?
then you fuck off to a corner
and i just cast invisibility on you
a fat hold person
heres a combo
oh
probably why command will be so gamebreaking
based
i don't remember what scholars have. it just felt like battlemaster with less hp
can he actually use that fast initiative to... do anything?
but it only takes one crit to fucking kill somebody
you might have a 10% chance to get a crit but you probably wont get to attack 10 times before youre dead
the thing is pc vs pc combat is usually quick and bloody
good fireball target
also if played as we envisioned, that group will stack on top of eachother.
silly build time?
Attilor, Ivlvia, Helios, Ghengah
we still have a full 4 of melee slappers
my cleric does
turn every one of our available characters into caricatures
yes
honestly
basically dickslapped Egypt into submission, then declared it his private property
the first emperor of rome
Augustus
there are some good ones
if you want to keep the roman theme and actually steal the name of a big brain roman
still making Romulus Remulus?
did he give you your sheet?
spice
well.. unless he throws something at me
and theres no way for him to close that gap
and theres no way for him to close that gap
then spend 35 ft to walk away
hit him
i step in
if I start my turn 5 ft from him
he doesn't have opportunity attacks
well heres the thing
but hes supposed to beat terror right?
yes
I don't think your barb can do anything if you kite with quickling step
so... walk away
just remember they cant make opportunity attacks
fucking dumb
tower shield?
whats his AC?
get that sick sick performance skill
put it in charis
he only has even stats?
also yeah
yeah
its kinda dumb
tell me how Romulus turns out
if you can abuse that, then he goes down
but again the cleric's dex and charis saves aren't that good
tower shield is fair and balanced
PRAISE THAT MOTHERFUCKING SUN
and the stupid spiritual weapon, spirit guardians combo
helios Aurelian is done. He might be a caster cleric, but hes got 48 hp and 20 AC
alright
law of thermodynamics and all that
he said something like "no i wont let you do that as such a thing doesn't have enough lifeforce for you to take"
i donno
just imagine like a squirrel in vain's pocket. and when he gets hurt he just takes it out and bites into its neck for that sick sick temp hp
because i had the idea that id use find familiar or unseen servant to make things for me to instantly murder for quick temp hp
unless kevin says "it doesn't have life force to steal"
that's walking temp hp if ive ever seen it
yep
the echo has hp right?
im down for a summonable thing with no hp TO LEECH OFF OF
im down for a summonable thing with no hp TO LEECH OFF OF
did we get the ok for that?
hmm?
do you think Romulus Remulus would kill people by punching the meat of their bones?
you can use that UA for extra fighting styles
but also what?
i mean im with it
i uh... i don think you can do that
P R A I S E T H E S U N
and be a proper light cleric
and make HELIOS AURELIAN
i can scrap the wizard
oh shit
right right
Attilor the barbarian, Romulus Remus the (im assuming fighter), Ghengah Khan the ranger, and Ivliva Caesarion the paladin will rip and tear the competition. and hopefully not us
soon tm
alright
for the great conqueror's squad
but wizard isn't IN enough
it would be replacing the wizard
you could tell me what to put in it and it would be your impromptu second
i still have a sheet
ask for another sheet?
Julia Caesar
Ivliva Kaizar?
bum rush party rip and tear
we could just have an entire group of retard melee fighters
do we just make a squad of great conquerors for the team?
Julius Caesar?
a play on alexander the great?
who would round them out?
Ghengah Khan and Attilor the Hunter
lol
assuming they're on the same team
ooga booga
yes
but throwing weapons are dogshit in 5e
i was thinking about making a spear throwing dude
what would you have done with another?
and made a grappler
you only wanted one sheet
i wasn't attacked until the end
we lost terror in the last arena fight
i think it'll be down to whose stupid gimmick happens first
i don't think we'll instantly lose
her's is powers given to her by force of will
her magic doesn't count
magic is heresy sir
G O O D L U C K
G O O D L U C K
oh btw she has mage slayer
but shes then doing 6 damage instead of 2d6+5
if she loses that, shes done
the pally only has 1 weapon in the greatsword
it be like that
yep
which aren't upgraded
she has 6 handaxes
those axes represent 220 gold each
but the ranger?
well your grappler doesnt
which lets me just double-dash, grab, and run
that shit is on the floor for a turn
so
AND IMMEDIATELY END THEIR TURN
well command drop makes them drop their shit
well i figure we're writing a playbook for our downtime
drop whatever target is holding in hands
drop is one of the listed words
actually no
he might interpret drop to be prone
maybe even throw
would it be command drop, release, or give?
i run in, pick it up, run out
they drop their weapon
command: drop
bruh
you still have command right?
what a guy
cough cough lightning storm
cough cough fireball
its whatever you want over the other tbh
half orc gets to not go down after hitting zero once
the only difference between the two is goliath gets to reduce an instance of damage
donno if it matters
because that icon is for sure a half orc
is he a goliath or half orc btw?
plans?
how about roman's downtime?
we'll see how kevin plays it
which means you might want that extra attack at lvl 5 barb
figure since youre not grappling then restraining, youd actually be attacking
keeping the point in rogue after not going for the grappling master idea?
HELL YEAH THAT GUY HAS DOPE CHARIS
do you see those tattoos and jawline
and mage has a low hp bar
pally has dog dex save
ranger cannot make mental saves to save her life
i baked a weakness in every one of my contenders
maybe not
well
honestly looking at the people we've made, i don't think we can beat them without abusing potions
on the spear
im thinking about spending it during the downtime toget a plus 1 to hit
I have 100ish gold on vain
which more often then not don't fucking matter
200 gold turns a mundane item to +1 magic status except magic tag in terms of overcoming resistances
honestly if anything needs a nerf, its weapon upgrading costs
terror's had one for a few fights
tower shield seems kinda crazy to me
or just no opportunity attacks
can you take reactions with the tower shield?
how so?
no damage?
big brain time
do it
that's kinda dumb
9 HEALING POTIONS
50 gp it is then
askin' kev
50 or 100?
i meaaaaaan. this is an arena thing. having a bunch of spells i cant have prepped means dick
how much is a potion?
i have 490 gold on a wizard
i mean healing pots are also a thing
that's pretty showy? 
…. missile snaring glove?
plate armor gay
i thought about leaving instructions on the character sheet but i think that's just trying too hard
and get the idea that your guy is supposed to grapple people
i think he'll read the sheet
I mean
so our plans of making these characters bullshit wont be his plan of making the fights... possible
hes playing them
again*
then agian
idk if he'll let you smoke up his entire arena
gotta vet the magic item as well
they are not
unless theyre in that armorer's thing
homebrewed
don't exist
bolas?
I was thinking about getting a net for the ranger
which means its always at disadvantage
and 5/15
its ranged
net is dog
turn the entire arena into heavily obscured territory
eversmoking bottle
acrobatics, athletics, performance. He's literally a fucking Adonis
S P I CE 
to get a good grip
rub it on your hands
by chalk
he wants the F R I C T I O N
ahhh i see
it is consumable tho
oil up before the fight
oil of slipperiness?
literally gigachad
HES ACTUALLY A STOIC 
hes the thinking man's grappler
headband of intellect
i donnnnno
each upgrade is 100 gold dude
just spend all your money on like 100 throwing implements
actually
yes
throwing hammers
the wizard i made still has most of his gold
what the fuck would you even spend your money on?
better than +2 bonus tbh
S T I L L G O O D T H O
its just advantage when raging
only damage
you don't get the rage bonus to athletics checks i think
fuck no
are you attacking?
who gives a shit
and get expertise in athletics
and 1 in rogue
put 4 in it
instead of 5 in barbarian
honestly, if we wanted to go full retard and do something stupid
only +2 to athletics?
aaaaaaaaaaaand miles was making fun of me again
how was milo session one?
do it
pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffft
and pay for the sleep darts
i didn't take one to upgrade my axes
whats his magic item?
did the rona take that much from you?
what are you dead inside?
i named my half orc Ghengah Khan
and a - int score
give him blonde hair
name him Gemi
do you want to make a person ill literally retard int into to try to murder at all costs?
i mean
the only way to make my blood fizz is naming your character Gemi chance
how would that piss me off again?
for the chad grappler and the stacy murder ranger?
do you want to coordinate names
waaaaaaaait.
still kinda vanilla compared to the chad grappler
10 of them. with a blowgun
and she has sleep darts
oh
and she swings three times a round
so a crit from her with all her stuff would be 5d8+2d6+5
and that's on top of possibly criting with hunters mark and colossus slayer on
and since shes a half orc, her crits do more damage
i upgraded the axes to crit more often
the ranger is kinda cool
even though the warmage is very close to a "you missed" character
i don't think "you missed" the character would be fun
then i remembered kevin say make enemies that would be fun to fight or just interesting
and 53 hp
before, the war mage was a forge cleric with an ac of 22
not really
man all my stuff looks tryhard
pallys are just strong
and i have a basic vengeance pally....
a war magic wizard that has a bunch of "fuck you no" spells
i have a half orc strength ranger
and i got popeye orc
i just looked up grappler dnd
compared to your build mine are vanilla :/
actually I like this one more
you have the restraining feat?
that's kinda toxic
N I C E
bear totem?
storm herald?
what kind of barb would do that?
did you make the npc for the tourney yet?
reckon its too late for it this week
I ened up leaving idk if you still wanted to play today
its been a little while
too many fingers in too many pies
right im in too deep
hes like
should i tell jett that?
how supremely distressing
because once i started getting involved again eric lost his mind
i should just recuse myself from this again
dreadful
how
not what ive been told by milo
the houses move against me
how conspiratorial
in spite of what milo told me
but apparently if I refer to it im told that no one agrees
well... no new information was brought to my attention with that statement
nice
I am currently being told by eric that im a big liar and I should kill myself
she wants to borrow it
borrow
lol
and that tilted him
we talked about what you guys talked to me about
was in call with milo, miles, and him
i may have tilted eric by asking too many questions again
wrooong move
I first saw examina when it was in early access. a youtuber called jerma985 played it and naturally it was fucking difficult to watch this paraplegic idiot move
and hell to play
I feel like its a fun game to watch
truly virile
and a Germanic fridgeframe body to match
he does have that fat lesbian face that's the envy of all men
honestly idk how you managed to get general sam from that description
I miss his hunt showdown stuff....
correct
my favorite fat jewish lesbian youtuber just did a video on it
yes
Art of war is a lot more drumming
Or maybe not
Tf2 song
Tf2 song
Reminds me of art of war
I could duck game
want to do one?
s?
wa?
are you playing with the boys?
nice
its too late now. ive already moved on
how supremely depressing
your silence is deafening
but I think you said youre good for yours
I think kev said no because hes moving
are we playing dnd over the 3day weekend?
are we playing dnd over the 3day weekend?
you have to remind me since im pretty sure we said something last week
and its funny that you say mordhau is gay since the only person who still makes mordhau content that I watch has very... interesting thumbnails
fun as fuck on release and then it became terrible
it had a chivalry life cycle
it had its time and now only the autistic spergs that know how to game the system still play it
don't buy it
games dead
you ready?
i guess that means they really liked it
well
well
what did they say?
what did the other guys talk about?
idk if anyone else said anything about that
i noticed that i forgot to say it last time
your players should tell you if their pc is bored or excited or whatever
dont say: you feel ....
oh heres something else you shouldnt do
k
…. is he the knife lady...
also is Jonah just not a thing anymore?
back implies later in the day
you mean forward
(puke)
I noticed the cleric wouldn't give up
wonder if they'll say the same thing
wonder if they'll say the same thing
did you ask the others?
make those npcs do something
if your party isn't making moves to move it along
and talking with the goliath
talking with the prisoner
heres where I think it took too long
too much
too long
and the game lasted 5 hours
some parts dragged too long
want my honest opinion?
Able
But 3-4 I think is accept
I don’t think you should play with less than 3 players
K in a sec
I just think if you want to have everyone for 1st game you’ll be waiting for more than a week
Or dm him with an explanation of what he missed
Use it again later
Being down 1 or 2 is expected
Youll never have a full group as were 6 people
It’s likely that from here on out
I don’t think you should kick but I don’t think you should be afraid of doing session one without everyone
Then it’s just me and Jonah
And then you lose Kyle, who brought the two
If you kick Devin you run the risk of losing his friend
K
That’s how you responded last time
Also what did you want me to see?
Wasn’t dev the reason why we’re starting late?
They’re magic or something
No I had dark knights and holy knights
Horsepower for maximum skirmish potential
H o r s e
It was greaaaat
I stayed up til 1 finishing blue lions route by putting everyone on a horse
Something you wanted me to see?
But now I am
I wasnt
Well
Dw it’ll be fine
K
Theater of the mind this shit it’ll be fine
Are you not ready for tomorrow then?
Or you could just port out to a shrine
Lol
Eventually
And the bombs stop
It was a good chest
Ifan or gtfo
or you gonna take care of it
want to give me a bit of info on how the gang gets together so I can write an in for that
got it
harry potter in his uncle's place situation
k
I like him
heads or tails mars
i made it important to know your relationship with your dad
idk if its something you want to use
ill let you decide that
i didnt think of my relationship w/ horace
so no questions then?
i was also thinking divination wizard
its fucking awful
i just hate sorcs tiny spell list
since the backstory is flexible enough to accomodate for multiple classes
then make the final decision
but fr ill wait until friday, listen to everyone else
so divine soul sorc is the only way i can be psuedo religious while also being magic
clerics and pallys are literally not allowed to have those without not being clerics and pallys anymore
but then i was like... i want crisis of faith as my character flaw
i honestly was gonna make him acleric
unless youre ok with like no you are magic
and kael clearly doesnt... have absolute faith
but the issue is that clerics get their powers from beliving in their god
and im honestly thinking about doing that
i could revamp to light cleric if it makes more sense
divine soul sorc
im not a cleric
im uhh
like a reason for a call to action sort of thing
or if youd like me to make any sort of amendment to make it easier to have the party come together
tell me if theres anything youd like clarified
Kael was born to the peculiar coupling of an elf preacher from Thrane and a human tribeswoman in the Eldeen Reaches. Kane, Kael’s father, traveled to the reaches in an attempt to convert those he came across to the following of the Silver Flame. His conviction and zeal in his beliefs caught the eye of one native woman, Freya, and the woman took an interest in the elf. She didn’t have any intention of converting from her druidic faith, the children of winter, but instead thought that such an impassioned man would help her bear powerful children. Such was the way of her sect. When Kael was born alongside his two brothers, Khal and Karn, he was the smallest of the babes. After 5 years, the disparity between Kael and his two brothers grew even more. Freya thought that the boy was more elf than man and wouldn’t grow to be a valuable member of her sect. In accordance with the customs of her tribe, was preparing to abandon the child in the forest. Kane was staunchly against leaving his youngest son to die and resolved to return to Thrane with the child. Once Kael arrived in Flamekeep, Kane’s hometown and Thrane’s capital city, he was put in the care of a minister of the Silver Flame while his father set out again to the Eldeen Reaches to spread his faith once again. 17 years had past and Kael hadn’t heard any news pertaining to his father, mother, or brothers.
Since he was born, Kael’s life had been laid out on a track before him. Forced from his place of birth by his mother and forced again into a life serving the clergy of Thrane by his father, Kael feels that he has never had an opportunity to make a decision for himself. While growing up in the presence of staunch believers of the Silver Flame, Kael also found himself keeping to the faith. However, lingering doubt plagues him as he works for Horace Mais, the minister his father left him with when he was 5 years old. One’s faith should be a decision made by himself alone, or so Kael believes. But, for some time now, Kael had wondered if he believes in the Silver Flame’s justice because he decided to commit himself to it or because it was another life-shaping choice people like Horace, Kane, and Freya had forced on him. If the Silver Flame embodies justice for all, then is he being served justice by being abandoned by his entire family and being made to serve a deity that may or may not even keep him close to its heart? Kael longs to take charge of his own fate, but cant bring himself to take hold of his life. Despite his doubts, still he serves.


We’re lvl... what
Apparently everyone wants to be a fighter or Druid or some shit
Also what do these people want to play
You still good for tonight at 7 tho?
And the heavy prevalence of shapeshifters 
Not the robots
Poggies 
Oh turbo weebs?
Is a mess in eberron
Even the religious stuff, the thing in dnd i like the most
It’s a lot
I’m game
Sure
But I think it’s just me being unfamiliar 
I’m not the biggest fan of eberron
Fine
K
Mmmm
I mean if they don’t respond then I just won’t do it
Yeah
Ik Milo saw it but he didn’t respond 
So I asked once
I don’t want to chase them
Doubt it’s happening tbh
Zip
milo and jett haven't said anything
do whatever
cool
so youre good for about 7 tonight right?
so at 6:30 7ish
we kinda have to start early since milo has a morning shift on saturday
what time are you good for?
havent heard from milo
jett said he should be good unless something comes up by the end of today
we can work out a time when i hear from everybody
since eric is out of town I think
I wanted to ask if youre good to do my game on Friday this week
dr manhattan got a paintjob
the golden man is basically a giant Oscar
probably made to eat them or smth. feel like that would trigger something
and finds out she can control bugs n shit
and the main character is a girl who gets bullied
and people who had triggering events in their lives are magic
a golden man flashed his peepee to the world in the 80s
but I did read some setting stuff
I haven't started reading
if you say so
florida?
also is worm only text. I was under the impression that it was a web comic before I clicked it
as you've said nothing about it since then
im assuming whatever the fuck you were going on about a few days ago isn't as big a deal as you made it out to be
yeah do that
do you remember how to make your pc?
I remember you saying it wasn't anymore
mars is your schedule on Saturdays still dumb
i doubt it
and other things
and shot
I hope you like getting stabbed
well
yet
at least they aren't winter wolves
but dogs = wolf
well... their wolves actually
but if you get higher level
they have the statblocks of dire wolves right now
mmm no
the dogs will love to kill you though
yes
and he uses dogs
but hes ready and made
well not yet
he uses dogs
that's assuming the bounty hunter I made just for you doesn't find and merc you first
for good
banish your ass back to eberron
heyyyyyyyyy guess what an arcana cleric can do
assuming an agent of mordenkainen doesn't planeshift your ass back to eberron permanently
thats enough to get the fucking commissioner to come down from on high to make sure youre ass is dead
but a fucking changeling?
or jack the prices
and shopowners will either not let you in
then they'll just hate you
if you were a kobold boy id be like... people are gonna mistrust you on sight, guards are gonna harass you until they remember your face
people are TERRIFIED of doppelgangers
orc is probably a maim at least
kobolds and goblins are like... pathetic enough that that a couple guards would try to catch you
no heres the thing
instead of STAB STAB STAB
and think of what to do with you
put a collar on you, throw you in a cell
if youre in one of the more tolerant places in the world
the guards might just catch you
even if youre a monsterous race, unless youre actively threatening someone
probably leaning 1 since hes not trying to maul someone
or a druid of some sort
a were creature
theyd think hes either a cursed human
nor would most of the common folk
by the by mars your character wouldn't know what a tabaxi is
to Baldur's gate
move the setting from a demon-infested forest
but hey
the boss was a werebear
but i never got to use the werewolves and weretigers
that was that
do you remember one of the gangs i had in the forest campaign was like knolls and giant lizards and worgs n stuff
of were things
made up entirely
you guys are fighting a gang in a city
if we get far into the game
but not a player race
i mean wererats do
rat people don't exist in 5e
fucking love skaven
fucking love skaven
if skaven aren't on the table im not playing some fuzzy bastard
sorry
people thought id be the first
fuckin furry
milo is a kitty man
yes
STAB HIM
then ill fuckin
immune to opportunity attacks
rogues can disengage as a way to get in
eric thinks hes clever making the polearm master sentinel build
i cant have some happyface looking motherfucker walk into my bandit camp and steal the macguffin
and they have things they need to get done
but my bad guys are
but I swear you are going to be the biggest headache to deal with
or when I get the chance to make another session
don't know if I get to keep you guys as my players
this will get annoying
wait fuck you can change your height
cant become a 10 year old
cant change your height
if that's what youre saying
but you cant shift into a dog
well yeah to that
no sir
no shifting into the captain of the guard unless you've seen the fucker
and you can only shapeshift into someone you've seen before
it doesn't change your clothes btw
nd you need to use it
waiting for the situation where its make or break
until you use your unsettling visage
I mean I pretty much told jett that youre a type of monster
did you tell them?
do they know what you are btw
ill just do it
I don't need to tell you what would happen to you if you dont
you will stop
but if its annoying to them
I don't care. it will be annoying for me
will
you
if jett and milo say its annoying
did you make a name
ill ask you to stop
if other players find that disruptive
that sort of thing
what kind of kid is he? has he had any formative experiences in his outings from the house? what did he do all that time indoors?
develop the kids character
when you get a chance
your dad is wealthy. he lives in a major city. hes a monster. youre a monster. he sheltered you from the world because hes afraid of what would happen to you.
ok. so heres what i have
jesus that's exactly what you did
but im assuming the first thing you wrote to him wasn't: my character is named roman, he comes from a family of monster hunters, and hes a strange tamer
he didn't take everything you wrote word for word did he?
do that
then what did you do for roman?
you just rattled off a bunch of quirks?
is this how you did roman's backstory with kevin?
dm being me
and let the dm handle the rest
and your relationship with your dad
just tell me about your kid
let me handle that
trust me
are fucking commoners
most npcs, unless theyre monsters
and i don't want to fill my fucking world with a bunch of bullshit npcs
if your dad was badass, he wouldn't need ahnburg
but the whole point of sending you to ahnburg is so that you can have a former badass teacher
he might have some experience barding
hes not a former badass
your dad got planeshifted by accident 
yeah no.
and if one finds you before your party is lvl 7, youre dead
unless an agent of mordenkainen finds you
so shit like greyholm and eberron will literally never come up
and i really don't want to bring up planes
and that's a big reason why your dad is in serious shit
your dad does
you the kid don't know about the planeshift
write about the kid.
k.
do it on your own time
im aware
and tell me about what your dad does and what your kid does. because you didn't really tell me anything about him
polish this shit up
so again
hes got a whole ass mansion in there
mordenkainen would drop a fireball on your ass from his demiplane
because if they did
for your sake rn the people who want your dad dead don't even know you exist
this shit would be for people of a higher level
youre level one
fucking with mordenkainen's crew is not a good idea
you want the interstellar space police to want you dead too?
so not only do you want all the locals to hate you for being a monster
the forgotten realms have dopplegangers
also changelings are an eberron thing
so.... do you want me to make it up?
he didn't get wealthy off of being a jester
what does he do?
or how he operates in the city
you didn't really tell me how your father became wealthy despite being a monster
ok so youre going to have to refine all of that and send it to me in a more organized way
and its not for nothing
there is a reason people are afraid of them
but if this goes longer than 1 session, im going to make your changeling regret being born if you aren't extremely careful about this
i honestly don't know how many times im going to be able to play this game
dead
you
want
will
people
but understand that if people find out youre a changeling
ill let you make a changeling
oh Christ
does this person function as a human being?
what is this twice a year thing
what
fucking
are you talking about the kid or the dad
i really don't and im waiting for you to tell me
waterdeep is closer to daggerford
you should pick one because they are very different cities
what?
love how people cant tell me directly and I just have to wait and see
It really doesn't matter
yeah
or just in general
idk if he meant this friday
its probably just 3 of you rn
then never said anything else
because milo said he didn't want to but he told me he was gonna think about it
also did miles tell you he didn't want to play?
hit me
I need them before friday
do you have an idea for your backstory
or a barbarian
but he will definitely be a fighter
shit he can be both at different time periods
he might be a cavalier or a samurai depending on what I want
and so is indomitable
legendary resistances are a thing
he might be a fighter but hes still a bbeg
but that's just my initial thoughts
more like a fighter on a horse with a sabre leading a charge of a bunch of fighters on horses with sabres
and rn im feeling a genghis khan bbeg
because I don't remember the last time the bbeg was not a wizard or sorc or magic dude in some way
and be ready because most of what I have planned in that regard are subversions
there may be an overarching plot with a bbeg ill introduce later down the line
after that go out in the world and make your story
and it will be for at least 1.5 sessions
but at the start this game is railroaded
so ik you said you didn't like railroaded stuff
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh booooooooooooooy
but know that most of what the whispers bard does is supernaturally scare people by saying some really fucked up stuff
there isn't really a better bard for that
and remember that you are to play a goodboy
and I assume theres going to be something in your backstory that would make your character inclined to being the most dangerous murder bard in the game
so youre not really playing a college of anything bard rn
youre level 1
so um
or I might have to slap those titties if you know what im saying
also read the damn thing before you hit me with caps lock sir
still would rather wear the button up and slacks
while your protagonists wear traditional Japanese kimonos
making your villain wear western style of dress
thank you japan
and the main villain looks like Michael Jackson singing billy jean
did you read what I said?
I didn't cancel anything
if not then its for later
if we play this Friday then I have it ready
I have my game
no
but if eric continues do you want me to compete for a time with him?
im making the first one
so does the boar guy
also he screams alot
also the bananaman is more cheddar than banana
caps?
ill tell you what id like you to change
if I cant
when you come up with your backstory send it to me so I can see if I can work with it
not racist btw
on mine it says Chinese but with extra steps
on mine it says Chinese but with extra steps
on my skype yours is Token
then tell me mine
tell me tell me tell me
oh?
its akin to a cry for attention. if he legitimately believes these things, he has huuuuuuuge problems
dont talk to him when hes like this
without sugar
that's like diet flaming
as if him being there stopped me
heeeeeeeeeeeeeell yeahhhhhhh
sin eric
Lank, hero of highroole
so I just made link and called him Lank
im pretty sure this is a meme game since jett's character is named zoomer boomer
and when I am able, I will attain honor through the bushido code as a samurai
I am now a archy boy
so after the change to rolls and my statline being mal-adapted
you honor your clan.
because the glory of nippon is far reaching
its dumb
i was also thinking dex samurai. did you know all the samurai's bullshit can be used on ranged weapons too?
and If its a squishy mage: tripping attack action surge STAB STAB STAB
disarming attack
disarming attack
disarming attack
I get to start doing dumb things at lvl 3
its ok. it needs you to be 6 to cash in on that charis to damage
I saw that video sir
it doesn't matter that you have a fancy weapon if you cant keep a grip on it
yall ready for the battlemaster dex fighter?
if we reset im making a fighter designed to beat the fuck out of humanoids
and I hate them
second is the homebrew items and creatures.... theyre gay
are the fucking npcs
the worst part of erics games
idgaf what anyone has to say
stop asking questions
DEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
LIGHT
=
FIRE
yep
its the BURN HERETIC cleric
light is a more angry cleric than milo is playing
id do the martin luther reformation thing I kept telling milo to do
I legit think I can do a better job as her than any of you
scaled way the fuck down
I think the world needs to be scaled down
but im checked the fuck out
im still in this game
can I be honest?
whatever dude
hes like: if you don't like your rune just take someone elses
lol
while jett gets everything
eric is trying to justify why miles gets 1 role with advantage
fuck them
whose that?
enjoy that info. that's in character
and maybe some corpses
fire
and so when he went there he used necromancy to help push the front lines into his town and burned it down
my character was in the army
yes. they rebelled against the duke's rule
for whom he destroyed his hometown when they rebelled
and wants the best for this city's citizens
my character is supposed to be someone who flies in the face of the rules and is uncompromising with justice
it doesn't mean tearing down the church
miles just wants to kill this lady
I hate this setting so fucking much man
no he said hed literally not let it happen
this is shitty
what
EXCEPT DEPOSE THE CHURCH
eric literally told me we're allowed to do whatever we wanted
dumb
dumb
fucking
thats
everyone is lvl 5-9
than a world where while we're stronger
id rather have a world in which every noble was a lvl 1-5 wizard
erics setting is dumb
its fucking dumb
why the fuck is everyone able to throw fireballs and lightning bolts
most people aren't even level 1
lvl 7 is powerful
lvl 7 is not shitty
if theres a lvl 20 npc who can invalidate anything and everything I do
why play?
whats the point?
fucking what?
just do other things
eric defended it by saying: you don't have to mess with my powertrip character
dumb
thats
that spell literally outleveled me
because then I wouldn't have to deal with being hit by a fucking 8th lvl spell at lvl 7
if she was lvl 10 I wouldn't be fucking upset
and not on the assassin attempting to murder willaim
but only when she needs to cast spells on players
why is the archbishop a lvl 20 cleric
that dumb
but players are bound to rules and shit
but fr why do npcs get to ignore rules and make shit up
and I expect everyone to talk about how good it tastes
I hope he crams all manner of bullshit down our throats
also if im not allowed to question eric on whatever he does
literally none of the others are worth thinking about
and champion
eldritch knight
battle master
only 3 matter
they share their action surge with all party members
that actually exists
more like banneret fighter subclass
i guess that's cool
but instead i get to take double damage and have a giant glowing hit me sign up to 200 feet away
including my skellingtons
it would be activating it to give all my allies a single action to make a single weapon attack on my turn
but i did have an idea that i liked a lot and i was going to pitch it to eric but he already came up with my garbage rune
since im a crybaby who cant be trusted to stick with something
im not allowed to have nice things remember?
with arcane recovery, that goes to 20
that's not including my arcane recovery
at lvl 7
i can, over the course of 3 long rests, have 16
i told milo im actually done with this bullshit and am amassing my skeleton army
no
what?
for what?
I want my skeleton army.
this is dumb
yeah no
mine is literally the worst
nvm
ok
so he gets a better shield spell
whats jetts
he doesn't care about balance anymore he just gives you and milo dumb shit
fuck this
ok
its passive?
or you turn it on and its for 1 attack
is that 30% lifesteal passive
just asking
whats jetts
which is why ive not received a magic item in 3 of his campaigns
i already know he has a distaste for giving me stuff
i never asked
nop
that's not how id do it
eric shows his favorite
and... miles gets advantage i guess
mine lets me take bonus damage
yours and milos are dumb
runes weren't made equally
yeah that's retarded
so let me explain why i have a hard time with this game
did you know you can proc sneak attack again
that breaks class balance in favor or martial classes
it means you get to exploit his stupid counter system
but now i hate this city he built and how it doesn't conform with what i know
that's what he told me
but now people are throwing out major images like theyre candy
i can hack it if minor illusion is ubiquitous
i didn't know that apparently most people are lvl 5-9 wizards
until today
I do base it off that
also level 7 is big
so I have seen
enjoy this
the more i will
and toward normal adventuring style dnd
so the more i get to push it away from that
I don't like this excel spreadsheet management sim
like normal dnd
when we were fucking about outside it
was when we weren't in this city
which is why my favorite parts of the game
i still hate his magic items
i still hate his npcs
I still have problems with erics game
k
grow up pussy
uhh
but if you cant
because im pretty sure you can take it
im not toxic like this in the other game
get used to it
I am super toxic all the time
3
die
2
lvl 7 is big in a normal setting
1
and it said to stay
i flipped a coin
he said yes
I asked eric if he wanted me to stay
I flipped a coin and it landed on what I said I would play again for
as if me saying anything stopped you guys from wanting to do dumb stuff
might as well happen sooner than later
I felt like it was a long time coming
because of the problems i had with it and how he wanted things to go
i left erics game
or we do without mars
which wont happen
so im gonna tell them that youll probably arrive at 10, which means either we start super late
i thought you said you were done with Saturday shifts
yeah I don't think thatll fly
when?
are you playing tonight?
they happen and you hack it or you drop out
you don't sign up for when finals happen
you don't sign up for when finals happen
it makes me want to DIE
i love the quarter system
also expect me to be violent and irritable in about 2 weeks because that's when finals roll around
thanks for asking
im doing fine
but anyways
god damn that man cannot hold his pizza
but god damn
but also my friend
milo is dumb
i mean
i don't mean it
second of all
pussy
first of all
if I say something that hurts you
but this is a game
I still think milo is dumb and I don't like it when people tell me to not talk
trust me don't take anything personally
so me being pissy and complaining about everything is normal
you don't know me as long as the other guys know me
but I still legitimately think that what milo was doing was dumb
im doing fine. midterm stress is gone
uh good talk
mhmmm
whyre you asking
i finished all my midterms this wednesday so thats good
umm still alive?
?
Are you still at work?
Afk
that's about plants and animals and being nice to nature
doenst help that hes living in a church that belongs to a nature domain god
but when he slept on it it ate at him and he feels guilty
the justification I had when I did it was that he couldn't afford to fuck up the fight so he wanted to take every advantage he could get even if it was next to nothing
well he isn't
im not retconning im just going back to that
I don't think him killing the dog was in character btw so im going to do something about that at the start of next game
a manbaby with the power to eat your soul
also hes been alone since he was 16 so he never actually aged past that point and is kinda a manbaby
he acts out and is loud and annoying to distract himself from something he did that traumatized him
just let me say this about why he acts like he does
did she say that after I left?
do you want backstory I think it would be something that might clear that up
I don't remember
also noone liked the death monk in character or out?
you can try lol
I can get way with ANYTHING
and the sad fact is
I had such a handle on the situation I know what I can and cant get away with
in case you forgot
eric is afraid of killing pcs
How far out from home?
You need to take a train to get home?
where are you rn?
should i start sleeping with deathward?
k
just asking
how old is roman?
Is it just me or is every fucking antagonist we see is being enabled by someone whose missing a few chromosomes 
do the whispers show up?
enjoy
speaking of which... your greenhouse now counts as difficult terrain
i can do that
but yeah if you want your plants to grow out of control or some guys house to grow spikes n shit
and like any true writer, i stole it from somewhere else
i did
no
get those godly goodboy points
so basically if i see a shrine to another deity im gonna stoneshape that fucker into a mess
but apparently its heavily tied to nature since it turns flesh to bark and breaks down stone into strange shapes
i am chaos aligned 
the machinations of the miracle are inscrutable, impossible to decipher any rhyme or reason to
the fuck would i know. as far as im aware its formless and random
and he wears a brass mask depicting the first son of the miracle when walking around town because... idk darkies aren't allowed?
so my pcs face is really fucked up and most of it is scarred bark
sometimes people are born with bark instead of flesh in certain parts of their body. these people are called the sons and daughters of the miracle
when its a bad thing people call it the grievous miracle but theyre one and the same
when its a good thing people exalt it as the divine miracle
when the miracle influences something, someone usually ends up dead or petrified into a tree
when it affects the material plane it does so by twisting stone into jagged broken shapes and turns flesh to bark and trees
ok so its name is The Divine Miracle. it doesn't have a face or a personality that i know about and acts as a random force of mutation and change
do you want a rundown of his god?
i don't know if you will like the cleric
hes not my character anymore
you can go have tea with him or smth
as a hireling
the bard still exists
fighter still best boys tho
tbh cleric was always one of my favorite classes. love me some religious zeal
whyre you asking?
imma tell on you
talking shit?
and 52 hp
and heavy armor
i have debuffs
ik we already have a cleric but milo kinda buffs or uses fireball
i am
yes
so im taking up as a off-tank
and a blaster
and we already have a support
I am not juggling two characters
so that's what I am
I like cleric more than I like druid
eric asked if id rather be a nature cleric instead
i don't think i should keep both because it didn't work last time i had two pcs
eric asked me if the druid was a permanent replacement for the bard. I told him that I only made the bard because the party is asking me to do something the bard would literally not do
its a slow and painful death my brother
thought you were dying from lumbago
howd you manage that?
adam jenson taught me
DEUS EX
?
where'd he learn that
all of you
w o r t h l e s s
the fuck?
He is dead. Now he's useless.
it would go like this:
none of the praise apone is giving lynn would be reciprocated if he died and I didnt
and chain you with debt forever for it
literally anyone else
don't ask this guy for the rez
im just saying man
apparently not
is that you?
so good luck with that
the monk is a huge asshole
well
I guess it does
theres that
you never brought up how hes literally a self professed spy feeding info on you guys to someone you don't like
well
that seems good enough
so how are you gonna convince the party to not do it?
and in the game don't say "because parsa said not to"
im just asking you what YOU are gonna do
idc. i have another pc already
are you gonna go for the rez or no
yeah
what do you want to do next in the perion game
and don't tell kev i asked this because he told me not to try to influence you guys
for you
i have a question btw
A girl
oh boy
me
guess whos not going to do that
who also packs enough charming magic to give an entire room an epileptic seizure
more like a true neutral passive observer
bard
...
you played pyre
it should be evident
you played that game man
Yep.
yep
because ryan has to be done 3 his time
it is
but you are sunday?
very cool
when do you get off work
tomorrow
are you going to eric's party
saying something then saying forget it is a great way to make me hate you
just shoot
k
greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeat
not an injury
doc
it goes away
needle stick with anesthetic
i cant feel my hands rn
because
wanna call or type
k
should i
...
i just understood it to be based on a weeb dating sim game
no
I haven't played it yet
umm
you even spelled it right
yes
that is my name
think youll be done by 6?
go do that
well nvm
oh
or was that later this week
you said youre in santamonica rn right?
was gonna ask if people wanted to get something to eat
no lunch then
Are you at work?
well... N O T A N Y M O R E
i thought you get to roll first
hoh
how
cteam is ok. I like their pax stuff more tho
not cteam?
Welcome to Acq Inc. We own your internal organs now. You literally signed them away to us.
welp… enjoy giving up 60 percent of your profits and findings. you do get to keep magic items tho. good for you. but you do have a quota.
and as expected none of you tried to haggle and get a better deal. but then again none of you passed that int check
but I cut that and had you do that with omin instead
there was one more room where you would attempt to negotiate a contract with an angry golem
what was mine was the mosaic room and the convo with omin and iago.
the things that were the modules were the catchphrase room, treasure room, pit room, and entrance.
the mosaic wasn't a thing in the module
brand
that
protect
very on brand
are you home?
id take archery
fireball
also yes
:///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// id take archery
... youre lvl 4 looking toward lvl 8?
im bumrushing 20 int. i took a feat that gave me int because i was at 17
its more important
which brings me to this point. dont take that feat. just get the dex
he explicitly said no
also he said no
you are correct
if you werent already 20 dex, how the fuck are you now
i dont think weapon mastery gives you any stat upgrades
you either get 2, 1/1, or a feat
you know were not doing points like eric right
whats your dex
because 10 percent chance to hit is better
but understand that i did something very similar for lynn. and i took archery
idk about rogue since having two attacks blah blah blah sneak attack blah blah blah
noone else
and rangers
but keep in mind the math was done with the idea that the classes that get fighting styles are paladins and fighters
the ones that are the best as far as damage output goes is dueling and archery
listen someone did the math for the fighting styles
correct
and thats good
yes
and archery is the best for someone whose... not
i personally think dueling is the best for melee
archery is literally a plus 10 percent chance to hit
twf is garbage
why
ok
oi josuke
I don't have time for you sorry
i am dealing with at&amp;t right now
so its just the pic of the emperor that is my skype profile
ok so it doesn't work
its kruber
do you like kruber from vermintide 2?
or do you not care?
do you want us to give you a pilot picture?
how do I do that
and you want me to send you my character sheet?
k
mars the talent is called heavy gunner
are we game today btw?
sure....
no you have a wizard
you could just realign your character before the game starts...
which means he either dies in one hit or milo just never attacks him
i mean this isn't a serious game. Michael has an 8 in all his physical stats because he wanted to
so... I don't get it
?
are you a pally or a fighter/
… ok
then... do that?
is that how your character looks like in your head? I mean the pic I have for my character isn't what I had in mind. doenst have a widowspeak like I drew
I did
idk could be fun
l a z y
were you going to sketch your thing?
That or celestial warlock
Because I want to ruin everything for everyone
I’m doing wild magic sorc
It’s fair and balanced and a bullshit way to get smites back on short rest
Go hex blade forgo strength just put your points into charis
Warlock pally is a staple bullshit combo
albeit he was shitfaced at his party
pretty sure he was just saying he would make one
never said
this being the 3rd time its a thing?
did you say you were going to play milo's game?
are you working today?
mars does your new schedule impact sunday or no
get on
ready
Called winter is trumping
My favorite got meme is still the Donald trump one from 3 years ago
I found this before you sent it to me
which is lame
I am a bit tilted that we got cancelled 2 hours before we start
well it looks like kevin isn't answering
lol
character creation
umm... how bout cc?
do you... know how to?
like what
..
do you still want to do something tonight?
so
Id rather not
being unpredictable about when we start is shitty
yeahhhhhhhhhh
a Saturday thing then?
judging from what you just sent
and it probably will be ready for then
I mean... I am writing something
but it will cost you
i have an idea on how to make you get spells
welcome to wizard
you have to find them
no
mars you prep your wizard lvl plus int mod
so i prepped the others
you only prepped 3
and you have 6 prepped spells
the vision in your backstory is your stuped portents
mars you dink
you can decide to spend it on crap before we start so if you wanted to get a thing like spell components or whatever the fuck you can do that before the game
you have 10 gold on your person from your backstory right?
im just looking through what you've got
alix needs to pick items
kevin is done
which is why im looking through everyones stuff
rogues and bards are the ones that start with more than 2
yes
wizard gives you a choice of 2
mars
where do they come from
how do you have more proficiencies than the rogue
mars
ok
if you don't have your spells chosen im making you play without them for the first session
and im telling you this rn
whats the name Dott calls you by
ok so amais is your open name
if I need the others ill ask
only the mommy matters
caretaker*
and the name of your caretakers
definitely put your real name in bonds
but under ideals and bonds fill stuff in
just put what you want in and put the name you want to show players in as well
so the name she called you is niam?
nothing else matters since I have the general gist of your story
like... today
but fr I need that name and token asap
Ill do that tomorrow the store is closed
actually no
im going out to buy milk
so when you get back call me
itll be me telling you what parts I want specifics in
no
ok
ill be up all night tonight doing shit
can I do this now or later?
ok because I want to be in call with you so I can adequately explain what I need from you
are you doing something rn?
that's... not enough
come to me when you have the damn thing ready
no you git
youre just there rn
you don't have to be from byss
and youre in byss
and you are currently in dire straights for money
make a character with some sort of trauma or tragedy they still feel
I already gave you the guidelines right?
sure
something bad happened in your life
fuck you kevin did it and I like what he made
ill want those bonds and ideals filled out too
I need to be able to write something tonight
mars you git just make your damn character
well I hope you realize the only premonitions you'll be getting will be of you being fucking evicerated
fucking divination
goddambit all you did was pick divination and fuck off
did you finish your character?
idc
idc
idk
or they might not
those languages might come in handy
its probably fine
all of you
if you remember what that is in kevins world its the island that went to shit
also mars youre from byss
go fuck yourself you portent piece of shit
also divination wizard?
something like that
he might owe money to the wrong people
tell me why
atm your character is strapped for cash
also mars
and you got your add code. join in and roll your stats
I need it well before sunday mang
when you can
and they understand how it works. you cant walk up to a townie and use dancing lights and declare yourself a god
people know what magic is
i think my favorite one is the arbalist
honestly if you need inspiration look at those comics that were put out by the darkest dungeon devs
and i need real tragedy or trauma to do what i want
im letting you know that i cant do all i want to do with the first session or any following ones if you dont give me a backstory i can work with
I donno what happens next
looks like our scheduling went fucky
is the next game?
idk
well
umm
or wednesday
don't we rotate Monday?
its not realized yet
idk yet
we'll see
get apolinario  to overstep his bounds by implicating him in the murder of a council member
platt has a bottle of his own family wine along with a signed letter from him
after we kill krihili, i will start tagging buildings in the city with anti-magia rhetoric
then platt is later found dead, poisoned seemingly by a bottle of magia wine with a note from A.
hey how do you like this plan
I donno
they totally will
I mean
:/
I did
just server mute you nitwit
welp see you later
damb
mars left the conversation
we'll see
fuck no
the next guy will actually have some heroic qualities
idk.
all that time just for... nah?
a fighting style goes a long way
which is actually way better than people give it credit for
or a lvl in fighter
like being a drow
just find a way to get prof
rapier...
its got the fucking word in their name
you know there is a monk subclass that's fucking designed to be interested in death right?
god damn it not this again
why cant you come up with something cool like a spell breaker mage?
weeb
best ricardo by far is the bladerunner ricardo meme
did you not like the ricardo juice and holy water meme?
no sharing
ricardo is mine
no
i think he wants it to happen, but after then we become a loose end
i feel like the call to make us the people to do the work seems like its a setup
idk
humph
your fucking payoff?
i have to first think what i want to have happen first
oh I will go through with it but I want to do so in a way that gets me what I want
I disagree
you want to go through with it?
what is your plan for the coming sessions?
i like apone rn
but also I don't think so
youre dumb
The sabbat... idk about the sabbat except they’re hardcore
The camarilla is the establishment that thinks older gen kindred closer to Caine are to be worshipped
Anarchs are new generation kindred who got pissed at the establishment 
Or even the fucking sabbat 
Stupid blood stuff for the anarchs or the Camarilla
The fucking promenade could have an underground portion with bloodshit 
Famous places with dark twists
We know la
The thing is the setting can just be... la
Don’t let the bloodbags know that vampires exist
Just understand the basic rules of the masquerade
But the thing is the world of shadows has an asstonne (we metric) of lore
As in I believe there are people who preen themselves the same way as the two characters do
And the other two socialites are probably people that actually exist
The nosfuratu actor was very... good
Geek and sundry
Then again 5e is supposed to be super simplified to be accessible
Then again 5e is supposed to be super simplified to be accessible
I looked into rules n shit and it’s more... complicated than 5e
I wanna make a tremere blood wizard because that sounds metal as F U C K
Also have you heard of the vampire the masquerade tabletop game?
I don’t do well with loud sudden noises
I got spooked from the sloth jump scare in 7
I don’t like horror or suspense thrillers
I just know the plot and relevant theme
But tbh I didn’t see get out either
Getting strangled when you’re young doesn’t give you the voice of a 30 year long chain smoker
I’ve not seen it but I do know what it’s about and I know the twist with the whole she was the faker thing
ill wait until October and people get reviews out and I can see how good reception was
I liked it
watch
did you see the trailer?
and now for the joker movie
I was way more interested in shazam
i didn't really care about it
the clown tried to smear poo on a security guard
let me guess
its greaaaaaaaaaaat
they are haughty, often depicted as xenophobic, and have enormous egos. they are my perfect go to. i like to rag on them the same way weebs rag on other weebs for being weebs
I only have a head rn
I did say I was drawing the next character 
Go towards 3rd street
I think you’re going the wrong way
5 min
2 miles
I’m close
what do you need for that?
ill hit the road in an hour or something
let me know when youre sure
address?
When are you free today?
and also miles is hardcore nolife spamming sekiro
i would ask milo and miles but they still have school
i don't have a car in sb
the first time I drove in 3 months was yesterday
I mean I don't need to
but he doesn't really need to
I donno
but jett does
they don't have their licenses?
ive had my license for over 2 years
just let me know when i should start driving
do you know when youre done at work on Thursday?
TERRIBLE
troy was 2004 and that was fucking
i mean
its older than we are man
well yeah its a pretty old movie
I could come and pick you up from work or something
any time works for me
so on Thursday do you want to see seven 
its not a brad pitt is the big boy hero
but from what ive read
i havent seen it
pffffffffffffft
ok we should watch 7
with brad pitt and morgan freeman
EEEEEEEEZZZZZZZ
how about Seven?
my favorite movie of all time
?
have you ever seen The Usual Suspects
i could rent or netflix something
honestly we dont actually have to go out to amc or anything if we just want to see a movie
and i wont pretend to understand it
i did see it
crime drama
2 words
except shazam. i want to see that
god i fucking want this superhero crap to die
and then theres superhero bullshit captain marvel
it is a horror movie if youre into it
ive heard good things about US
ok do you want to see a movie then or what?
idk
did you still want to hang out on thursday?
did you forget or did something come up?
when you are give me a call
ok
you ready?
ok im home
ok im home
Also I’m not home atm so give me a bit to get there 
As players take their roles?
when do you want to start writing?
also space asshole is a good song
then our scripted events
lets first make our castle and roles
we don't have enough people to pull that kind of crap
umm
umm
we will start writing this fucking fiasco
so tomorrow when we would be playing dnd
so I wont
sseth told me not to
then we're done
then make scripted events
then make roles
but first we have to write the castle space
oh yeah
but early on they wouldn't have any reason to do something crazy like spike the cook's stew with paralysis toxin
oh yeah the pcs can do whatever
you dig?
with each hour any living npc would take an action that has an effect in a particular part in the castle
so that's why its a oneshot that catalogues events that last 24 hours
they might understand the nightmare
but when their local physician gives them medicines that cause them to think their friend is a giant spider that is trying to eat them
they wouldn't have any reason to
because of something an npc did earlier
they discover the doors are barricaded
and when things get wild with demonic invasions and shit
or you could just explain that their pcs wouldn't leave the castle
the pcs probably wont know that shit will hit the fan
but heres the thing
or players could do something that influences the npcs
so like in one end of the village some npc pulls something and will affect the players and other npcs
and events will be scripted to happen every hour
its just a oneshot
I think you understand what I want to have happen
also yes 
When is that happening?
Alright
Hey dude I’m back in SM do you want to hang out?
ive never tried using it
if I made her fight a lvl 4 mastermind rogue as the second fucking encounter I would have killed her then and there
no I just used stock bandits and stock guards from r20

were we going to test something?
are you gonna be home at 8?
dipshit you did
you almost did
but honestly fuck that.
i mean... except the treasure room
and thats the entire damn thing
A sudden bump in the road wakes you from your sleep. It’s been 8 hours on the road and the rain hasn’t let up for the last two days. You groggily wipe your eyes and look around you and outside the flap of the covered wagon you are travelling in. Your companion is with you, also sleepily rousing from his sleep. Please describe yourselves. 
Through the flap of the canvas, you see a muddy road flanked by thick woods on either side. It would be bright outside, but the damn rainclouds block out the sun. You figure it’s about 6 AM based on when you hit the road. You’re a long way from Victus, having been sent out to the countryside by your employer, a doddering old relic collector named Maxus Aurelius. You were sent out to the Eldwood logging village in search for some old musty screenplay that’s supposed to be in some nearby cave. The loggers set up a bar where you’re supposed to meet someone, but you weren’t told who. “You will know him when you see him.”, you were told. You’re getting paid just for looking for the damn thing but the few coins you’ll get wont even compare to the prize he’ll give you if you actually find the damn thing. You have some time to yourselves before you get to the camp. What do you do?
After some time, there is an abrupt stop as the wagon driver stops his horses and gets off the wagon. He opens the canvas door and looks to all of you. 
“Alright folks here’s your stop. Don’t know why yall wanted to leave nice warm Victus for this… place… but that’s your business not mine.”
As you get out of the wagon the rain begins to drench you. As the wagon driver prepares to leave, he looks to you.
“Now remember where you are. These people around here are kinda weird. They keep to themselves and don’t like new folks. Just don’t bother em and you’ll be fine.”
The camp is quite established by the looks of things. There are plenty of large wooden buildings that stand beside the muddy road. People hurry between buildings as they try to get from place to place without being soaked. 
Inside the bar several tables are crowded with burly men sitting amongst themselves speaking in their language. When you enter, several heads turn. Some turn away while others continue to glare, low voices continue to speak. One man sits apart from the others, alone at his table. He sees and motions you to join him. He looks nothing like the other men in the camp, as his light frame and small stature separates him from the others. His thick coat and spectacles still appear to be wet from the rain, his gloved hands wrapped around his tankard.
“I’m sure you’re all eager to get this done and get paid so I’ll get right to it. In the Eldwood there is a cave that supposedly has the artifact Mr. Aurelius wants. This isn’t the first time he’s sent people after it and if you don’t play this smart, it won’t be the last. Locals call the place the Theater of the Mind. Say it’s a nasty place haunted by an even nastier demon. I don’t rightly know or care about their superstitions but what I do know is that some of the people Mr. Aurelius sent don’t come back and the ones who do refuse to go back. Kept saying something about his eyes lying to him or something like that.”
He produces a map from his coat pocket and lays it on the table.
“You are here. The cave is supposed to be right here and is protected by some sort of magic. It won’t hurt you, but it does hide the entrance. Just trust me. This is the place. Follow the path through the forest and you won’t get lost. I’d say you ought to just wait for this rain to clear out, but something tells me the… locals… won’t be very accommodating. Just get this done and shoot me a sending with this.”
He produces a ring from his pocket and places it on the table.
“Single use. Don’t fuckin’ bother with sending me a message saying you failed. If you do you can walk your ass back to Victus. Wagons are for winners. Win, and I’ll send a wagon. Oh, and last thing.”
The man pulls out two scrolls from his pocket.
“Minor illusion is the one with a blue seal. Prestidigitation is the red one. That last guy I was telling you about kept jabbering about how these spells saved his life in there. Didn’t say how and didn’t say when. Up to you to know when the time to use em is. Now, I’m heading back to Victus. Yall have work to do. Get dry, get food, then get to it.”
The hike through the Eldwood forest is a nightmare. The rain and mud make the path slippery and it’s a struggle to not fall. Three hours since leaving the bar, a glance at the map you were given makes you think you’re just over an hour away from your destination. 
Perception Check. Have Audience Pick Who Needs to Make the Check (Who will get surprised if they fail) 3-4 Giant Wolf Spiders
Fail: As you continue along the path, the rain pattering on the ground and leaves around you silence the low rustling in the forest. Without warning, you are suddenly set upon by massive spiders, fangs bared dripping toxic death. Role initiative.
Pass: As you continue along the path, the rain pattering on the ground and leaves around you deafens the low rustling you hear in the forest. Barely in the corner of your eye, you see a massive spider, fangs bared dripping toxic death. Role initiative.
After recuperating from the fight with the giant wolf spiders, you continue towards the marked cave. The hourlong hike is uneventful and you step out of the forest trees, arriving in a clearing facing a steep, stony hill. You have arrived at the marked location on the map. Looking around the area, you see that there doesn’t seem to be any clear cave entrance.
DM Notes: Stoney Hillside is an illusion. Touching the illusion would cause its form to distort and its color to drain from a light grey to a bright translucent pink. Ways to find it are touching the damn thing, investigation check or perception check to see that the hillside doesn’t appear to be drenched in water from the rain.
Stepping through the illusory hillside reveals a darkened cave entrance that goes deeper into the earth. Along the path, luminescent mushrooms light the path. After half an hour of trudging through the cave, you find that the uneven floor becomes more and more level. You see in the floor there is evidence that large amounts of material were moved back and forth within the cave. Wheel tracks and drag marks crisscross the undisturbed dirt ground, which eventually gives way to paved cobblestone. After another few minutes of walking along this paved floor, you see around a corner a cobblestone structure with a large wooden door bathed in shimmering blue light. To the left of the gate, several forgotten building supplies that were seemingly abandoned there lay on the floor or against the stone structure. (Wooden beams, wheelbarrows, hammers, small buckets of nails, and closed wooden crates.) To your left a 30 ft long chasm that leads down into a pool of water separates the cobblestone floored area with the rest of the cave.
DM Notes: The building supplies are illusions. Disrupting them with one’s hand or with a physical object will cause the form of the material to waver and its color to fade into a shimmering pink. The individual will have to take a DC 14 Dex saving throw: 2d6 fire halved on success. 
DM Notes: There is an invisible illusory floor that connects the two ends of the chasm together. Stepping on the seemingly empty area causes a pink stone floor to coalesce into existence, supporting the player’s weight. Have Audience pick who gets the pitfall gag (assuming they cross one at a time. If they cross at the same time, they all get gagged.) DC 20 Dex saving throw, Failed individuals find that the illusory floor disappears out from under them and fall 7 feet before landing on a second illusory floor just under the first, which also leads to the end of the chasm. They take no damage.
DM Notes: The blue light bathing the wooden door prevents any organic material from passing through. Should a rock be tossed at the light, it would go through it and bounce off harmlessly on the wooden door.
As you approach the building, there is a sudden pop, and a figure suddenly appears at your side. 
“Here to try out for the troupe?”
The figure at your side appears to be a court jester wearing decaying red and gold clothing with bells dangling from his hat. On his face he appears to be wearing a porcelain mask stuck in a perpetual manic grin. His rotting clothing reveals freakishly thin frame and pale white skin, tautly gripping his bones.
DM Notes: Writing for the Playwright is difficult as his responses heavily relies on the actions of the players. Try to pester them with jokes and mock them at every turn. This will be his interaction with the players pretty much permanently. Striking the playwright reveals to the players that he too is an illusion, as his form ripples and distorts like the rest of the illusions in the dungeon. 
After crossing the chasm, you find that the cave floor has returned to a more natural, uneven state. Looking forward, you can see that the path appears to be turning towards the right, going deeper into the cave system. Just as you turn the corner, the Playwright appears right in front of you and cries:
“Next Scene! The audiences are bored with seeing the adventurers like you take and take. It’s a tired trope. Let them see you give instead! Give! With Blood!”
Have the party roll intelligence saves. DC: 15 Those who fail see skeletons and zombies. Those who succeed see other adventurers wearing the Playwright’s mask.
Roll initiative: 6-7 Bandit/Guard mix. These undead/living appear to be wearing similar porcelain mask as the playwright, also affixed in the same wild smile. Killing the undead/living creature will cause the illusion to fade away, revealing them to appear like adventurers. If they loot their bodies, they find that 2 of these corpses have a ring like the one they received in the logging camp. 
Along the path after you turned the corner, you find two chests. Perception/Investigation check. The one on the left has a DC 7 trap that appears as a taut string that connects to the chest. It appears that opening the chest would pull on the string, causing a rock tied to the string to fall right in front of the chest. The chest on the right has no detectable trap. 
DM notes: The chest on the right is an illusion that, when disturbed, will explode. DC 14 Dex save 2d6 fire damage halved on success. The chest on the left is real, but the string trap is not. It is an illusion that, when disturbed, bursts. DC 15 Dex save 2d8 lightning damage halved on success. Opening the chest without cutting the string won’t cause the string illusion to trigger. There is a bottle of red, viscous liquid in a clear bottle in the chest. Tied to the neck of the bottle with string is a note that says “Drink Me.” (It is a powerful alcohol)
Leaving the chests behind, you continue into the cave to find another cobblestone structure that is very similar to the one you found earlier in the cave. This structure blocks the entirety of the path and leaves no way to progress save for a pit dropping into a lake and the wooden door leading into the building. Inside, you see an immaculate parlor, complete with fine velvet couches and chairs, tables, and decorations. At the center of the room a 10 ft tall stone statue of a knight saluting stands, facing the entrance you came from. After completely entering the room, the door you stepped through slams shut, and you feel a sudden sense of vertigo. Tables and chairs slide around in the room, as if the entire building was wildly spinning. When the spinning sensation ends, the stone statue turns to face you. 
DM notes: Have the audience choose between 1,2,3, and 4 to determine the correct door. Wrong doors are illusions, DC 15 Dex saves for 2d8 lightning halved on success.
“If you wish to continue to the next scene, you must answer my riddle. I will not reveal the way to dullards. If you fail, good luck trying the doors. I hope you guess well for your own sake, lest you meet a shocking demise.”
Riddle 1: To bear witness to tragedy is to see a confluence of Tribulation, Regret, Anger, Gravity, Emptiness, Drama, and Youth. Where is the ART in tragedy?
Correctly answering the riddle causes the statue to shift and salute towards the correct door. Failing the riddle upsets the statue.
“And how did a dimwit like you even make it this far? That is the true riddle!”
Opening the door reveals a long, featureless hallway that seems to twist and turn in front of your very eyes. Stepping through into the hallway, you feel yourself physically drawn deeper into the stone building. Your mind is swimming with twisting stone and lit torches on the sconces that line the walls. After a few moments you find yourself standing in front of another door. Within the next room, there is a parlor similar to the one you saw before. Stepping into the room, one finds that all the chairs in this room are illusions, but do not burst in explosive magic like the ones you saw before. On the opposite side of the room, there is a door without a handle or keyhole. The door behind you slams shut and lounging on one of the couches lies the Playwright, who suddenly appears in a puff of pink mist. He lazily looks towards you, but suddenly jumps up with excitement.
“You finally made it! Made it to our climactic finale! I had hoped you would get this far! This is my favorite scene! The place I turn my dreams…” 
The entire room briefly glows a bright pink. The door behind you disappears.
“… into reality!”
Roll initiative. Combat gimmick is that illusions are real and real things are illusions. The hope is that players remember the scrolls they were given and use them to conjure illusory weapons with which they can do battle with. Magic, if not an illusion, won’t have any effect on the playwright. If they don’t, the playwright will violently butcher them with an illusory dagger. He is a level 3 pc rogue mastermind. 

Blah blah blah treasure room idc just wing this part you’ll do fine.

i hate writing

it kinda sucks how you and i keep getting the shit kicked out of us
we pretty much did
then oneshotting the barbarian right after
honestly he won us the fight by putting down half their team in one attack
also omegalul didnt lvl up after being butchered by a barbarian
why cant roman just be normal and get out his pent up frustrations with wholesome conspiracy to commit murder?
and ended up sleeping with the dregs
if i remember correctly you 2 botched your charis checks
YOU WOULD LOOK GREAT BY COMPARISON
i mean whos a better wingman than a psycho murderer in a wierd costume
and once he does im sure you would wish he didnt
lynn doesnt exist in your life
well at the moment
I didnt keep exact notes but I think he’s the merchant from another continent 
Also if you remember he’s one of the names we got at the records office
He’s trying to help the city maaaaaaaaan.
Whaaaaaaat? Nooooo.
But there something he did before coming to gradbold as a homeless man
I left out some backstory shit to not spoil it
the end.
And so it goes for the next year.
Rugon smiles and approaches you. "Yes you did. But only from him sadly. There are always others like him who would hurt meaninglessly. Erratically. Uncontrolled. Not like you. You were quick. Efficient. And kind to do so. Many others would have tried to make him hurt. I am glad I trusted you. Will you help me again?"
“did I save the city?”
The man tries to step away quickly but your instinct takes over. With trained speed you grab him by the neck and shove the blade into the eye and twist. The man lets out a startled cry, then gurgles and falls to the ground, leaving you holding your bloody knife in the air.
Lynn takes the knife, looks into the man's face, then at Rugon, then finally at the knife.
The person is looking at you terrified. He strains against his bindings as he tries to get away
"I will be letting him go now. It is not right for him to not be able to say for himself things. To fight. Or to flee. But remember that I trust you to stop him. Dudley, unbind him."
The man is lifted by the goliath, and the ropes are easily sliced off. As the gag is removed he is placed standing on the ground in front of the tree, breathing heavily. He looks at you, and at the knife.
"Yes he will. He will hurt this city if left unchecked. But this job is one I give to you. Because I trust you. I trust you to stop him." He solemnly says as he hands you a small knife.
"Will you stop him for me?"
"He will burn more buildings. Kill more people."
He takes you to a room in his house, High Rock Manor. Deeper through hallways it goes into the cliff
Inside this room is a long tiled floor of white stone, carved as a rectangle, but on one side there is an opening. It looks like a cave, and there is a small stairway that leads down to the cave inside. It is lit, with a crack in the ceiling above letting sunlight in. Grass grows on the ground here, and a tree grows on a hill in the middle. Under that tree, Lynn sees two men. One is sitting at the base of the tree, the other standing nearby. The first one Lynn doesn't know, but the other is Dudley,  a goliath with a nice mustache. Dudley is nice.
"Very Pretty isn't it?" says Rugon. "I worked hard to make this grass grow. It is a pretty spot of nature in this stone city. If this city were to fall, it would return to stone, and then back to nature. Much like this place. And it is important to remember where we come from." He turns to you, and gestures to the man sitting by the tree. You see now that he is tied up, and has a gag around his mouth.
"This man has been hurting this city. He has been burning down buildings he doesn't like, because someone he doesn't like worked there. He killed 5 people, but the man he wanted to kill is still alive. What do you think about that?"

"I don’t remember"
Lynn was just another poor homeless fellow in the Undercity. He lived off of what he could steal, talking to himself
How long this went on he has no idea, but one day a man came to him. Standing in the doorframe of some forgotten chamber, he found Lynn in this pitiful state
The man said he was there to help him. He didn't say why. Lynn cautiously nodded, and the man took him from the tunnels up to the city above. From there they climbed even higher, to a road that led up cliffs to many large houses and mansions.
Lynn soon learned that the man was called Rugon, and he was a very important man. He was very smart, paying attention to those who would hurt the city. He knew what to do.  And he was kind to Lynn
He cleaned him up,  and put him to work. At first it was simple things like fetching things from the other room. Soon it became carrying his papers between meetings with him. Then one day, Rugon asked him a question. "Do you know how to kill, Lynn?"
got it
me do like sharing tho
its fine
if you dont wanna see it just say
whats up?
ok so heres the little character setup kevin gave me
thats the best one imo
no mask of many faces?
ooh right
i dont even know your invocations
firebolt? not eldritch blast?
exactly
kevin did a little character set up thing with me after last weeks session that i kinda want to share with you
lvl 1 rogue, lvl 1 fighter
4 from dex, 2 from prof, 2 from fighting style
rn hes hitting with his ranged attacks on a +8
at lvl 20 he will have a passive perception of fucking 25
passive perception fucking 17
+8 stealth +7 perception
+4 and +3 respectively
but his dex and wisdom are poppin
-1
that much is in his backstory
he does know violent murder tho
havent played him so its hard to think about what he knows and doesnt know
idk yet
Oh well.
im sure he is
but this new guy? holy fuck i dont think he even knows what sex is
i personally make most of my pcs prudish. probably speaks to my personal character
B E A R S
what are you looking for? a pawg?"
ik
im sure he will reciprocate
try to make moves on apone
youre just horny
ok nvm
oh
but i can see why you wanted to go after the guy because it would probably involve more action n shit
i kinda like more urban fantasy settings imo
but fr i wasnt super interested in doing another dungeon delve after that first one
its a pendulum. at one point we'll be at another juncture and we will do what you want to do
sometime party swings one way and other times they swing another
sometimes game do be like that
this is just the theory of an idiot with an addled psyche
see where im going with this?
which explains his absence
and he was the guy who booked it outside the city
what if he wanted terror to make a distraction so he can go inside platts office and get the info
and he sent terror to go try and steal some statues
Rockne disappeared after the gala bullshit
oh and for kevins game i just had a super wonky conspiracy theory
is it still d20s or what?
so hows abaddon's game system?
battletech is set in an entire galaxy
40k?
because imperial knights and godmachines are a thing in the 40k
but its kinda like shitty 40k
mostly from a relatively recent videogame in the setting
i dont know a lot about battletech
yes
the setting is called battletech
sorry i kept saying battlmech
steiners are from battlemech
for the setting made by abbadon
oh right
FULL HEAVY MECH LANCES
i like the steiners
but kinda rad
because battlemech is wonky as fuck
mechs? like the battlemech universe or just something he made up
ill just muse.
or dont
you might even say that this individual could be refered to as a man inside the box
particularly the men that lounge within them
tell me more about boxes mars
I was way more interested in the town plotline 
It happened 
Well
does he actually run a game on his channel?
this is how to gm
I don't recognize
matt colville?
incorrect
acq inc is better
that was awful
my fucking skype keeps crashing
did you figure your schedule out for sunday?
some sort of pheromone bullshit he excretes from his skin
i think he has to directly tell them to do it
I don't know
just for shits and giggles
like in Jessica jones (I haven't seen the show) he walks into a police precinct and makes everyone in there kill eachother
ok so his power is that if I he gives a command to another person they have to do it
reminds me of kilgrave which is one of my favorite marvel villains
also a fuckin name like Kilgore
got it
big brain
very cool
and enjoy the clock. if I don't see you refer to it at least once a session I will steal it from you
nice crown
well... didn't see that
like Indiana jones?
your character's backstory is that he comes from a family of artifact collectors?
can I ask you something?
pike's fang
i wrote it down let me find it
7 min by your first estimate
how far off?
still at work?
how is it looking?
Misclick I think
also like... sociopath?
suggestion doesn't work like that I think
what are you doing sprinkling powder on their faces saying skadiddle skadoodle your dick is now a noodle?
jane the ripper
oh no we're doing this again
you got any more meat on that pc for me or that's what you've got so far
so your wizard is paranoid and makes new names everyday?
it might get wonky but lets see how it goes
but yeah that's kinda how im going to play my 19 rogue/1 fighter
like what I plan on saying when he talks about his amnesia he will talk about worms in his head taking away some things and giving him new things (things referring to memories)
he also has a really weird way of talking
or kinda waves their hand in his face to get his attention
its just that he wont respond unless someone says it or touches him
no its his real name
he also has to count on his fingers
and if someone asks for his name he will take a second, go into his bag to find a piece of paper, read it, and then say his name
and he wont remember his name but he will respond to it
or if they say his name
he sees them pointing at him
so he wont respond to anyone who calls him unless they touch him
so im going to play him like hes kinda socially retarded
and he has an int of 6
so he has serious amnesia
no
to
its minor
do you care about character spoiler bullshit?
the name thing reminds me of something im going to do with the rogue for kevins game
and Ill share some of mine too
EVERYTHING
tell me
with a fucking cleric
but its really hard to die
im working at it
Ik
i dont want the other players to know
jsut
we are talking about the same thing
up
shut
up
shut
he faked me out
im upset
stop
god damn it
mars you cunt
then I guess its just my alzheimers acting up again
ok
it was like you w-
yeah you were saying something as I cut the call
what did you say?
you cut off
start brewing up some toxic combinations to supplement damage
assassins get proficiency in poisoner's kit
but hey. that fighting style helps out with that
and youre only rolling one dice in a round so... don't fuck it up
but all that shit means nothing if you fucking miss
and since youre an assassin, who gets crits on surprised enemies, using a big crossbow is good as the damage dice is a d10, the second highest in the game
but that's way later down the line
you can eventually put more points in fighter up to 3 to get action surge and the champion fighter subclass to get crits on 19, which is pretty good for rogues
and also second wind but like who the fuck cares
so you take a dash in fighter to get those proficiencies while also getting the fighting style for +2 to hit with ranged attacks
but they don't have the proficiencies to get to use big crossbows
so it doesn't fucking matter. you don't need to waste a feat for that shit
rogues don't have multi attack
but heres the thing
well crossbows in the game have this fucking loading trait that prevents you from using it for multiattack unless you have the feat that negates it
from darksouls?
and when you do, you do big damage
shoot once and hope you hit
it depends on who dies first, markus or damian.
crossbows are cooler so ill use crossbows
aesthetics before actual power
but tbh I don't care
since they literally don't exist
so yeah im going for a urban medieval sniper hitman feel to this
also crossbows are fucking rad.
but like... you cant fucking shoot a longbow prone
i mean like using a longbow is supposed to be stronger and blah blah blah
im going for more like a urban hitman feel
using a heavy crossbow to shoot people from 400 feet away
assassin rogue with a dash of fighter
in either
because im a lunatic and that's all i really care about
i have an idea for a dnd character and build im going to try next when i get to make a new fucking pc
the flesh is weak
thats retarded
if you can manage to get food and water for a week on that budget you need to tell me all about that
12 bucks?
i feel like youre overselling it
how much would the uber be anyway man
money tho
but like
umm
ill be honest if you dont want to spend the money fuck it just come late
to test your mic
get on discord
But have to wait until more players join
And am now in a game
I beat the tutorial
How does the game work
So umm
Idk if you noticed
Eric also does the same eye roll as my sister btw
And I get angry when someone calls me out
And my dad is just bad at keeping to his lie
My mom is hard. You kinda have to just go with gut
My sisters tick is she rolls her eyes
And I can only reliably tell if a family member is lying
I’ll give it a try
Sounds cool
come and get it pussy
fuck you heretic
bet you wish you were a fuckin angel dude. maybe then people would like you
then that's how its gonna be
so if your fuckin tiefling warlock is having daddy issues with his fiend patron
lore and character story is everything
but in all things, gameplay is gay
yep yep yep
and they get something for booklock
and its actually pretty good
raven queen gets the familiar
idk what they do. I just know theyre good for blastlock
or some homebrew patron
raven queen?
booklock might make you more free to do silly shit
I don't have any spells yet but im looking at combos with knight's move, weightless pursuit, and summons of justice
figured out any dumb combos yet?
and others.... ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I only really looked at mine and really like a few of them
and your spells?
did you read that nightmare post on strongholds n shit?
Anyways next week is his first session. He’s been hyping up your character
Idk that’s not how I read it
Maybe
And she said she didn’t know where they would lead. If he other time she was vague about the tokens was when it was the necro tokens
They didn’t teleport the tokens they charred them
They were supposed to kill us if we used it
Those red tokens don’t teleport people
I had a thought
i think he has to go do something else
and my chem notebook is my spellbook
smog is a toxic fog. cloudkill is a toxic fog. im a 9th level wizard
cloudkill
Does that make me a lvl 9 wizard?
5th level spell too
I learned how to cast a dnd spell irl with natural components 
phoenix wright until the warlock and sorcerer lose their shit and start flinging lightning bolts
i cant wait until everyone will be battling with persuasion rolls to get what they want
im pretty sure everyone will fuckin be proficient with persuasion.
everyone in this party knows how to talk their way out of every situation.
that's a lot of fucking charisma
do you know what our team comp is?
that's what ill have
ill have high ac
no ill have 1 more than you
no wiat
don't matter tho. ill have phat hp
dex saves are pretty important
str saves literally don't exist
-1 dex
im just more spread
+10 overall vs your +10 overall
technically our bonuses match btw
amazing
2 paladin dump stats are as high as the 2 most important physicals
i have huge mental
and i said yeah
i mean he asked if it was ok
well I rolled 2 17s but kevin decided that, as the character is 100 years old, the physicals take a -2 but the mentals get a +2
this is gay
excuse me
um
what
then you realize the paladin has mediocre physical stats
it looks good
15, 9, 15, 14, 14, 17
do it naow
share numbers
kevin knows what it is already
its pretty meh
I already rolled my statline
like heroic npcs n shit like that
but I said other "heroes" but not like other pcs
I didn't list mine
I was more referring to what you wanted to fight 
I just saw your tags on the google doc
didn't he send you the thing?
we'll see
102 years old
ohhhhhhh wee laddie
how old?
this wont end well.
a fucking aasimar paladin and a tiefling warlock walk into a bar
also what yours for kev's game? don't tell me any story beats just class and race n shit that I could see
what is hansa?
and just waiting for one to die or whatever so I can revolving door them in
more like 3 for any campaign im in
just only told him about 1
ive made fucking 3
also ofc I fucking already made a pc
hes literally a god emperor's angel
basically I made a medieval space marine
or FURY CONQUEST PALADIN MOTHERFUCKER YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
or FURY CONQUEST PALADIN MOTHERFUCKER YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
a 100 year old aasimar paladin for the homebrew god Omnerix, whose only demand is that you spread the worship of his divine being though either faith
Damian Amaris
stop fucking eating car shots
I mean you play league just fucking dodge the skillshots idiot
well
how far im allowed to go
I don't know how seriously I should take this because I could joke about it a lot but im not sure
well
oh shit
still alive tho
ive been told that you were involved... in an incident... that involves a motorized vehicle
so
well when youre ready give me a call
box acquired
lol
fucking get to it
so..
i am done now tho
well I needed the time to write some shit
the dungeon has been written except the last room. but theres no puzzle or combat in it its just a generic treasure room so we can just wing that
im all set for you now
im ready to go but i dont think you are
im back home
the combats are easy but id rather you didn't die to them
depends on if youre alone or with kev
so what time will work for you?
save for whatever interaction you have with either kevin, should he play, or the denizen of the dungeon
there will be some story telling but it wont provide too much room for you to express a character's... edginess
well the one shot will be basically 1 short dungeon. and that's it
I will have no pictures this will all be theatre of the mind.
we're playing to have fun
the end
aaaaaaaaaaaand then ill have nothing for you
you can refuse the job
here's a DM thing ill tell you
you know there's a guy in the town tavern whose going to give you the details of your next job
...and that's it
youre a minor adventurer looking for the next payday
so... backstory
...and thats about it
so we're gonna go out to dinner
ill definately be late because its my moms birthday
yeah tonight
its me trying my hand at story telling
its just going to be you
do you want to try my oneshot while eric is on break
i do
do you even actually have a fucking question
if you had a question that you keep to yourself
and whose fault is that
idk really
the best he can hope for is uhhh…. fucking kill undead
well i don't have a fucking backstory for him to latch on
boring
but he will anyways
i don't want eric to pull some sporagore bullshit
that's it
if markus dies and no one has a fucking revive spell
gay
thats
and again
but even then he was like no ill just story you a second life
not ashes
we had a cleric but he needs a body to work with
the character died
and im thinking but that's gay
when my ranger got disintegrated he was like do you want to keep playing
instead of letting players actually exercise any semblance of agency
but eric decided to pull some ex machina bullshit to keep you in
i had a means of resurrecting you
and i still hate how eric refuses to let pcs die
nor the care
i don't have the time
its finals week
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatever
lol
i kinda just wing it in sessions because i just hated playing the fucking blood hunter
also markus literally has no backstory
kappa
i think eric is giving shit to characters he likes
that gives him +2 con
vargach has a consumable
well... I mean most people
everyone has something
yeah I thought so
which doesssssssssssssss?
you got a magical thing
I don't fully get it
game is hard
except MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
everyone has magical swag rn
what
umm
ok
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
want to fill me in?
and now its just not efficient
they raised the prices on their ebooks recently
tbh if I wanted to start black library I would definitely go physical copies
ik
but if you aren't, you will have no idea what the fuck is happening
you could skip and go to some of the good ones
if youre familiar with horus heresy
I mean
and first heretic
a thousand sons
some of the best ones are Fulgrim
so some books are just kinda better than others
horus heresy has a bunch of different writers writing it
the first book in that series is called Horus Rising
i said you would have to start horus heresy
what series do you want the first book to
black library has a ton of different series
I have no idea
I’m just spamming alternate attacks
I have no idea what I’m doing
Ok
is it even fucking cross platform?
to what point do I have to play absolver?
play a terrible game like league
you subhuman
don't fucking tell me youre working at 930
or are you still at your dads
can you league
have a deranged underground youtube video
i got back from my parents' friends house
fair enough
still doing thanksgiving things?
how depressing
can you videogay?
And the first one she could attribute to herself
The first dead body the pc ever saw
Yep yep yep
And decided to commit suicide
The way the gym worded it was that the king accepted that he was an evil person
oh shit
and i was like
then he fucking drank it
i gave it to him because i thought it was like a big dick power move
he knew
no i poisoned it in front of him
and my character was kinda just shell shocked. the gm npc who was tagging along with the group had to like... escort my pc out of the manor
all the standard party members congratulated me
and she was responsible
that was my characters first time seeing someone die
and drink it
the kings response was to take the cup from my hand
and my character was trying to intimidate him by holding a poisoned cup of wine while asking "how do I best serve this city, my lord?"
we confronted the king in his manor with the information
and we found evidence of the king using his influence to stage hits on political opponents
because I wanted her to be more of a like a girl whose seeing how gritty and dangerous the world is for the first time
but I played it a lot better
the character backstory is the same as the dragonborn pally I played for like... 2 session in erics game
my character was supposed to supervise them to prevent them from doing something immoral and wrong
the standard party was investigating corruption within the city monarchy by infiltrating the king's manor looking for evidence
im in santa monica
in person
it was a short 3 hour session from 6-9
I was playing dnd earlier today with some of the guys from aero
lol
and no one else did
the individual in the control tower conducted himself with decorum and restraint
and didn't last long
it started serious
this little animatic is great
so you said youve never heard of acq inc
we were kinda just a group of armed people who traveled around looking for jobs to do
i did when i played at aero
i mean
as in a group of nobody adventurerers
also we've never played dnd in ernest
not even for combat
dont make maps
trust me
yeah good luck mang
pfft
neither would i
but that brings out a problem in of itself
and can control the pcs and story better than milo
at least eric fleshes out his world
very cool
thank you milo
then milo copy pasted that line for EVERY NPC WE TALKED TO ON THAT BOAT
but that doesnt matter
i donnnnnnnnnnnnnnnno
... the second line his character had was his admitting to wanting to break a piece of michael's dick in his ass
by making... another gay character
by introducing him like that
you cant make a fucking intersting narative with a character
is fucking autism
also a chester character
hard gm moves
again
michael is fervnet in defending his pc actions. which is... fucking absurd
so i knew what was coming all along
and milo said i was right
going to go. he told me we were on a boat and i told milo that the boat would crash and we would be stuck on an offshore island
milo told me how the start was
im fuckin out
but if its the same shit agian
ill play one more
idk
i just didnt like the game milo ran
idk
thats what im saying
gms who are lax and afraid to do anything to the pcs are just bad
gms that arent afraid of doing hard moves on their players are good
i think the gm would have still killed the pc
i dont think that would have mattered
later on he said he was ready to kill the 3 pcs who were in on it if we didnt plan it out well and rolled good enough to back it up
but the plan we had for doing it was good and executed flawlessly
earlier the pcs killed 2 tavern owners in the middle of a major city
and that was it
and that the cart that the other pcs were in was leaving town
he warned the player 2 times that this was a crowded town
is a hard move. and a good gm
that
there wasnt a single roll
the gm described how his pc was captured by guards, had his hands cut off, and was hung for arson, attempted murder, and permanently injuring a man (the shop owner's husband)
and fireballed the fucking building in broad daylight
so what he did was go out back of the shop whose owner rejected him
a pc got smack talked in town
in the game i was playing at aero hobbies
thats what im saying about milo being afraid of being hard on pcs
you know that wouldnt have meant anything in game terms right
but... what the fuck did you think was going to happen if you break into the captains fucking quarters
im pretty sure he would have been salty at me if i did that
i would have had michael whipped and decreased his con score by 1 permanently
and if he did it agian i would have him whipped even worse or maybe even killed him then
i would have had him whipped
i wouldnt
what the fuck would you have done if you were a military commander who caught a person trying to break into your personal coffer
ok here's the thing mars
amazing
fucking
then shit went fucking crazy and milo made bruuj majul and made every npc gay
but then michael said: i want to be a twink
and he had an idea for what he wanted to do
when milo was talking to me about it he said it was going to be a serious run
but back to the topic of milo's campaign
i dont think i would be able to cut through 8 characters
because i was going to instantly channel divinity and fear them all and go crazy for an entire minute of combat
idk if i went inside that tower how many people would you have had me fight?
we call that move the omnislash
uhhhh id like to attack 6 times with action surge
its like getting close enough to a wizard as a high level figher and saying to the gm
well i mean double divine smiting a lvl 3 pc does tend to kill them immediately
combat was me waiting for someone to spot the bard then stab them when they were about to pass my tree
me oneshot everyone
fuckin' hell naw
the guy who tried to plunging attack me
was your rogue the one who was supposed to do that
10 people died, and i was responsible for 5
im pretty sure i was the single most deadly motherfucker on the field of battle
i mean
and won
in my headcannon shallya evicerated everyone she got near
remember your oneshot
hey mars
there wouldnt be a difference
i was about to say just that
get the fuck out of here witht hat
he said hes 19
12 or something
i didnt want to fucking berate keta about it because keta is like
i noticed that
you cant roll to hide in the fucking open because thats dumb
go find something to hide behind
you dont "go into stealth"
also heres a thing
which is what it is
and not like a party game
because he plays it like a video game
i dont think michael is a good player
idk
what
fucking...
umm
aparently michael was upset my character is an item hog who "converts matter and destroys shit so noone else can have it"
i dont get it
it was dumb
i dont care what eric's plan was
putting a cr 15 monster isnt a normal combat
he is. in a normal combat he would totally pull punches
milo is afraid of killing pcs
what the fuck do i do now
and i was like
then milo threw me a fucking curveball
i knew what i wanted to do
i dont know if i want to keep kormin
yeah
im not excited for session 2
tbh
it has a lot of lore already attached its honestly the easiest to try and do
i dont know why you guys have such a viceral hate for faerun setting
i could just run a fucking module like curse of straud or something like that
if i dmed. r20 would only be for rolls and thats it
or the fucking patience to even bother with the maps
but i dont have a story
i feel like i would be a fuckin great dm
heres the thing
then i, the gm, say roll persuasion
you have to say something fucking persuasive
thats retarded
you dont say "i roll for persuasion"
and here's the thing
he did get away with anything and everything he tried to do
i dont care what michael says
and i was like.... omg they are all going to be like this...
then milo made every fucking npc the same character
i was playing a relatively serious character that i had ideas for
the fucking shitshow that was the first session made me actually consider bashing my head open
ill be honest
she got no clothes but some cropping might help out
theres the xcom 2 viper
yeah
and imo the best ones are the more humanoid ones
but they are all female
when looking about for pc race ideas i did find some cool yuan ti pictures
with light scaly features
some yuan ti look very human
not all
how.... snakey are you going for...
hallo?
whats up
nope
so I did
I think I should
that can take a while
youre being difficult
again im mentally challenged and you have to be literal with me
I kinda need to know if you were memeing me
or just put it in the group chat
when its done ill show you
im making a hotline bling meme template about medea
im doing a greek myth project where we have to do a creative piece on one of the plays we read
also have you ever read the medea play by euripides?
also fail no nut november already so i can talk horus heresy w/ someone
war hounds= world eaters if you didn't know
she had to be one crazy lady for the fucking war hounds to be like dayum shes cool
that's fucking exceptional
kharn liked her
angron liked her
shes special because the fucking war hounds liked her
she also went full traitor when Angron got a huge murderboner
she was the human admiral who basically helped the warhounds with their ship movements during the great crusade
im sad that I know exactly every character in that comic
mars KETA IS WOKE?
well you know what zangeif looks like
skype is being dumb
no?
are these pictures sending?
lol
also he sure as shit isn't 19
fundamental parts of his class
this guy has like no idea how to play dnd
misclick
fffrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
lol
So I figure I just got you a repeat customer
Well mars my dm said, and I quote, “I’m going there every day until I see him”
and that taco Thursday is heresy
you should have told him tacos are only for tuseday
you should have told him tacos are only for tuseday
or did you just creep on him
did you say you liked his show or something?
he lives in downtown la and he asked to see if he knew
yeah
since hes a critical roll fan
I told my dm who I played with over the summer you saw sam riegel at the bar you worked at
whats the name of the bar you work at?
hey mars I have a question
just have to not nut for one month
alright
and mine?
that's your punishment
have you read horus rising?
I honestly have no idea
what do you want the challenge punishments to be?
i think every party member can cast magic except the rogue
i don't think i would be allowed to play this in a "good guy" campaign
lightning lure and shocking grasp and shit like that
when i was gonna make the eldritch knight i was only going to take lightning related spells
club or quarterstaff
and if i was fighting something immune to physical attacks, why not use an actually damaging cantrip?
i don't have a quarterstaff man
idk why i would ever use shillelagh
idk why i would ever use shillelagh
that is slowly killing me
its like a dragonmark
when i use my blood magic? yes
i don't actually know which ones are bonus action
now I can do both just really inefficiently
idk man I wanted to play eldritch knight but also cavalier
I attempt to persuade. HOLD UP LET ME CAST THIS GUIDANCE FIRST BLAHAHHAHAHAH
fucking puke up a storm but get that sweet sweet 1d4
like I can just do a quick guidance on myself or someone else in an rp section
im feeling it for guidance rn
or cast message or shit like that
I can do it for 5 hp
if I need to do something like mending and im the only one there
im more leaning to the utility end of things
so.... pretty good first session
on the plus side I can cast every cantrip in the game and have a horse now
but when the human tries to fix his problems with overwhelming violence everyone loses their shit
then we have a lizard whose allowed to be immoral because hes a fucking dinosaur person
everyone is playing fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucking bleeding heart moralists
I actually don't know what youre referring to
B L A C K S P E E CH
everyone is here I think except you
are you almost home?
I don't want to feel like these npcs are carrying me
that's lame
were babysitting npcs
did you check the r20 recently?
aaaaaaaaand youre probably at work
FOREIGN
is he...
did this nigga really ask what a dmv is
Welp I guess I’ll be dead
don't we have a cleric or something?
but then they all put their attention onto me and I get fucking shredded
basically im a tank I stand still and make life hard for them
and if they get hit, they just have to stand there
more like you stand still and if anything gets near you you swipe at them
kinda like the feat
also yeah the lvl 15 thing is called ferocious charger
this coupled with the free sentinel makes this class one of the best defenders in the game
and finally if you don't do anything for a turn, until your next turn you get UNLIMITED ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY
(horses count for this)
then you get to fucking smash people onto the ground if you run a bit before you hit them
even later you get sentinel for free
you can block good later
they can mark targets which punishes them for attacking something that's not you
everything else ignores the fucking things
it actually has only one thing related to horses
cavalier?
… AND THATS IT
and quickenspell on the sorc
… AND THATS IT
what you really want is agonizing blast
but yes
that will never be useful
I don’t really have a backup
Also wtf is your backup pc?
I thought I was going to be the old man at 47
Well now
How old is your pc? Because the backstory reads like he’s 20 but the pictures you like depict older guys
Third paragraph and his blood join with all the others
And he always the loudest
Second paragraph  he was weak and HE work...
And hojart used it the gif of the Jotun
Grammar in first paragraph 
And I know grimdark 
Also the very last one you just posted is pretty grimdark 
The last one is very... cute... if that’s what you’re going for.
and I love them wings
both pics have the wings
or
which one is better
one mounted and one unmounted
also rn I have two pics
(devil)
who said we will begin with you far away from me
but then ill just run at you and beat you to death
but when I get one it wont handle rough terrain at all
well my horse currently doesn't exist
that soul of a fucking giant will do you so much good when I fucking trample you to the ground and jam a lance in your chest
fuck you im a crazy horselord who wants to live forever by being a fucking butcher of men
2 fucking sentences
"Marik was a slave under the empire... took the reins, mounted the horse, and had it trample the disgusting q'thraa to broken chitinous plates and blood." the end
so I fucking stomped him to death
my whole story was some guy talked shit
what the hell is this life story shit
man I had 2 fucking paragraphs
40 minutes becomes 5
lol you got nothing
you got your tacos or what?
well man
When Marik was a slave under the empire, his charge was to breed mighty creatures of war for his masters. Though he knew what they would be used for, he took great joy in seeing what he helped bring into the world grow powerful and dangerous. Of all the monsters and animals he had the honor of breeding, none would capture his admiration as much as a great warhorse. While not the most ferocious, nor the most dangerous, Marik's horses blended elegance and fury on the battlefield unlike any other beast of war. Pride in his profession would one day get the better of him, when one of his mightiest stallions would refuse to bow to its would be q'thraa master. When Astelan was accused of failing to break the horse, the incensed horse breeder took the reins, mounted the horse, and had it trample the disgusting q'thraa to broken chitinous plates and blood.Marik's dangerous pride doesnt end just at his charge when he was a slave. He too believes that the short lives of men compared to the rest of his fellow slave races meant that an indomitable will and unmatched courage would be needed to truly make a mark on this world. This will and courage are the hallmarks of man, unmatched by any other race. Astelan was taught that a man dies twice, once when he stops breathing and once again when the last memory of his deeds fades into nothing. Marik Astelan Will Never Die Twice.
ill give you mine
or do you want to keep it to yourself
when youre done you wanna throw it my way?
and nothing in that tells you about his powers
I remember eric kept railing on me for making a pc that would betray the party
fuckin what?
seems good
mine was someone questioned my life's work as a slave. so I beat the shit out of him
if you remember how we (the pcs) were to be butchered
you have to have done something that got you in trouble
you and your giant soul
idk giants or some shit
youre a sorc right? its easy. your dad put his dick in the wrong thing and out came you
fucking how
mars PLEEEEEEEEEEASE
do you have a story yet?
FOR CHAOS UNDIVIDED
I might even consider doing my crazy wild magic sorc
if we didn't have so many gat damb casters
Are you being smart with me?
I mean I still don’t get it
O K 
I see nothing special
All I saw was Eric bragging and going on about wines and beers
So after looking at the logs
I’ll find it myself then
But it’s impossible to understand without it as well
Context?
he can still say no
even if its legal
again id run it by eric
mhmmm
i can tell
run that one by eric and see if he will let you
umm
is that legal?
tome is probably best if youre not retarded
...ok
I don't understand what coffeelock is
I don't understand what coffeelock is
explain
ok this is the last 40k shitpost
alpharius
They don't know it is I
MFW they think guilliman killed alpharius
aren't we all?
i mean
or I am alpharius and you will get where im getting the meme from
I mean just look up alpharius
alpharius
I would make an alpha legion marine and name him...
in black crusade you can play a chaos space marine
OPEN WIDE THE MAW OF CHAOS
you can be a literal chaos sorcerer
ok how bout wild magic
idk I was digging shadow for a while
sure
or that one
draconic
is it a bloodline thing?
that's only 8 hp
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
NO TELL ME NOW
NO
a feat or something?
like...?
that should be 7 hp
I thought your rolls were dogshit
16 con what the fuck
you start with 8 max rather than 6
I honestly would have started lock because their health dice are better
youre level 1 man
we have a grotesque amount of casters
so you went with warlock?
whatever I wanted a winged hussar
or party.... skewering...
like... party.... trampling...
I can do a lot more than party tension
being the lunatic on a horse with heavy armor, lance, and shield
weeeeeeeell
he thinks only humans are capable of real courage because their shorter lifespans demand more bravery.
but between you and me
also eric wont let me make a racist character because that would "cause party tension"
not edgy backstory OMEGALUL
mounted the horse
mounted the horse
so I asked for the reins
so I asked for the reins
then I trampled the fucker until he was bone dust
and he blames me
one day some guy comes to me and complains that the horse he got from me wont obey
my backstory is that I bred horses and other scary ass monsters for the empire
what got you in trouble with the boss?
how was your back story
well mars
They know they have to have mics right?
But in all seriousness I’ll have no idea until Saturday 
I do my best not to think
high or low
mars
it wont last
hmmmm
dont choke that would be bad
eric will have his hands full parading these..... things.... around
well
aren't we supposed to be grimdark?
:/
hmmm
weak
and what happened to a heart of stone?
hes 19?
thought you got rid of that guy man
even tho weve never used horses
im actually gonna go with a cavalier
?
so you've picked out who we're dealing with
and 3 randoms?
so we have us 2
umm
how did you go about doing that?
...did you decide?
he looks like hes 15? and that's it?
yes?
is that the only concern
flip a coin
im fucking 19
this nigga doesn't look 19
that's my largest concern
how old is this guy
umm
you want to play pallylock or sorclock
im playing a eldritch knight
it looks like every one of our pcs will have magic
or another caster
a barb/druid which is one of the most popular multiclasses?
what do you want
well guy
it gives both players a fair shake
why not
flip a coin
I don't think class should dictate who we are gonna play with
how many people did you find?
good luck don't die
so...
hes very willing to kill pcs if they step out of line
milo*
because according to milo
because according to milo
by your co
just don't do anything that will get yourself shot
idk about this one man
I uh
What the fuck am I looking at?
yikes.
because.
when cc is around the corner ask milo about that one
….
I don't think that's standard issue
youre a private in the military
holstered rifles at the hip?
also...
just want to make a big ox of a man
or something like that
i was going to make a dragonborn whos working in a relative's farm when hes drafted
keep that in mind before you make a character that will be shot for insubordination
…. we are drafted into the military of a colonizing power and sent to a recruitment and training camp session one
but..... not full auto ars
so no 30 second reload
well dude theyre gonna be magic muskets
maybe if it was the 1800s industrial revolution setting i could make my admech lunatic
but also guns
with dragons and shit
except..... fantasy
yeah we're in colonial america
i cant turn myself into a semi sentient, machine worshipping lunatic in a 1700s America setting
also in milos campaign i wont be able to play an admech because his setting wont allow it
jesus i hope he doesn't ram us with a fucking macguffin in the first 4 sessions
because i don't want the fucking campaign to be I WANT MAGIC SWORD
or not
you should be building for late game
and if erics earlier campaigns are anything to go off of
shadow can be obscene at high levels
and sorc is only for the metamagic
that does mean youre going to mainly be going into warlock
and roll 8 dice
use metamagic to cast 2 eldritch blasts in a single turn
warlock sorc hybrid
or, and check this
its absurd
if you put 1 (or 2 if you want some invocations) and the rest in paladin
warlock paladin is one of the strongest character combos in the game
you?
just only get spells that involve lightning
and act like a space marine librarian
i had an idea to make a eldritch knight
idk what i want to play
well... hes not letting us play our gun nuts
wait until he fucking treats his rabies
ill just wait until either he calms down or not
if he doesn't want me in his campaign or what
idk what the situation is as far as dnd goes
or on league
but he didn't remove me as a friend on skype
i think he kicked me from the skype chat
I cant praise the machine god
eric did not give me the ok
praise be to the blessed machine
this was what I was going to make
why the fuck he doesn't fucking tell me
did you want to play artificer? 
im basically making an ad mech
gunsmith
We would do well to keep that in mind
As of now, milos campaign doesn’t exist
I don’t like having a particularly bullshit character
But now most of us do
I think we did that because nobody knew how to play
Which is something I didn’t like
Instead of immediately saying come to my house I need you to murder a powerful nobleman
Like I feel like if after some time on our own maybe a session of doing whatever like a regular dungeon delve she contacts us for another job, that would have been fine
 But the progression to becoming her servants was odd
I feel like that was fine and fun
If at all
Idk I think a good campaign lets players be somewhat normal for a time before they are essentially deified
In dnd the way you permanently kill someone with no chance of bringing them back is to turn them into ash
I got fucking vaporized man
Do you get what I’m saying?
And doesn’t want his adventurers to kinda bum around taverns and be normalish people for too long
And doesn’t want his adventurers to kinda bum around taverns and be normalish people for too long
Because he wants to ramp up the threat on the world
He doesn’t allow characters that aren’t his own to impact plot
Eric dms as if his players are watching a movie or reading a book
I just realized something
Lol
you work 7 days a week?
im guessing.... that's a yes
anyways are you doing anything rn?
fix that and we might actually have a game
idk. atlas disappearing every week is a problem
because the last time someone criticized his storytelling he threw a fucking hissy fit and we didn't play for over a month
i haven't told him
idk if eric is tho
i think other folks are aware that that's the case
idk
probably a multiphase thing. like kill him in his humanoid form then he becomes a big fuckoff demon
i saw his statline he had like 80 health
attempted to kill him before we got to that point
did i do enough? maybe not
he needed ahn to get the power, so even though atlas and i were working against that, it happened anyways
i cannot make any moves to avoid certain beats eric has already set out
i just think the world is going through the motions and we are just being dragged in the undertow 
I don't think we as characters in the world have an impact
however I wouldn't make the fucking maps or anything like that
I would totally dm if I had a god damb story
if he fails tell him HE HAS TO ACT ON THEM NOW OR THE DM WILL ACT FOR HIM
and if he succeeds describe how it feels straining against these sudden urges
with a high dc
and if there is a point where you think the new trait should kick in and he just isn't remembering or not acting on it make him do a save
BUT THATS WHAT YOU FUCKING GET WHEN YOU PICK UP AND ATTUNE A GOD DAMN CURSED WEAPON
despite it being out of character at the start
like if some traveler or something like that is giving him a hard time he might fucking snap and tear his head off
and it would be up to him to act on this new trait
like if you have 10 corruption, id tell the player that he becomes more inclined to extreme acts of violence when under duress
if I was dming, I would have cursed items give players corruption, which would affect their judgements in ways THEY get to choose
again I would have fucking chucked the damn thing out a fucking window by now because I HATE HAVING FUCKING ITEMS MAKE HARDLINE DECISIONS FOR ME
and he just forced it to go through by saying something along the lines of fuck you the sword wants to
like I tried to avoid letting ahn get the green superpower or whatever the fuck it is
and you cannot go around them
his story has specific beats he HAS to hit
also erics storytelling is starting to get to me if you know what im talking about
ik
its been like this for over a month
but I think he knows its become grating for us to constantly lose him
anyway I don't want to drop him from campaign because that's super lame
ive been awake since 730
ok
it seems that you and eric are the only ones who can do that
I have no means of contacting him
if he is unwilling to do anything and expects us to simply be fine with having to constantly lose one player, that's when we have a concern
if he is able to stay awake during campaign that's the end of it
if he is willing to drop from the campaign that's the end of it
like ask him what we should do about this
I mean talk with him specifically
talk w/ everyone else
talk w/ others about it
seems like a dick move
you god damn psycho
if you have any fucking redeemable qualities ill find them
that's the plan
im gonna make an effort to try to work with your character
because i have a feeling that's what will happen if i do not do what he wants
and i don't want to instakill both our pcs
i don't really want to give the devil guy what he wants
i certainly hope that doesn't mean IM MAIN CHARACTER NOW
i wasn't told that im a chosen one in my backstory
that's fine
and we're the lunatics running around ruining shit for everyone
I don't think anyone else is here
we're 30 min out
don't tell me you locked yourself out again :p
Usually we stab first ask questions never
How often are we surprised?
If you’re looking for some funny videos you could watch old episodes of whose line is it anyway on youtube
You were there when he was developing his exploding bag of holding right?
And stab the cleric if he becomes a problem
Also don’t accept deals from disembodied voices
Don’t stab me for wreaking your tent
I blame that on you
My pc almost died mars
and aren't wee laddies
I’m done but it looks like you just started
Want to die
Am at work
that should totally be why we're there
Why would you do this to yourself
:p
drow scheming intensifies yes we can totally get wasted handrubbing intensifies
how old is she?
I kinda want to know how she got out of being abused
i got to put in the tattoo on her wrist and make it related to the izlodi arc

Class started
Eric didn’t like him
He took 600 damage in one session
We had 1 pc die over 11 sessions
We have to be aware that it is possible hansa just won’t die
And what do you mean sending that picture first?
She still looks fucked up
because what you did after wasn't at all :p
i think hell probably have to pull some sort of special mechanic to beat me
deVil inThe DetAils
KILL MYSELF
tis true
but did you decide to do the hardcore mode that I recommended with guns and spells hurting
or i might just forswear off magic and make a dwarf fighter
warp back
I thought it was that he doesn't want to be in a game with both myself and eric in it
see you all next week when we have to struggle with coming to terms on how to tell eric why we aren't playing then
well... good talk
become stagnation
succumb to entropy
this conversation is a lovely break
if you do im not a part of it. what with studying and all
that's not english
thanks mars
can we get opinions on this in the chat boys?
if you dm and you want your pc there... just make it happen
its up to the dm that week how he handles it
who knows
busy doing smth else
or hes not even there
and all their stuff
the players will keep their pcs
then pass it on to another guy
do your plan
the point is if you got a plan for like 3 or 4 sessions
ok back on track
yes
not yours
kevs game
and tbh the shit we saw in the mountains was probably the most important thing we saw the entire campaign
we were not in the mountains for 8 weeks bruh
the mountains thing took 3 sessions
the end
then next session we found him and hes a bad man lets get him
hey guys we need to find this guy
whoevers got plans to do smth
like if you have a complete arc in 2 sessions you dm 2 sessions before someone else takes it
like if you have a complete arc in 2 sessions you dm 2 sessions before someone else takes it
just arcs
like how we do the motw
… yeah?
ill ask again i think its a good idea imo
i did ask if you guys want to try the shifting dm thing
he'll be super understanding because its you saying it and not me
so.... tell him you don't want to play and that you thought mars was dming
eric
apathy is just as grave an insult as outright contempt
you cant say that
do we all want to try the alternating dm thing?
said I couldn't do Saturday as well
which is why I cant play at all this weekend
my test is monday
that is if everyone here wants to do it at all
if you do it hell get less upset
pitch it to him. if I do it hell get upset
idk
i thought for a second we could do the alternating dm thing
ffffffffffuck
wait... are you dming mars?
well... back to making a dystopic nightmare town i guess
how terrible
and so he's trapped me
despite saying he doesnt want me back and myself saying i dont want to come back
ehh
so...
and if i leave he'll literally combust
so apparently he does want me back
because i have to study for a test this weekend and cant do anything friday
am i in the game or not
i dont get it
:/ well that just robs us of the credit for all our hard work
the problem child has been removed
he wont
erics safespace
based
drops hard r
first thing mars does when he has gm
also
s t I l l d o n t
well... he isn't wrong when he said I didn't care
k
people say im too fucking serious
he needs to take things less seriously
you are gm by the looks of it
i didn't get anything
read what?
even i don't think im worth it
or did he do that show and dance to get rid of me. if so, that's a big production just to get me away when a "go away" would suffice
so is that fellowship thing real and he gave you dm
eric doesn't give us that
but you get to choose to go down that track
that's what youre doing
when you go down one of those 3
theres one track, then three
imo most dnd is railroaded it just branches
well... we never start on time
optimal
and in 2 days it fucking crumbles
i just think its funny eric spends weeks writing all this bullshit
well... we all actively wanted to break it
and im proud
all of us did our part
we did it together
love to know
can i perchance get someone to dm me what he said?
ok
so if you think that was reason to eject me then
anything i said in the skypecall you guys heard
also he might be mad that i was saying that it doesn't matter that we're not playing today
or is he not
is he playing
so i don't get it
that was the entire convo
i said ok
he said no
i asked him if i could rn
honestly idk
then he lost his shit
i asked him if i could
yes
I really do have his number or something
whatever
well
so
he never told me
What a guy
So I was
Huh
If that was enough to trigger Eric’s meltdown then honestly idk why I bother
All I said was that I wanted to swap characters, that he let you do it, then said I’ll play Alain until I don’t have to
Was I kicked?
let him
that's cheesing?
… you mean learning the game?
getting good?
ask milo
yeah youll have a bad time
I mean if you outright refuse to use embers
g e t g o o d
:p
at least they don't lose their mental and restart their entire game after dying to genichiro a few times
Loyalty test
Problem is they aren’t Ashina guards. We don’t know how acceptable to violence and brutality they are
outright hostile one at worst
outright hostile one at worst
unreliable narrator at best
but is she? that's just what eric told us
super good memory guys
she has like
keep it up
very chad response king
you may be taking my statement too seriously king
theres a conspiracy
maybe it was fat iroh
… the fuckin ranger?
map to the avocados
we should have known
thaaaaaats why eric wanted us to go there
wrote it on a napkin at the bar
see youre just really sounding like a narc right now
us being myself and miles
if you dont know what shes gonna do, what exactly did eric tell you related to how she doesnt like us
then we just go and do whatever
and we stab her when shes asleep then
i wake up miles
at the end of my watch, its my job to wake up the next person
i take first watch
on the first night away from town
ok to go over the exact plan of how its gonna happen
then find some other thing ourselves?
should we just go out on the expedition, kill her on the first night to not go to her trap
and when eric denies it then well... fuck him
if he forgets that ill remind him when it comes up
mayor and his cabinet
because eric has a problem with us dehhhhh
thing is, i think the grove is where she is gonna fuck us
kinda gay
she was behind a door and immediately knew what we were saying
is eric able to tell things to people despite us standing right next to his npc while we're not able to do that?
and what does dundee have to do with that?
mars you know exactly what shes gonna do?
wait i dont understand
nsa dont mind me
then we stab her
so lets just let her lead us to the avocados
honestly yeah
not my character
that hurts me
but being exposed to eric's bullshit
if i die idgaf
because honestly since im so not invested in this game and this character
the most heinous crime
....talk at us...
at which point it may be too late
especially since we spared her last session
and sways us. which, I think we all agree, wont happen
unless she goes off on another tirade about why we shouldn't
then we kill her as she fulfilled her use
she shows us the avocado grove, which is gonna solve our money problem for rn
just... fucking kill her then
with her
we're embarking out into the wilderness
thinking about ways to ruin erics dumb story is exausting
instead of taking watch
we just vibe check
when she's unconscious we get auto crits
we could just stab her to death in the night
With what mars said, do we intend on killing her still?
That is reason enough. And it has historical precedent
That is reason enough. And it has historical precedent
So we reason that to get the legislation we want through without being harried by the old staff is to purge them
And the people from the old council that aren’t us wont
We support it
We just have Milo propose radical legislation
I have an idea
Also I’m saying the n word
I’m going off script
Gay
im good sir
you have 2 16s
my highest number is 14
just fucking hit them lol
don't you have a real statline?
ill just dm you
even tho that show is pretty old by now
id reference breaking bad but I don't want to spoil it for anyone
a scary villain is better than a murderous one
it is better to rule over scared sheep than mountains of corpses
that's one more than me
honestly milo has signed more death warrants than I have
I have yet to put anyone to death
pfft
idk
how shameful
and we're the ones who suffer for it
eric wants bossy mommy gf?
as it turns out
the out of character reason is because eric took your backstory and added demon people being in charge of everything to it because he needed some bossy heroine lady to furiously beat off to
well that's the in character reason
its because theyre keeping humans under their thumb right?
I don't recall why exactly
# not all tieflings?
:///////////
which are you mars?
so
and the way entrenched systems go down is from the inside, not from the outside
an internal struggle so to speak, because eric lllllllllllloves the whole idea of entrenched systems
as she would be seen as legitimized by the people as being a real noble, even if she is actively serving our interests by using her legitimacy to wage war, politically or literally, on other nobles who are not sympathetic
however, if she proves valuable, then her being a part of that world may be a good foothold to bring down that system
then get rid of her
then implicate the entire system as being just like her
blow it out of proportion
wait for her to make a mistake
then wouldn't it be wise to keep a member of that system around?
is your problem with the noble system or the individual nobles?
im not so certain that it would be in your interest to do so even if she is in the nobility
are you a big titty dragon gf?
are you happy
yes
ok
chill
im about to
but if you really want her dead
ik
are we still stabbing one of the elves to death the first time we go to an expedition?
miles and I have been discussing about how we should turn our little outpost into a slice of USSR Russia
so how do we sow distrust in this population?
in other words total power and a populace fearful of itself only able to function if the government enforces order
in that all people under us have to capitulate their rights to the town government in so far that any covenant made within the town is enforced and exploited by the sovereign
i think we need to make our government a Sovereign
I had to read hobbes' leviathan
i was actually gonna make vaas montenegro
i just don't want him to use it as a cudgel to hurt us
but not how to use it
admittedly I was the one who told him that honor existed
is fucking dumb
which
like asking for honor instead of charis when persuading
unless he uses them differently
if you don't have bad charisma, honor is pointless
honor score is just charisma for people with bad charisma
bullshit
fucking
watch him take your criticism in stride
if I said it like that id get bertated
and eric will throw it out
lets just agree to not use it
that's just eric trying to satisfiy his add
amongst other things
basically call your move in 10 seconds or you do nothing
and so he made a bunch of rules to be annoying to us if we don't immediately move
eric is being retarded about how long turns take
idk. just eat him while we're stabbing him
who cares
why?
then mars eats the corpse to get rid of the possibility of eric saying "oh the other ranger finds the body with stab wounds and now they suspect you"
and while the elf is meditating, we stab the shit out of him
the person who is wakes everyone else up
on a night that the elf isn't taking watch
so we get one of the elves
we say that we need a guide to help us travel safely
in the event that we do an expedition
ok so we have a plan that involves us all
and now the old mayor is out and milo is installed
that shit is discovered
and fey are the ones puppeting him around
the old mayor is the corpse
weekend at Bernie's is a movie in which two guys puppet around a corpse trying to convince people that the dead guy is still alive
unless someone has a better idea
if you don't make that cannon im literally going to shit
milo the scandal is that the mayor was actually being weekend at Bernie'sed by fey
but now I guess he was caught sleeping with jailbait or whatever fucking scandal
and only milo came back
he said he and milo went hunting
:/
:/
thats not what he said first
you will be dragged there
if you resist
youre getting asked to follow us to the mayor's compound
and I hear about it
if you say something bad about the state
listen
eric wanted to make a campaign that involved faceless PCS who have no ties to the world, experiencing the story that eric hard coded into his writing
m
guess its her job to cough on hi
nvm my mom went to the door
brb

and also theres a person wearing a mask outside my front door

uhhhh

im changing from ranger to paladin
or whatever
I thought it was something like gigantia
does it have a name?
so they need to be vetted, and accepted
ofc we cant have everyone be guards
cut down the rations normal peasants receive, to incentivize people joining the guards
assuming that is something we want to do
assuming that is something we want to do
but if you give them benefits based on their performance, you can change that
insofar as that he's the one that pays them
8 guards not loyal to you wont cut it
t
still think we need to establish a power base in the town firs
and do what you want with them
just name a caste chattel
if eric has a caste system
YEAHHHHHS
I could league I guess
is there something particular youd like to do?

HOW HERETICAL
all my nibbas acting out where the wolves at
where the hood at?
skulls
no statement from michael
it seems that that is the case
that statement was super unclear about when
the roads are closed
they arent
tell milo that his time is up I guess
ummm
did you try to say no? or now?
when
campaign
but if I get into my lab, that will change
as of right now my Thursdays are clear after morning
actually
yes
this week after 12
umm
and then I'm good
tomorrow
THE HERETICS
ARE
WHERE
WHERE ARE THE HERETICS
oh and xenophobia
that's about it
I'm a dead'un that worships demons
I really don't have much more to talk about
one name leads to another
my character: I sense heresy... oh wait that's me.
not stacked matchup
cleric vs undead
eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
skulls for khorne
and you make me sad
I like murder and also youre overthinking the game
because... I'm sure he'll have much insight
with unka unk present
lets argue about it in character at the start of next campaign
its not very clear
I think
to run the fuck away
to get a boat
we're going to a fishing village just south of that fucked up city
and apparently we aren't even going southside
inhumans
and as such i will immediately call at precisely 1:30
i am nothing if not punctual
Edited previous message: that mans chat is unclean
and must be purified by cyclonic torpedoes and virus bombs
that man's chat is unclean
hes a fucking demon i bet
i just want to know what mars' reveal is
i donno
BIBBUH
i think we're abandoning you in a tavern or something
I believe so
 Have this picture
NUT DEMON
ALLAHHHHHHHHHHHH
no weaknesses lul
if that is when the heresy is vulnerable, then yesh
FINE
OK
ok
you do not know de wey
niet cyka
right now
like
I kinda need to know
is that a no or a yes to tomorrow
davai
and just let mars idle in the tavern
honestly its up to milo if he wants to delay
if you have late night work tomorrow as well, shouldn't we just delay it again?
the reason we didn't do it today is because you had late night work
i think so?
I'm going to school sunday
niet cyka
dew it
do it
just call the damn group
well if you want to see who can come
you didn't say it
"I'm triple gay"
only if you say the magic phrase
he said today is the best for him no?
cyka
niet
any day but friday
have we sufficiently harassed milo yet?
I think he should choose to not harass spellcasters that can kill him really hard with one spell
jett's new character is antagonizing the cleric
jett's old character antagonized the druid
mars your fucking keyboard is so fucking loud
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
were waiting on JETT AGIN
have to overshoot me huh milo
in 30 min
DIVERSITY
we have 3 humans
orks orks orks orks

miles didn't say he could play
umm
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD

I don't have anything prepared that kevin hasn't already seen
its your diet
idiot

im just doing hw while waiting
idk when hes good for it he said he can make it
I think kevin is out for rn
im here
im good for tonight
the birbs would have killed us 100 percent
I think if we didn't have the pally we would have lost
B A N I S H E D
I think we should continue while waiting to see if we find a +1 or so in the interim
lol
weve been out for like... a month
im ok to keep going
No, they do not
Is it?
I guess so
I guess not
was he ever actually here?
tbh
I mean
im here and ready
I cant tell
or something
and end of an era
perish
I’m good
im game either way
im ok with whatever yall decide
im good for it
you have to be sober for work sunday you dink
sounds like a good fucking time
what the fuck is that
WHAT
I am
and when I told mars id give him 1 more known spell for all his items that includes his spellbook
ThaNk yOu IsSin AsHInA
like any noble samurai
let me just pull out this gun I keep clenched in my asscheeks and shoot you with it
hesitation is defeat sekiro
then you'll have 2 backstories to write you fuck
so I swear to fucking god if he doesn't finish that shit before tonights game ill fucking throw etan off a cliff
mars has fucking homework to do

parents are disappearing and my sister told me to fucking stay locked in my room
I can probably play
youre retarded
Fuck that
They are grad students 
They are grad students 
I might not be game
My sister is having guests from her school coming in at 8
I mean if tonights game is an indepth review of the hydrosphere and biosphere, including the current pollutants associated with each, then Ill have to miss tonight
I cant play today
no
im good for it
give me a sec
mic is acting up
im pretty sure he nutpunched goro in the first movie
JOHNNY CAGE
whose claim to fame is getting punched in the nuts by the OBJECTIVELY best character in mk
goro is an mk character
we'll be trendy and say mars was exploiting children
how does this work
ohhhhhhhhhhh ive never reported anyone on skype
cease
idk where eric is
8ish?
Something
I can play
honestly I agree we ought to just wait a week
i fixed my problem
give me a sec
ok now my skype is busted
start the call and see who answers lol
so why would starting at 9 be any different
honestly what did you expect when he thinks he can start at 8 we wait til 9
hes not answering probably cuz hes workin
im ready to play rn
it wouldnt be workers comp but you know what i mean
also fr what fucking workers comp do you get for your rapidly changing schedule?
eric i would like to throw etan off a high surface
kevin is your skype workin now?
eggcellent. spread the plague
im already upset
Midterm next week and all
I can use the extra time
I thought not. It's not a story the Chemists would tell you. It's an Economics legend. The Commons was a peaceful land full of cows, so lush and so fecund that every farmer could graze their cows and create milk... The Commons had such rich resources that the farmers put out as many cows as they could. The Overcrowded Livestock is a pathway to many dairy products some consider to be... unnatural. They grazed so many cows... the only thing the farmers were afraid of was losing their cows, which eventually, of course, they did. Unfortunately, they exceeded the carrying capacity of the commons, then the cows died in their sleep. Ironic. They could save their bottom line from death... but not their cows.
MARS
 BLAME
yeah
OPA CYKA BLYAT
assuming same time this week right?
I am
The zealous martyr is praised for his valour: the craven and the unready are justly abhorred.
oh and heres a 40k quote
be ever vigilant
trust no-one
it is the ones that come masquerading as allies which are the most dangerous
enemies come in many forms
also mars poisoned a bunch of people. good job mars.
this is the completely unbiased recounting of what happened over the last two sessions
so they cant be good for us
also there are a bunch of bullshit runes somewhere in the city and we don't know what they do but the elf-witch wanted them there
and are getting ready to join the attack in whatever capacity the elf-witch deems us fit for
we then escaped the city
we poisoned the city wells, started a slave rebellion, and started a bit of political intrigue.
the elf-witch wanted us to sneak into the city we were attacking with magical disguises to spread around a bunch of magical tokens that did different things
I could try
fuckin heretic
I can dig it
sound pretty cool
are we game this week?
gj
youre lvl 7 now btw
im done with my work
gives me more time on what im doing
we can discuss the game when we're all here
atm im working on school work
Do not worry about it.
Not quite mentally deficient enough to be a kroxigor
Not quite mentally deficient enough to be a kroxigor
Skaven Master Race
I always saw vargach as a big orange saurus 
lol
dodge
just
i think we'll try it with who we have and if we feel like its not working we could find another person
I don't think we got around to that
No I cant
He’s bigger than me
He said yeah
I’m with Eric rn
and combat isnt the main thing with this dungeon i think there are only 2 fights in it
depending on how on the ball you guys are with the puzzles
should only be a bit over an hour long
its a simple and quick dungeon crawl of a dungeon i found on DM's Guild
kevin if youre interested im doing a oneshot with mars to try my hand at story telling
so ill probably be game for today
we don't usually do too much. just gifts and dinner then we forget about it
it is my moms birthday today so if we play today I might be late
I think it might have been a scheduling thing
that was unexpected
mhmmmm
and now mars as fancy bling on his hands that let him be even more heretical than he already is. 
so yall trampled around a giant temple to collect masks
I think I missed something
Umm
markus doesn't drink.
no ive got work to do fuck off eric
ash
be
to 
need
they
if anyone else gets in the way hold person. those books direct someone how to become a lich
if the bird gets in the way kill it
and burn them
find 2 books on her person
if alix dies before you resurrect her
also here's an important thing you have to do
he hates necromancy and not his ideas when it comes to afterlife
the god is Kelemvor
but I still don't think I should play because I probably have to study for my other final
and im done with it
so my final was actualy 4-7
ill add it in his sheet quickly before getting back to studying
to deny critical hits
its pretty easy but now that he's lvl 6 he wants to be 30 away from enemies
someone can play him
7-10 pm
yall have fun without me and don't die. or do.
so I wont be able to play this week
im in finals week and I have a final on saturday
well
riiiiiiiiiight
That's a grudgin'
ride the cat into battle
and yes. he would praise the fucking sun
the next best thing was playing a golden dragonborn paladin of pelor named Helios Aurelian
fuck you you cant stop me from finding my very own sun
I wanted the solar knight class so I could engage in jolly cooperation eric
headset problem probably
we all hear eachother
is your mic not working kevin?
?
should I bring my computer/
this shit shouldn't be seen as an obligation
I mean im all for taking a break for a week if some of you guys aren't up for tonight
that sounds like some folks wont be 100% when we play tonight
mars can tell you ALLLLLLLL about it
we only played one
don't worry
god damn you mars stop debating semantics with me an play league
god damn you mars stop debating semantics with me an play league
the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes
having to fucking play hotpotato with politics depending on who youre talking to
or maybe that's just a my family thing
my favorite color is purple anyways
to myself in the mirror I couldnt care less
to my aunt and uncle, im a republican. to my immediate family im a democrat
no worries mars. ive been experiencing cognitive dissonance when trying to maneuver the political landscape this thanksgiving
youre a rainbow of different kinds of dementia aren't you?
that would be your Alzheimer's acting up again
When mars said he saw a famous person at the bar he works at, I pressed him to determine if it was just another bout of early onset parkinson's
When mars said he saw a famous person at the bar he works at, I pressed him to determine if it was just another bout of early onset parkinson's
question the individual's mental stability. 
im good for it
very cool
thank you ubisoft
the ubishit special
ahhh yes
the story was retarded since the beginning
what
ummm
numbered games
anything beyond that is kinda… extra shit
tbh ac lore really only revolves along the first 3 games
alright
no wiki this is all from my own knowledge of stupid stuf
there might be spoilers
do you want me to explain everything I know?
THE TEMPLARS DID NOTHING WRONG
because spartans were the most subtle killers
ac odyssey
What fucking swine eats lobster in thanksgiving 
acquire thanks. deliver to others. mission success.
Like the path is too small or something
I feel like if you wanted to get rid of the cart you could just make it stuck in the forest
we just kept eviscerating him until someone finally noticed the gem  inside his body
in a campaign I was a part of we fought a troll who kept regenerating limbs until we cut out a magic artifact that was attached to the base of his spine
start counting rations without telling them
why is this so low res
roman names or bad
a normal person would see this as a transition from a conversation about food to pictures of cute dogs
popular meme
clerics are a great idea
how unfortunate.
character trait weak-willed
you probably want a good party comp or something
itll be greaaaaaaaaaat
if you do an interview ill zone of truth and we can ask the hard questions
have a panel with all of the pcs just fucking grilling these npcs
demand in game interviews
mars
I once saw a celestial warlock who rped a docter and his familiar was like his nurse
chain got good rp tho
5th
lol
since mars wont be receiving it ever again
keta how do you feel about being a target for the bless spell
I just wont heal you
this is honestly fine
it would be like if vargach wants to do A and tnesi wants to do B, you settle the dispute
I feel like the captain would be like the decisionist. basically solves ties if the party is split on what they want to do
have any of you guys seen anything from pennyarcade's acquisitions incorporated?
but it would probably have a bit of rp attached to it
the captain only has to micromanage npcs
newest to the group
I wont make for a good captain either
its magic and it needs no explanation
beyond that youre kinda obsene. shit you can do transcends human capabilities. (shut up I know half of it is magic)
youre a bonafide badass
by level 5 youre like Rambo and john wick
remember that at lvl 3 youre already a tough guy. youre like mel Gibson's character in lethal weapon
I don't think pc intelligence is even comparable to actual peoples intelligence
just gotta put shit in the chat so the damn picture leaves the fucking screen
youre an idiot
move
re
flip a coin
don't fucking start raving about absolver
and that's fine
the only dio song I know is holy diver
that was easy to answer
heavy squatting and Slavic magic
german science is ze best in ze worlt
oh right. opening fire on a vampire, sending it into a crowded cafe
we have castlevania for that now
well... gone is the anime about punching vampires with special breathing magic
this is fine
except rape... and murder...
FUNNY VALENTINE DID NOTHING WRONG
still not as self centered as johnny joestar
oh right. jotoro is a deadbeat dad
OK
they were like: we want a character whose like vito Corleone except more homoerotic
it doesn't have to make sense
and that's supposed to make up for rampant theft
and his heroic trait is... that he doesn't like drug trade
then we have fucking giorno whose fucking goal is to become a "gang-star"
joseph worked. jotoro was pushing the envelop
it worked for Johnathan had actual heroic qualities
as the series went on, the fucking protagonist got less and less... protagonist-like
honestly I couldn't watch part 5
the guy whose clothes look like fucking cheese?
he looked like old Indiana jones
or better yet, don't dress like that. the most sensible clothing a character had in jojo was joseph in stardust crusaders
pillar men? please. dress like a real man. dress like joseph from battle tendency
The epic victory royale 
Offer a great bounty to the last one standing
I can start any time
im here
that better?
there
game is hard dude
thanks dad for understanding
but i think i didn't stat him right
i mean i wanted my grimdark edgeboy to be good
leaves something to be desired to be certain
never played the class before i wanted to try it out
blood hunter eats damage like no one else
and i do have to say
i wouldn't if someone said no
I wanted to ask everyone if they were ok with me rerolling
APOCALYPSE
CHEESEBURGER
MAN
ONE
me and burger
and i was leaning toward making him act like the tf2 medic
the keep them from dying subclass
leaning towards grave cleric
i was thinking grave or tempest cleric
its ok just apologize to mars for his being born an idiot and move on
its not nice to make fun of people's disabilities keta
i figured if i got the ok from everyone then itll be ok
having me suddenly swap pcs every so often isnt something i want to keep doing its just i feel like we could really use it for the game to be more enjoyable
would everyone be ok if i rerolled my class to help get a better composition going?
every session we seem to be strung the fuck out on healing
also i wanted to ask everyone this
optimal
i assume we're good to go for tomorrow?
excellent choice
honestly probably the most optimal place for such a thing in the entire U.S.
Alaska is an optimal place to be mauled to death by a polar bear
rip your skin off?
you can dress for the cold. what the fuck are you going to do in California?
id rather be freezing that overheating
Just do it now
Would that mean you actively take fucks away?
we don't need that shit
take mask of many faces or youre playing the game wrong. agonizing blast is a vanity invocation
at least invocations are cool
and that'll tide me over for the next 8 hours ingame
the warlock state of mind is: ill cast hex
well other spellcasters have the spell slots to actually... play the game
2 cantrips a turn 8 rolls
mars eldritch machinegunner?
stabbing people with swords tho.
you cant describe to viewers or players black lightning arching out of a rock in many ways
and that's something we can all appreciate
at least fjord isn't a blastlock
AHAHAHAHAH
BUT ELDRITCH BLAST OR WHATEVER
its thematic to how they don't actually know magic or some shit idk
but if that shit isn't in most campaigns then well fuck 
its good for dungeon crawling
ha heyyyyyyyyyyy warlocks make me want to die
and the rest of the class makes them dogshit
good videos. I like to think I would do better in the situations he describes... I LIKE TO THINK THAT
puffin forest
oh and they were level 1
I watched a video where a guy talked about dming a 4 session long mission where the players weren't allowed to long rest
that's some serious hardcore mode
long rest is an in game week I think

and im willing to let it stay like that
I don't think anyone else in this party knows about gemi
good on us
so 
which is actually a step up from the typical composition of murderous racists and nymphomaniacs
I repeat myself. the party was made up of lunatic sycophants
we fucking used the favor the monster gave us to basically use it as a fucking taxi to the next town to impress the guards
eric your pcs were literally a roving band of sycophants who wanted to prove to everyone that they were hot shit
battlemaster assassin rogue is a dumb combo
which we barely managed to do despite giving our ranger/rogue hybrid like.... 3 free crits within the first combat round
for reference eric made us fight a homebrewed creature who was immune to arcane casting. the monster was way more powerful than us but all we had to do to "prove ourselves to it" was to beat it within a third of its life.
fun and didn't make me want to club my fucking head open with a stick
because that was fun
save for something homebrewed like a creature immune to fucking arcane casting
but I don't think dnd has too many rules about the casting type of spells unless im missing something
if I was running it I wouldn't CALL them divine casters, but id probably give them the same game rules as divine casters
whoever is running the game
up to interpretation
which is more in line with the rest of the themes of the classes
there once was another type of casting called "primal"
I think druids and rangers being given the title of divine casters is a relatively recent thing for dnd
unless that's like a character specific thing
I don't reckon rangers worship gods
that's from nature shit man. divine magic in my mind is that which is given to the caster from gods
nature magic is heresy. divine magic is where its at
either that or I can confirm my suspicions that druids are even worse than I thought
idk some dipshit bard thought a fucking tiger was looking really good
it depends on if the race has a stable genome that isn't to removed from humanity
cat people are debatably heresy
elves are heresy
demons are heresy
which have a statline similar to woodelves
cat people are tabaxi
rakshasa are demons
that statement is so stupid it stays stupid
and im not willing to do that again
we literally played dnd for like... 8 hours that day
game went on for too damn long
lawful good aasimar gotta keep those wings somehow
sounds like someone we know
oh? is the pathos there?
did you pull the punch?
empathy is defined as: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
even if they are trying to put forth a false impression
and being empathetic means youre more capable of discerning people's real meanings or feelings based on faces or words
out of 80
i take everything someone says or types literally because im that dumb
you have to remember that I got a 9 on that empathy test I took last quarter mars
Richard and Mortimer? why yes mars I was well aware of your powerful iq.
I mean it would have to be a simple thing right? shifting all numbers by 1 in a particular direction to spell out a proper question
even with whats given
I don't actually know how to get to that answer
fucking brilliant mars
… the answer eric gave us?
YOU DIE FIRST
no
i refuse to die first in a combat
but at the rate im working at, id reckon it wont be too long before I get another chance
character creation
i was excited I almost got to participate in my favorite part of dnd
but we shouldn't pay attention to that
which probably speaks to some deeper character flaw I have
than again every character I play ends up being a sarcastic, greedy, racist asshole
I mean it was for me
i thought it was a character thing
Dealing with rogues
because fuck demons
anyways hes an honorary grey knight imo
or I think they call him doom slayer or doom marine I forgot
the guy who mocapped for doomguy voices goblin slayer in the dub
is this like one of your senpais?
I have no idea what that means
FUCKING WOO he says. im not excited he says.
pst
murica west side
why are you excited? I know youre just gonna be late by like an hour no matter what time we set
roll a dice lol
dark heresy? good thing.... I got a flashlight
of all the black library books the gotrek and felix series is the least grimdark. horus heresy is pretty grimdark tho
nope
gotrek and felix has some funny parts in it too
either horus heresy for scifi or gotrek and felix for fantasy
for books you could look at black library
and crunch is actual game rules
fluff is lore shit if you didn't know that
id lean to mordenkains because its got some fluff in there, which i like.
but again xanathars or mordenkains
but anyways keta its up to what you want. you should look up what each book gives you and whichever sounds the most interesting to you pick it up
when i was playing at aero hobbies
when i was home yes
i did
also I bought my book to support my local gamestore since im not a fucking drain on society mars
idk I like having physical copies
personally id go with either xanathars or mordenkains
theres also the monster manual which gives you a bunch of monster stats, which is good for dms
also I made a mistake the elf and teifling subraces come from mordenkain's tome of foes
with the phb+1 book rule
I assumed this was for adventurers league
and a bunch of new subclasses
xanathars gives you a bunch of elf and tiefling subraces
what do you want, because each book is different
im assuming we're set for tomorrow normal time yes?
calm thyself
he goes to public school and doesn't own a car eric
oy vey my tax bracket
Y I K E S
well now hes as old as I am
I agree
this is true
yes
sam riegel from critical role?
i have an intuition
she cannot yell without a tongue
that is unnecessary
zzzzZZZZZZZOOOOoooooommmmmm
and yeah I think we're go for 8
when we get started ill tell you guys a funny story that happened which is related to this
I have no idea what that means
ill be honest man
Since Eric never said that we’re changing times I’m assuming we’re good for the same time this week?
then... that's all the reason he needs to not go
you could just... go on your fucking date
all the same I can start early or end early
this is a thing that happens
people get better overnight
claim to be sick? idk about you but half the college in sb are practically coughing their guts out rn.
I found this on the internet
voice only
I don't want to have to shave
so I wouldn't bother with marking xp
that's how the last few went I think
its not about beating high cr shit
I think were doing xp differently
8pst
if mars calls the group, which will happen, don't answer it
commit this to memory everyone
mars youre so full of shit
idk what yall are working with i just did 2 paragraphs
i didn't go too in depth idk if eric needs more ill give him more when he needs it
I finished mine a while ago
im saying all this before eric just comes on and calls me an idiot for passing bullshit info
so id reckon session 1 proper
also there was a doc he put out on more themed lore shit which was linked in that reddit post
I think any intro for backstory and all that should be given to you in the handouts he has put on r20
yes
yes
yes
yes
what
attack spells will automatically be put in your attack tab
 if its in the I tab, you can drag it into your spell list
which would provide good contrast for other characters
it would make sense for you to go about life in a naïve way
a cyclonic torpedo is already on its way. enjoy exterminates heretic.
XENOS.
THE.
ABHOR.
abhor the xenos
human best race
heresy
lest you be disappointed that you cant play your lunatic machine worshipping metal man from mars
get the ok from the dm before you set your heart into anything
i could be wrong i have no idea
I may be mistaken sam but I remember saying you wanted to be the cleric
metamagic two eldritch blasts
he told me he was going to do that dumb sorc warlock multiclass that I told him about
and a cleric
to answer your question sam I think we have a fighter, a wizard
no worries it took us a little bit to get r20
and swords weigh 9. its not supposed to makes sense
do you look up items in the tab marked with an I and drag the items and spells you want into the character sheet?
in his words, he will let you play anything that isn't outlandish
or so he has told me
he is eating
I believe we are rolling stats
as of yet
there is no mess
no you did not
theyre supposed to be from another realm or something. came to this one. found angry gods enslaving everyone. and decided not to be down with it
dude everyones backstory is just: Was slave, now not slave, now jungle fighter
no just a character motivation
my character wants to never die
people die twice. once when they stop breathing and a second time when the last memory of their existence dies.
oh I actually have it
in the grim darkness of the far past everything is shit
which I am having difficulties with
ive been specially directed to not make an edgy backstory
maybe earlier and have us play on the day of
well id figure that the dm will walk us through CC saturday
i have a prestigious collection of plastic dudesmen
I like rolling many dice.
Im leaning towards being a fighter
is that in the UA?
I don't recognize that class
do yall know what you plan on playing when we get to it?
so easily you tell him to fuck off
how many folks did you find?
the other two are mute as per usual
I don't think anyone is here lol
or yall are really using up those 2 minutes
I think everyone is asleep
One hangover more than enough then?
Unless mars plans on being shitfaced again tomorrow 
We’re all good for tomorrow right?
don't fucking get me killed again
I don't have an idea for a next character you dingus
technically it works out lol
What was the last thing you remember being awake for atlas?
we'll see if they show up
just making sure we're all good for 8pm
so youre saying you basically built your character to be antagonizing
I haven't learned how to sell my soul at a premium
I didn't tell her that
we're all good guys here
while he isn't looking
unfortunately i am white so i wouldn't get away with it ill be slapped by the pc police
didn't he fuck off to his own planet of clones
and that's normal
ok so he tries to pin murdering the fire lady on us but we stopped it and saved her and now we're on our way out of the city
mars isn't a necessity. as can be seen from the last two weeks
he was a goodboy amongst psychos I don't think it would be conceivable to play a character like that
So I found out I’m good for tomorrow
we cant hear you
if youre talking
nope he was part of it
we did violently butcher 20 farmsworth of peasents
shouldn't be any problem for us
well... we already have experience purging the weak grim
so that is something I intend to acquire
but she needs souls
and feel that I will play the character far tamer than mars would
I resent that statement
have we decided if we're waiting for mars?
if youre seated why are you fucking talking to us
I want to stab everyone and gut them like fishes to see how they work on their insides
to saying he will be late
goes from wanting to start early
acquire souls get shiny stabby bits
not so much
spell saves umm
his ac is good
nope my ring
thus is the pact
now you want it
you put a ring on it
now?
umm
since mars isn't at work?
we wanted to start early this week no?
because that's retarded
silence isn't giving the affirmative
that isn't a thing
we had 3 last week as well tho no?
nobody saying anything
that would require me to transcend my physical and mental limitations to become the perfect being
I could never be as gay, black, or fat as sky
Your dementia is great at making cyphers mars
As I am enjoying a meal at fatburger I don’t have much recourse but to agree
You’re dumb
didn't see that coming
tomorrow means sunday?
Are we game this week?
im good for it
Not to mention they are on another fucking continent
But the thing is we probably didn’t have the hardware to get the damn things
I mean ofc it was
Purple= gives you tits and and kills you again
Green= plant monster
Edited previous message: I think we're almost game
I think we're almost gamer
stop
workibg: already started drinking
get that money for those sandwiches
good
go to work
mars
a scholar amongst his people?
I would like to molest a homeless man to find the "evil"
oh and does our paladin know he got a new toy without having to do anything?
trust me everyone just don't ask questions and hate him
but its ok to hate him
no one knows who that is
so needy
im good
ahahahahhahahHAHAHAH
we could just take a break one week
is this shift for this week or from now on?
tough
this is the part where you tell us right?
^good Persian food
^bad Persian food
im good
pull down your hoodie and leave the Arizona at work
I DONT CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARE
why do you bother explaining this to him you know he wont ever admit to anything
no ask milo
and 401k
take advantage of your sick pension
how bout just quit mars
123
party tension aside
did yall enjoy session 2?
bwaahhhhh
grim is your connection alright?
i don't comprehend that
no
lol?
umm
Ok 
Om
I got off late at work
Are we in?
Umm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmok
yes
assuming I get off at when im supposed to
but I will probably want to die
ill still make it at 8
and its supposed to be a bad schedule
I am working this saturday
have we got another time?
go back to cryostasis we cant have you thaw out now and start coughing
I’m pretty sure we’re good to go
I as a person do not comprehend the idea that there is such a thing as AM
I wont work this Saturday so any time is good for me
he only has one gear and that is to drive into a wall.
I did like it when someone who had 6 dex wrote into his backstory that he was hit in the leg during a fight which never fully healed
how the pc carries itself shouldn't be affected by stats.
yet the barb still talked and acted like an idiot
we had a barbarian with higher int then the warlock
I always thought statlines shouldn't affect how you rp a character
did we have a time for our first game?
im not working today
also eat shit mars
I woke up 20 min ago. give me a break
she was at milos party
its a socal thing I think
and actually start next week
I think we should all just group up for the character creation this week
Edited previous message: 
are they on the r20?
so I have seen.
oh no wait I think Saturday still doesn't work for eric
shit
umm
oh
but I think sunday works for eric, mars, and myself.
but I think at that point mars is just starting his job. Im pst
im working this Saturday til 5 (assuming no overtime)
that depends on scheduling right?
ehh
the druid
we met one
dont be so prejudiced
heretics
meaning you have a lore-fitting reason to pick up that race
goliaths live up there
also goliaths
if you do you should also know a little something something about the north
in the first campaign I made a dex fighter battlemaster
thanks for saving me multiple times with it btw
lol mars built his character on one of the worst feats in the game
im an edgy underdark ranger. i shoot people real good. for the first round of combat. then im just worse then all the other archtypes.
no whammies?
it should be mentioned that mars and i rolled for stats. i don't know if eric expects you to do the same so...
kidnapped... right... our first major mission was to fucking murder a child who was rumored to have magical powers for this country's version of the police (Justicars are angry paladins who are pricks.)
and the like
dragonborn
i know dwarves exist
umm... questions for eric. I mean elves were supposed to not exist but my character is muckin about. if you do pick one of the weirder races you might want to keep it hidden from npcs and even other players as to prevent your untimely and very bloody demise
and now I hope I didn't scare any of you with that lore dump
oh and eric apparently ranger magic is under the divine tag. which is why its dumb.
SUNLIGHT FOR LIFE
because they suck
they are a bunch of HERETICS and they come down south to raid and pillage and other barbarous things that people who don't worship the son do.
and lastly, to the north there exists another country called velarn I think. I forgot its name.
these items are sought after by the princes and nobles of the kingdom, and they frequently war with one another to acquire more
weapons and armor that basically turn their wearers into veritable demigods on the battlefield
and the last two major worldbuilding bits are that, in this setting, there exists extremely powerful artifacts called dawnblades and dawnplate
but that last one is dumb
this doesn't include magic that comes from gods, like paladins, clerics, and TECHNICALLY rangers
commoners who are shown to have some magical prowess and aren't good at keeping them hidden usually disappear as the higher class wants to keep up the idea that only nobles have the capability to cast magic
arcanist magic like wizardry, sorcery, and the like are considered to be exclusively available to nobility
that isn't to say elves don't exist in the setting, as im playing a drow
elves have been gone from this place for several thousand years, and the humans in this region believe that elves used to enslave all other races.
its a human kingdom, with some slight tendencies toward xenophobia
alright
I know a bit about the setting as well, if you want me to try to explain it alongside you eric
yes
yes
Im Michael im also in the game
well done
ill rip your head off
do you want to simply say we got the fuck out of there?
Edited previous message: shouldn't we give them some time before we start? in addition we haven't heard from all 4 of them
shouldn't we give them some time before we start? in addition we haven't heard from all 3 of them
it was for a time
I mean if youre not having fun that's reason enough to stop
neutral means...?
give me some leeway
so
but anyways ive gotten like. 2 hours of sleep in the last two days im not 100% here
hey jett are you feeling the same way?
so I will
I could
or not. idk
id reckon that means jett is out as well
O O F
im ok with early
we die
that does work for me as im working Saturday this week
yall have a time in mind for this week or do you want to play camp pain another time?
faded into the ether
then they disappeared
welp
multiple personality disorder
I misread ducheys as douchys
also that questionmark means?
did you ever describe whats to our east or is it the same as whats in the north
End my suffering
maybe he locked himself out again
despite the time being set by the person who isn't here
I think we're not gonna do campaign today
I don't think milo is here either
I guess I should have bet on everyone else for wholefoods
yes
Whole paycheck 
mars
that works for me
and apparently jetts silence means yes. and ill never get used to that
mars?
sounds like sunday is the best for three of us
I don't have to get her anything right?

yo dawg I heard you like raging
:/
We’re still expecting payday from the prince
My net worth has just been gutted
say hi
were in call with you man
i don't see you on r20
I’ll be on time
Wholefoods has been cancelled
I may be wholefoods 
I expect 6 pm
I eat like a normal fucking person
eat
to
need
we
to fucking eat
to eat mars
MARS
so id reckon we would go there because SOMEONE INSISTS THAT WE LIVE ON THE CHEAP
as for any other introductions idk maybe have it organic
its a cornerstone in my backstory to know mars
or would we simply get introduced to them in the town
should we include how we know the other 2 folks?
neither did i
do we want to rework backstory mars to accommodate this most recent change?
we are going light on them heals then. don't get hit everybody
we have a fighter, a rogue, and a ranger
mars im worried
and I thought we said sunday
you know that is essentially wholefoods
we really need to cast a wide net huh?
yall think about 5 or 6pm would be good?
sunday I think everyone has got something going on for the first few hours of the day
or sunday
on monday
time idk
incredibles Monday
we should wait for eric and see what he has to day on this matter
fathers day in my family is usually a single meal thing
as am i
and i can do sunday
if we have to delay dnd the next day im available is thursday
i cannot do tuseday
that hasn't always been true
idk about mars or jett
i think eric said yes
I said I could, as did you
im not even sure if everyone confirmed for monday
I assumed so
does uti's arrival mean were not game Monday?
milo
in other words im asking about dnd
I have this week off before I start working
he did
and I can play anytime now
im home
The best part is no one is gonna see it too
I knew that mang
… or are they both the same
in which case whats the name of the princedom?
unless that's his name
I don't think you included the name of the prince of aleese
q
what kind of racist shit is that
you kinda just don't let them into your island
they are slaves.
I mean so am I but at least my culture has a place for foreigners.
OH NO HES A FOREIGNER
or maybe that's just me
and would know LESS than them
tbh some of us aren't normal citizens
idk maybe some travelling ronin and he can name drop some  places we haven't been to
i have no clue what milo is planning with his backstory except he knows Lysandre somehow
speaking of which I have no clue what that is
that's a thing you should do at home, especially since it doesn't pertain to the current path the party is going
if i had to guess, he wanted to draw dicks on it
did it work?
that's the best i got man
i can use the snipping tool but it will be super low res
so if it was retrievable somewhere else on my computer i can post it here and you can have it that way
i think its not a file you can retrieve unless it is actually posted into a chat
I tried to do something similar with a skype icon and I couldn't figure it out
how much bling will jett have
id figure its lost to us
the ring idk jett didn't specifically say he took it
it was a pact sword, which disappears when I die or after 1 min more than 5ft away from me
the sword goes away when I do
well that was pointless
im playing tw so I should be good to go at any time
so we all good for tomorrow at 7 right?
and its not working imo
the system isn't meant to be realistic its mean to be fun
im just saying the system itself isn't accomplishing what it was meant to do now
im not ragging on you jett
ik now it feels more like an annoyance and less like something we have to even consider
if im being honest any and all difficulty with it vanished the moment jett realized he could break the system with purify food and water
since we're planning on playing Friday I figured I would ask how everyone liked the travelling system eric cooked up
what
umm
thats Texan textbooks' job
youre being dumb and now im going to stop talking and do my homework
so that means you can right?
you didn't fucking mention it
can you play right now?
how about today then?
that doesn't mean than any other day is fine
thats retarded
that's retarded
Edited previous message: nor did we hear anything from jett relating to friday

im going for you
that's retarded
im not going to your birthday for them milo
also damnit milo when is your fakkin party
I remember that sunday was our first option then something came up

but as it is unreliable I don't think we should schedule around that
usually we leave at about 3 and get there at 6ish
which varies when they have time
when my parents decide to drive me
ITS NOT WORTH IT
MARS
mars
mars
as far as rescheduling goes
but id like to wait and see what others have to say
we are by no means obligated to play this weekend
and do it later
we could just delay
to dodge your work
or earlier
we could start later on sunday
we could ummm
long shift or something?
why does sun not work for you again mars?
its honestly just sat and sun for me
or monday
but not early friday
so the entire weekend I'm free
umm
in which case the compendium is probably enough
unless youre not a spellcaster
well
if you want to see more indepth options available you have to use another site
which is like... their best spell
they don't even have warlock hex
if you only use r20 compendium you don't get all the options
Edited previous message: its more annoying when picking new spells on level up
its more annoying when picking new spells on level p
id like to read it too
?
link
you cant drag on from the compendium since you didn't buy it
whoever wants to turn it on can
I honestly think the facecams will be enough imo
reveal wont have an impact
your WOWZERS SHES A GRIL
you could honestly just play that character
Bs I'm not racist
SHE DEAD NIBBA
Edited previous message: idk it adds more flavor
idk it adds more flaver
so we can see expressions and gestures
how about facecam next time we do dnd
but they are all Warhammer shit
honestly I have a metric fuckton of minis
damb
do you want to actually do an irl thing and actually be in the same room and roll real dice
so since I'm gonna be in santa monica next week when we are doing dnd
it was a joke
its not happening tomorrow
just because you are amongst retards doesn't mean you have to become retarded to match them
proper diction is important
autistic*
MAAAAAAAAAAARS?
MARS?
MARS?
RIGHT
so were playing tomorrow right mars?
MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARS

Shadar-kai look like bondage gimps

Edited previous message: so sunday is actually viable for me
so sunday is actually viable fo rme
Monday I'm off from school
at like... 7ish
so are we in it for Friday?
well that's the thing isn't it we're doing just that
but would yall be ok with playing late night?
i mean i can play
ish
Friday i will be in a car until like.... 7
idk ill wait for others to put forth ideas
sunday perhaps
maybe later that weekend
we could play a later time
all the same
and i saw it on my way to the party
i remember because there was a car accident on montana that day
I remember he had one last year
wowie no party? what is he? me?
he didn't invite me :p
I wouldn't know
I'm back home for that
are we good for then?
next weekend is memorial day weekend
so this weekend is out
idk
umm
so monk bullshit gives you 2 perception?
I bet its because YOURE A HERETIC
is this a monk thing
how do you have 15 passive perception with only 14 wis and no profeciency
I'm at 13
wait for real ik someone has passive perception higher than mine
proficiency in perception?
lul
keen mind at 8 int
I have magic bullshit eyes but they only work at night so idk how helpful I would be for any of these tasks
Not to mention that we already have a map
5 duties and only 4 people to do them
Or you get cholera
Mars roll constitution save
And see how frustrated we get
All the same we’re on the road next session so let’s try Eric’s prepare to die mode
Goodberry actually does hydrate you
I’m down to try Eric’s hardcore mode for a session before I make a choice on wether I like it or not
Because casting is BALANCED 
And besides warlock and pally aren’t offered it so we will never have to deal with it
Then honestly it’s balanced
Goodberry is fine if you make it consume materials
I need my NUTRITION 
Mars my nutrients are in those açaí berries
MAAAARS we don’t have goodberry to ez mode that shit
bs I'm not racist
nibba ask him
so the earliest I can play idk about him is the next coming saturday
I have midterms
jett has prom
jett and I cannot play this saturday
no time WERE KILLING ORKS
MAGICAL HORSESHIT FUCKING WITH MY ASTRONOMY
SILENCE HERETIC I WONT HEAR IT FROM YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
he had 8
WHAT KIND OF BARBARIAN ARE YOU
YOU WERE SPEAKING USING PROPER DICTION
I thought you showed yourself not to be retarded
we were all exposed to your unrepentant heresy
EXCUSES
EXCUSES
in a really dumb way
you said it
what time saturday
ok
so your confusion is understandible
i also remember it not being spoken in your presence
I remember that
it was spoken
internet back
My school internet is down
Well
Me ok with today as well
Me want Saturday 
then we wait I guess until one or both of them have rekindled interest
so do you want to play before then or not until then
main just isn't happening for a minimum of half a month
in full
I thought you were ok with running minis until we get back
the fact of the matter is we don't know when THEY want to play
they both said no man
so you said this weekend or next eric?
what
umm
I can play then
ill be home next week
they don't have a time planned
that's just the issue
I'm dead inside and will now retire
also its 3
hey eric whats youre opinion on doing one offs or a minor campaign until all the boys are ready to play the main thing again?
do we even have plans for restarting?
isn't it the best time
i think everyone is going to
ehh
so
well campaign is as of now on hiatus seemingly indefinitely so by the time we start nobody is gonna remember shit
maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan who cares
fuckin mars said nobody would notice
NO PUSSY GO IN
yes
yes
everyone
hey how do yall feel about me playing an oathbreaker?
why he no say words
isn't he in this skype?
I am surprised he wanted to play
yes
i was about to say Philip and miles
i would rather not play at all
i will say this outright rn
doubtful

I would rather not do Thursday as well

yes
I cannot do sunday
we could do that morning thing we did last time
or thurs
probably saturday
so
I'm assuming were doing mars on friday
yes
which means hes leaning towards something else
he said that's the most castery he would get
then what you got planned?
if no caster
you right gemi best waifu
because eric overtuned his waifu to be too stronge
6 til we tpk?
well the build is going to be battlemaster fighter with sword and board
well if everyone is rerolling no one can fucking make fun of me for making a new character
other than erics power fantasy for his waifu

DRAKKI BEST TANK

well
I would like to wait for 4:20 on the dot as my roommate is asleep and I'm working on something
im studying until were ready
I'm here
which is good
phys is last
which is gay
fucking ochem is first
mon tuse wed
Saturday 11-2 I'm in review session for ochem
so we can tally it all up to cowardice, weakness, and stupidity
well it looks like you misspelled weakness as well
it only takes 3 minutes to expose your cowardice
I could do 3 hours but 5 seems much
as I'm on the fence about playing as well
if hes out I think It would be best to delay
I was just talking to milo and he was unsure if he can do it
it has to be after 3
if I do
what time?
I just don't want to lose a whole day doing campaign
but I can take breaks
chem
yall can play thurs w/out me
all the same
I do not agree
suck
quarters
again
for yall maybe
or just week before finals week
not no class
dead week means nothing new in lecture
WHICH IS IN 5 FUCKING DAYS
and in DEADWEEK we are learning things in lecture for the FUCKING FINAL
because you didn't have midterms week 8 of fucking 9
because youre not in quarter system
you don't have anywhere NEAR as many tests
DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND WHAT BULLSHIT IM GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW
YES
YES
YES
but I cannot play this week
yall can do without me
no
ummm
I'm in deadweek man
this Thursday or next
ill be honest I was expecting a response
yes?
umm
wryyyy
better spoke than typed
get me in there I got a story
what are yall in call or something?
fuck you what the hell is red herring
IS ROOK
WHO THE FUCK
WHO THE FUCK IS ROOK MARS
MARS
mars
mars
when are we getting our gun stats
hey
hey mars
cease
no shit
so yea
[8:55:02 PM] Eric Huang: just like
you know

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
I mean the post was followed by
you FOOL
its meant to be targetted
krappa
have him be immensely stupid
he deader than the fucking dcu
nibba he dead
so I'm good
well
he is already super dead and in 2 pieces rn
fucking put up
i dont
if its not magic i can beat anyone ANYONE
real shit square up thot ill beat him down at any level
hoe put up I'm not scurred
and i would have won harder
he wouldn't be able to keep me out of his range then, which means his retarded cheese strat wouldn't have worked
but with boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooows
its the SAME THING
do you know what great weapon mastery is?
did you finally close eluras milo?
which is why shooting ppl with advantage on them is like.. important or something
but since everything has like 19 ac, hitting is kinda hard
you get to not suck
if you weren't dumb like me and didn't take crossbow expert, instead opting to use that shit on a bow,
its not fair but it does require you to use the sharpshooter fighter archetype
but with a -5 to hit
at fighter level 10 those in combination give me a 22 damage mod
steady aim and sharpshooter
that's because youre racist
well
on Jamaica avenue?
what?
that pescado smell
oh wait i got that taco smell
I'm at the taco bell
Edited previous message: i got that pizza butt
i got that pizza but
I got that pizza gut
I'm at the pizza hut

Confirmed boys it DOESNT MEAN ANYTHING 
don't know what that means
i
in gilderion
theres no fucking h
that's wrong
umm
gilderion is just a false flag
his real name is rook
I think
BIGGUS DICKUS
was
his name
and so is milo
oh hey eric is back
ROOK
IS
FUCK
THE
WHO
but the real question is
heresy
where did mars go again?
your heresy will not go unpunished
maybe too much red for him to see
I think
before he died
I mean I showed him the sunset
strategy is the fanciest way to say cowardice
he never did more than 7 damage in a single attack
he did 80 damage in poking and proding
I was at 1/3
who is he?
but dey don' know. dat de cleva, GET DA CLEAVA!
and I'm not
but hes dead
many coward think they are clever
but he just coward
manswine thought himself clever
its ok
negative
define
we all have to prepare something to say?
?
i wanted to rename all your planets to dumb shit
I cant edit it
did we even all agree to do this one Friday?
no?
umm
so we're not doing this one on Friday as we are going to make characters for mars' space murder adventure?
and if I do Friday it has to be later in the day
so I'm not doing thurs
at 2-3
midterm friday
its just one legendary resist man
resistant to everything but psychic wut?
SHE'Z DA 'ARD UN
YOOZ GOTZ ONE OF DEM DEMON FINGS IN YA 'EAD
YOOZ NOT 'ARD YAH GIT
and homeboy was like no I don't like you get fucked
he wanted to be teleported somewhere
and you would have actually gotten to see your mom
maybe you should have chilled that murderboner for like idk 3 fucking days
ordo malleus will do in a pinch
preferably ordo hereticus
contact your nearest inquisitor
sounds heretical
see a physician
CONTROL YOUR HORMONES

you can cleave your head from your body
BLOOD FOR KHORNE
which means they die
they bleed
youre a heretic
well
then just this
[10:37:12 PM] Parsa Jour: Courage is fighting the kingdom which enslaves you, no matter that their armies outnumber yours by ten-thousand to one. You know nothing of courage. Honour is resisting a tyrant when all others suckle and grow fat on the hypocrisy he feeds them. You know nothing of honour.

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
better quote
Which one of us inherited a strong, cultured kingdom? And which one of us had to rise up against a kingdom with nothing but a horde of starving slaves? Which one of us was a child enslaved on a world of monsters, with his brain cut up by carving knives? Listen to your blue-clad wretches yelling of courage and honour, courage and honour, courage and honour. Do you even know the meaning of those words? Courage is fighting the kingdom which enslaves you, no matter that their armies outnumber yours by ten-thousand to one. You know nothing of courage. Honour is resisting a tyrant when all others suckle and grow fat on the hypocrisy he feeds them. You know nothing of honour.
an elf is born when two men touch tips
theres a giant golden-armored human I would like you to meet
the true inheritors of the world claimed what was rightfully theirs
twas not heresy, but manifest destiny
he need not know what heresy was conducted
ABSOLUTELY HERETICAL
how heretical
and you didn't put the vile witches to the torch
the only one ive seen in character is that steward
because I CANT FUCKING TELL
we have to do a perception check to see what gender it is
also yeah I think whenever we encounter an elf
Brother Mars. Lay the emperor's beat on this heretic
I'm all for virus bombing craftworlds
its ok when we purge filthy xenos
desire to purge increases
then it is subhuman
is it not human?
yes
I'm not sure what that is
he needs to know what the fuck do yall do
how terrifying
stahp
and I will not stop saying that its dumb
but really the fucking super saiyan thing hes got going on is fucking dumb
couldn't have said it better myself
PULLING A FUCKIN' JETT?
10 minutes late
enjoy
meanwhile hes hiding behind a rock jerking himself offf
he knocks ppl prone
i did just make him a tank for me

any bibbas in the chat
rood
wot
like the area one certain partymember is standing
hey eric is there a way to counterspell a fireball in such a way that it only hits like... a particular area
honestly raising him as a zombie doesn't seem like there would be much difference
HAHHHHHHHHHHH goteem
you mean play like AN ENORMOUS PUSSY
reaching critical mass
murderous intent rising
I for one welcome our imperial overlords

and I think miles is shitposting in the other chat
you know I am
well
Ave Imperator
so just pretend
but I don't have teeth
if I could bare teeth and sneer scram I would
I could attune the robes to make 3
yeah only 2 items
but ill check
the amulet and staff
I think I've got 2
and why it works
and also the mind reading ought to give pravaal insight on why what I'm saying is right
doesn't the staff give the user an understanding of all magic
meaning that they actually have an understanding of spells and magic, unlike warlocks who are gifted the power and sorcerers who are just... kinda good at what they do even though they have no fucking clue how they do it
as their shit is in a spell book
i think wizards ought to be the best suited for that
cant I teach spells?
soz
i would rather make a spooky scary skeleton than a league streamer
as in I learned nothing because devil magic ate my memory
it told me to fuck off
however fucking long that will take
I'm just gonna go ahead and add all compendium spells
oh miles did we tell you youre lvl 8 now?
look upon the heart?
no
bruh
mars we can hear your breathing
in other words. no more shopping campaign until after we kill things in the cave
we'z not in da' keep no more boyz. WE'Z GOIN' AFTER DAT MONSTA' IN DA CAVE

I think its boah
I'm not sure how to spell boy with a southern twang
DONT COME AT ME WITH THAT "BIG GAY" BOAH
itll be like being a cave troll being a prick to 4 helpless idiots on the internet
just cover yourself and the screen with a  blanket and itll be good
idk
also I feel like with my mic yall might hear eric
ill be able to cheat like hell
is mars ok with that?
tell the other guys to fuck off for tomorrow
but really are we doing this one or yours milo?
how bad can it be? he says before CHAOS INVADES

right whatever
riiiiiiiiight. yeah there are a lot of rapes to keep track of

I just watched the games ending
wait
and they made a joke out of it
and people thought it was a place
instead of boreale, he said BOREALUM
there is a game where a voice actor who had a funny voice said his characters name wrong
BOREALUM
