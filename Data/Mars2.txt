i want that
wtf
or access all that data?
your program can read all those messages though?
that was around the major skype update
fucking 11/10 idea
and then it will take over the world
it will be an absolute genius
you'll make the spergiest ai ever
amazing
thats
oh my fuck
LOL
but lets play a few rounds and see if it won’t shit itself and die
ngl, rn my connection is about 30 times worse than it normally is
aight gimme a sec to get some water
or so
im down in an hour
i just got this
?
that works
lmfao
Buy more skins faggot.

❤️ Riot.
Your Azir is dog-tier.

❤️ Riot.
can you base it on what champion he’s playing?
Are you trying to fuck with him or make him feel like riot loves him?
im outside
busy
fuck november i just want september
very cool
well he's on the 5th draft
his progress tracker thing is actually very cool
oh i hadn't ever seen sanderson's website since then
damn
second was skybreaker by 1 point?
but i's probably cause i memed some answers and put them at 100 when they werent
i was fully expecting windrunner ngl
my second best was windrunner
nigga i just said that
the gayest one, feelsbad
xd
lightweaver
what'd you get
alright
sure
i missed that last night
oh
eh idk who is
oh sweet
yeah
and i'll build my character accordingly
if you're running a game set it where you want
no clue
cause those are really the only two options worth a damn
and go into cs
or get motivated enough about money to actually learn to code or something
he's just gotta figure out what he likes enough to do and do that
i've tried to have this talk with him before but he was not agreeable to it then and i doubt much has changed.
probably adds up to a massive storm of "wow this shit sucks."
cause even jett's in there fuckin getting high and working out.
and there's nothing and nobody around to like distract him from these facts
so when people talk about self improvement during the quarantine, and he realizes he's just been playing videogames and reading summoner's war chat
anything he's passionate about to work on
im assuming milo wouldn't like it because of the friend thing and the fact that he doesn't have like
parsa wouldn't like it because his school is just shitting in his mouth
which im assuming is what he really wants
he just can't go outside and hang with friends
he can totally just go outside
and i think milo's missing the point
wtf is there not to like
and the govt gives me free money
i don't have to do shit
quarantine is the best
cause like i can see the signs clear as day, but 
like himself?
did milo say he has depression?
i see
as in miles is dm?
wants to run a game?
feels bad that i didn't get to play battlefield control wizard
i was gonna do that in yours
we've yet to play a game with a wizard that has been played right
a metal staff/wand maybe
atium does rival 9th level spells
oh you know what
something to rival 9th level spells
i'd give him a better capstone
especiallly at later levels
like
imo it's more like if this guy was in a party with a wizard he's gonna have to put up with major penis envy
you rarely see that come out of homebrew
which is cool
all in all, just looking at it i'd say the class is underpowered though
yeah, that seems like a way lower level ability
aside from that it's fine
which is kinda weird
on a hexblade
its like better bard skills
i think rioter and soother specifically are a little unbalanced
actually they're just slightly more limited than warlock spellslots
and those are severely limited
flares and surges are like actual spells
i mean it's invocation damage for the most part so it makes sense
spell slots are big gay
so long as you take short rests you've got power all day long
that's warlock for you
but i like warlock tier
i'd say it's definitely a warlock-tier class
and by sorcerers
they're outclassed in utility by wizards
but damage isn't everything
their damage potential is dog-tier without magic items
they're more annoying than anything
super strong
well i can't say it's like
*lot
but still that's asking a fucking lt
he'd have to jump like 10 feet
he wouldn't need to jump 20 feet to hit you 
and doesn't stay static at 10 feet
but your jump goes to 20 feet at level 5
and fuckin slap you
im saying he can jump up there
oh
his strength is gonna be ridic
but he's a barbarian
you can sorta hover out of range
yeah
not at level 5
because you can barely hit him
i mean i think fighting a 100hp barbarian as a party of allomancers would be a really interesting bossfight
it's target enemy control
battlefield control
and the thing is the utility isn't like
we need less damage in the game
kind of like that
yeah i actually
and at that point the options are tied
sorry 17
until level 14
so assuming you don't roll hot garbage and you get 5 in either str or dex then hitting them with your stick will be an objectively better option
yeah you get rapiers and longswords
oh yeah i see
it seems like allomancer is a melee focused support class
it doesn't look like coinshot does any damage?
yeah i can see that
fuck coinshot its an objectively worse option
you get medium armor
since the progression isn't tied to stats
double dipping doesn't matter
i mean you still get to use allomancy since
your main stat is whatever weapon you choose
a physical stat monster, specifically
but that means that lategame you'll be a monster
it means your progression is fixed and scales according to the game
since it means you don't have to sacrifice stats in other areas in order to focus on being good at the thing that your class was designed around
im not sure i actually like the allomantic ability modifier thing
hmm
no
i can barely read it tbh
brandon sanderson and his convoluted ass magic systems strike again
the main chat?
frankly it's incredibly gay
they're exacerbating the existing situation with their greed and their chimpness
like i give a fuck about george floyd
why do all these niggas think im the one out here looting
was just outside
today
lul
what the fuck ever
but
i told her that was not cool
landlady's been bringing in people to check out the rooms literally every other day
ngl i wouldn't come within 40 feet of this place
it really wasn't parsa this whole time
yeah
at least since before 4pm
i'm actually 100% sure that milo was stewing on this for hours
oh
*fellowship
run it for your friends
and that's that
i've decided that im not gonna care if they're not gonna care
and this is the third time it's happened in 3 weeks
every time it happens
every time it happens
this shit puts a massive cork on my fucking day
yeah lets go
Was making dinner
i mean in person
i don't mean in games
fucking hilarious
it's
tbh i fucking really enjoy seeing him get mad
My enjoyment isn't really dependent on what they're doing. Though, personally, I do like parsa being there, just cause his dumb fire and vitriol for no good reason thing doesn't bother me.
im a self-centered motherfucker
idgaf what they do
my take?
that's my primary method of communication with girls and it works
xd
and then message an ^ in the morning or something
but might as well leave them a wall of text that they cant reply to
they're definitely not awake
i meaan
do it
regardless
he was alright. i have way less problems with him than i do with anything else
nevermind
hm
and i was playing the most dickheadish character
i mean all of us were playing dickhead characters
is that he's hm
my one problem as a player with collin 
but jett doesn't give a fuck in general so
neither does jett
miles doesn't give a single fuck about them
it doesn't solve the townspeople thing
and im gonna give them some reason to care about the townspeople
im just gonna make them flesh out their backstories more
it's not like a negotiable thing, you're the dm you choose who plays in your game.
"I can't run with parsa in the party, so im gonna kick him out again, sorry."
just say
that i noticed really needed to happen
because im gonna do two things
let me run 1 session
and we can't rely on milo to tard wrangle jett cause a milo doesn't want to. and b, milo's just in it to meme, and jett falling asleep mid session is a massive fucking meme
and he smokes a bowl that's way to heavy for him and he falls asleep
cause even when the story revolves around him, he's not interested
frankly idk what to do about jett
idk it's a pain
yeah
the nor-cal weebs just don't talk
my game had the opposite problem as soon as parsa left
which means that the party doesn't ever shut the fuck up either
he never shuts the fuck up during the game
in that
especially when im not playing
i think the dude has a particular merit to him
i mean also fair
lol
specifically, parsa hates combat
and he likes particular parts of the game a lot more than others
but he's a particularly shitty beast
2-3 times before settling on a character he likes
he will almost always switch like
i think you just have to let him switch
with parsa
but i don't particularly want the dnd to stop, because fuck if my weeks aren't boring as fuck without it.
just say so
if you want to play/take over at any time
again
idk
and then
and them invest them through their characters
im gonna see if i can get them more invested in their characters first
we'll see
not showing up bit is really not pog
yeah the 
parsa didn't need it but he was too in character
cause we really only needed that for milo, and me and jett and miles
great
and shit like that
ooc penalties
if they're just starting out don't include all the uh
and maybe
where you let them know how to play and what to do
make sure to do a session 0 with them
nice
are you planning on running this for your roomates still?
truly is the big cancer
yeah
but im still gonna need to spend some time next week making maps for the desert and stuff
along with almost all the maps from campaign one
amonzako and his statblock are actually in there
cause why not
and then maybe throw a balor at them
cause i don't really give a fuck
to feed their characters whatever they want
im just gonna do my best
yeah
and if they have anything shitty to say
just gonna improvise every session
im literally
here's how im gonna do it
is?
do you want to be a player or nah?
alright
why?
?
fuck her tho.
oh god it's the huntress
or
is it that old fuck?
the full ones?
glad i got my question answered
w/e
true
that motherfucker.
so you're saying i'd be 2 if jett had leveled?
good system
oh i see
oh
already am.
mostly cause there's no fuckin way im boutta roll a new lvl 1 pc when everyone else is level 3
playing it safe is the new motto for this guy.
i wasn't expecting to stray far
big poggers
now i can just say im not there whenever important decisions need to be made and i can let them burn down their town and take no responsibility for the outcome
man im gonna be spending like 90* of my time farming ingredients
alright that was the only question i had.
im a fan
nice
10 damage per round?
so 2 applications and failed saves would be
like
does alchemist's acid stack?
stupid question
hey
i assume my guy doesn’t know shit about ships
albatross 
i think 3 guards
ok
depends on you
maybe
i mean
or more specifically for me?
for the mayor?
can i bring guards?
and
ishi
spirit sage
rolled a d2 for it
it's a tossup between spirit sage and kei shirogane
uh
lemme check the notes again
oh
and by trip do you mean to the avocado grove thing? cause i had assumed none of them
?
but what exactly are you letting us bring
gimme alchemy ingredients
i mean
why am i picking that
huh?
?
im washing my hands of this for the next week
alright, character done
you can't even smite with a bow
why was he not in that meat?
WHAT?
wait he's a fucking paladin?
at least my massive douchenose character had the courtesy to go and get himself offed
but so did i so i can't really talk shit
parsa did make another massive douchenose character.
and he's had the best luck out of all of us
jett's character slaps pretty damn hard
that'll definitely be a 2v2 to see, though
i just want to know where that sunken ship is so i can go diving for Important Guild Paraphernalia 
i pick no sides and will help whoever convinces me
okay.
haha
cause he's a monglet dragon and he wants to fit in
socialites and the like
but as a character he gets really jealous of people who shine when put in the spotlight
he'd eventually become loyal to either ulmo or genichiro
and then that crocodile's death would keep him interested in the rest of the island
and then that crocodile's death would keep him interested in the rest of the island
Learning of said captain's adopted crocodile
He'd just be looking for a lost shipment that one Captain Bronsoir Grut had been carrying. But the captain never arrived and nobody has reported seeing his ship for the past 9 months.
well he wouldn't be related to dundee at all.
he'd be a dundee apologist
cause i hate leaving loose threads
either that or i tie it into dundee's backstory
and deliver like wilting flowers
she'd read hayasaki on a report and think "oh, Rei's house" should do them right
Would a doomer Penny reasonably know that?
hayasaki?
by giving gifts and stealing back lost things
and most things are just excuses to form better relations between penny's house and other noble houses
in recent years the DC thieve's guild has stopped doing really anything important. gambling rings, smuggling for the petty nobles, sham robberies that are more like practice than anything else
Could he have a thieve's guild mission to go and bring a consolation gift or something to Fukui Hayasaki
i was gonna add something
Oh sweet
im just tryna subvert the usual expectations
doesn't fucking leave
neglects all her kids, is a general massive waste of space
could call her a fucking doomer boomer, if you're so inclined
im gonna turn immortalized penny into a really really bored, depressed and drugged out veteran
im gonna turn immortalized penny into a really really bored, depressed and drugged out veteran
who decided on a whim to go and have 20 kids and name them after the people she used to travel with
if you don't have any qualms about it
it's really fucking fun
this is great
ngl im aboutta use my backstory to make fun of everyone's old characters
i spent 1 gold for that
except the censer
for the stuff that didn't have prices like the dragon's blood poison i spent 10 gold
i spent money on all of it
all his equipment can be found on the dnd beyond equipment page
so
alright
xd
tiefling disguise
main guy
js
20 different disguise self tokens
with like
im gonna roll in on this boat
yeah
yeah
and will continue to not say shit
i haven't said shit about it though
nice
everyone's really suspicious of helena
ngl i had hoped you were gonna do that
LUL
LUL
fucker
thanks very much
i'll go ahead and take that -2 honor deficit for snitching
ok
i see
personally i think it helps the group immensely
what do you mean having obscene amounts of money that i hoarde and don't ever share with anyone doesn't help the group?
and once more take advantage of your shadow mechanics to be better than everyone else in just about every way
as the only alchemist my second character will kick ass
it's fine
i think this might be the only time where he plays a decent person
like one after another
jett has a history of playing undependable motherfuckers
and by more i mean much much fucking more
and by probably i mean definitely
listen i probably trust lynelle more than i trust "from slave to master in three easy steps" the character
i mean
i don't think so
also is keeping penny alive REALLY the greater good.
i didn't actually think that lynelle's morals are questionable
house gloom?
lemme go back through the records
i mean 
where else would i go?
are there other ones?
jett's character, nigger black 
what the fuck am i talking about
actually i do
so, no i don't know any powerful evil wizards
that said syvanna also hates me
and maybe syvanna were i to go and dedicate a good portion of my life to helping her attain that lichdom she so desperately wanted
maybe vyrmias could do it with a bit of enticement
aside from that
but i don't trust her to not make copies of my soul
mihara
uhhh
repeat this ad infinitum
essentially, find a decently powerful wizard with questionable morals who wants to live forever with me, then whenever i get old, i cast magic jar on myself and a child that would have been abducted or found worthy of being guild material. put child's soul into a jar, put my soul into the body.
and of course finding someone to cast it for me
it involved the most evil usage of the spell magic jar possible
were you to let us write our own endings
were you to let us write our own endings
i didn't tell you the plan i had
penny 2
penny 2
vyrmias and penny
good idea
oh
just gonna go ahead and ruin milo's whole character
lucia
and
vyrmias
my next character is a green dragonborn decendant of vyrmias
i got it
ok
and im hopefully gonna break that record
currently my fastest int is the end of the first session
i said session 1
and expects session 2
he knows my plans
i made a bet with milo
idk
since i don't know what happened
death/exile
who was the old governor
he's interested in seeking out karmic revenge for the death of his second father figure
in any of that
dundee isn't interested
dude i've literally been telling you for 3 weeks now that my first pc is a murderhobo and im gonna hard int
i'm making an alchemist
when dundee inevitably gets murderfucked to hell for his transgressions
alright
see that sounds dank
ok
i see
cause otherwise i doubt people will use or make them
i think these consumable items oughta be buffed
and a single target 1d10 per round for acid
for alchemists fire
why not an aoe 1d4 per round?
als im saying is
the difference is that it doesn't have the dot effect
 Standard Action. Toss the vial up to 20ft. It shatters and all creatures within 10ft must succeed a DC 12 Dex save or take 1d10 fire damage, halved on success. *Can be made into ammunition

yeah
since it doesn't remain in the area
that's a nerf to alchemist's fire btw
this size is good though
i hate that shit, personally
fine for you
i mean unless you have boomer eyes
it's fine
zooming to 75% is literally the difference between 12 size font and 9 size font
idk
it just takes up the entirety of my screen.
expanding the thing i can see it all
i mean
ok
and you get to feel smarter than them
they'll open it and say "what the fuck" and then you say zoom out 4head
so i don't see the problem
i can just reduce the zoom and have a manageable tab
still
so now it takes up my whole screen
right
i reduced the zoom to about 75% and it was fine
but
i dont know what you even did
no
5/6ths of effect
if i spread the thing across my entire screen
yeah that shit don't fit
k
added rules
jett's monk will likely be team glue, if not him then i have to do it.
but dysfunctional is good
it's gonna be dysfunctional as fuck
great.
with the staff
do an interview section
go a full the office route
there's a way to make that cold open good.
i don't have anything in particular.
and yeah that.
just do whatever you're going to do.
so
i asked parsa about it and it seems he doesn't care about that anymore
anyway
if i bite a dude's leg off he better not say "thank you mr. crocodile"
there better be
the former would be kinda gay
im totally ready for the latter
or fight and die
switch characters?
a truly unbeatable strategy
fucking lmao
and saying "hey we've got a serious population crisis, when are you gonna do something about this"
by eating people
into expanding the town and getting more people
Im gonna pressure this guy
hahah
so he eats farmers
and doesn't know how to deal with complex emotions
now that the old governor is gone he's acting out cause he's sad
and got taken in by the previous governor because he was generally pretty nice
it probably won't be tied to the lore because my whole concept of this character was that he washed up on the shore of this island after a shipwreck
i'll write a backstory eventually
omegafuckinglul
that can sever immortal souls from their host bodies?
mortal blade
is he looking for some sort of
oh
very ironic
fucking incredible memery
honestly
especially when he only ever plays characters that were ripped straight from other games
hell yeah.
and the people journal
yes
lots of drugs
yeah.
if drinking fucking blood is a drug then
because i know what im planning to do to this wonderful list of stuff that you've left in the journal
parsa is preparing you for the worst
it's probably good that you let that happen to you
im already excited.
my expectations are going to be met
this game im going in expecting to eat farmers and get legitimately punished for it. both in the narrative and in the mechanics.
and i expected that nobody else would, so when i got rewarded for that i felt satisfied.
and i made shitloads of stonks because i played the meta game that you had built and nobody else did
and i was okay with that because i got to imagine how it was in my head and that was better
for instance gestalt i expected to spend most of my time and thought building a business that we didn't see in game
me i have expectations based on what im going to do and what i want to do
he wants things to be good and fun and he wants an environment where everyone can get into character and not meme around
the difference is parsa actually wants his expectations met
we just don't say anything
we do
eh
i stopped in you were playing league
you were in call with him for less than an hour
what exactly happened?
nigger
can't VC either
yeah
but enough to not be able to duck game
a little
kinda busy
im not taking nature
do i get free nature proficiency?
ok
he wasn't raised by lizardfolk
as far as i've come up with his backstory so far
my guy aint gonna be much good at anything except killing people
if you put me in charge of this, things will go horribly for everyone involved
im not playing penny
and wildlife
hows about i was the advisor of mechanical engineering
aint hunting
literally waiting for something to put its foot in my mouth so i can eat it
hard disagree
cause they're chad like that
and then they just eat
they hide in the mud and wait for food to come close enough for them to taste it
i mean crocodiles don't hunt
im a gunslinger, not a druid
no
and he walked in and asked for a job like everyone else
his job was to growl at people who had race-related issues until they left.
advisor of racial equality
been on the isles ever since
shipwrecked near hakone
otherwise i can flavor him as a former pirate
unless you wanna make my crocodile the mayor
none
ok
oh
oh we're in hakone?
lets go
cpt proves true once again
well
im good in 5
you said the words
fuck
also im drawing shit rn
im sworn off league
what game?
what the fuck
aight
that shit over
duck game
ok
lmfao
no
yeah
parsa, kevin and his chucklefuck friends
rn
jackbox
im playing
no
at mihara's place
i gave him the frost elemental hearts to do it
yet
he didn't have that
oh no
with his uh
i thought kaede had the gloves
winter gloves?
kaede, uh
idk what else he wanted
i thought jett got the arm?
i mean
yuh
maybe
im makin food rn
ic oof
if it doesn't require a call i can tho
im currently kinda busy
lucia def needs con
fair
what do you mean?
?
this staff and him are gonna have a very tumultuous relationship
and we know how milo be
yeah
maybe this will make milo commit
i mean fuck it
that's huge
idk the fact that lucia gave up all her other shit for this, it should be strong
ic
absolutely not
yeah fuck no
nvm modify memory is a 5th level spell that's gonna be expensive as fuck to cast 20 times
OH
the giants do be dank
we can go wherever
get an eyefull of all the heads im gonna line my gates with once i own this city
yes
that'd be a good point to see the ah, state of the land
js
oh cool
inviting all nobles that want to come free of charge
since im planning on doing a grand reopening of the establishment
there's definitely a session that could be made during this timeline
and level us with that
throw a big monster at the boat at sea
or
just wait like 2 sessions
nah
big pog
with natalie i think i want her there if anything. more friends in high places.
otherwise I can help him get his family out to Nihon, give him a care package or something
im not gonna tell him that im gonna spoil him, but if he decides to come back I probably will
im not gonna tell him that im gonna spoil him, but if he decides to come back I probably will
it's his call
natalie can do what she wants, so long as she remembers she’s always got connections in ol daggercourt. If Silas has people waiting on him in Daggercourt I could get them over to him. Least I can do. But he can’t be a thief with no hands. Just doesn’t work like that.
good for natalie, rough for silas, no hands its up to him if he wants to come home or not
cool
i see
good luck with the rona
and the rest of the guild is promoted and demoted according to their various merits as sovereign citizens of the unsavory sort
everyone in the petty is granted the promotion to operative if they want to take it, otherwise they're blackcaps.
cause she won't change a damn thing
which means she'll be the best at it.
she's the most invested member i know who im also pretty sure doesn't want it.
eh i'd probably have it be gale
very not pog
exactly
so he's out
pretty sure nathaniel hagan aint my friend anymore
i don't trust any of these cunts, especially not chip
fuckin question
good
lul i aint doing that, i'd be managing the guild while they do that
that ARENT mimics
that ARENT mimics
over the course of 5 months, without like compromising the day to day duties of the guild, could i source and capture 20 changelings/people with natural shapeshifting/polymorphing ability?
so one quick question before i decide on anything
ok
kms
sticks and water
nice hints, my guy
One captured thrall babbled on and on about Pure Silver being the key, that lesser metals cannot form the Runes. Strangely, the thrall also mentioned sticks and water?
im retarded
but that doesn't work apparently
i tried removing it from just your journal and clicking show to players
im retarded
i think i fixed it
lemme try and fix that
oof
oh you cant see it?
i thought it was based on the type of dragon you chose
how many elemental affinities did you take?
yeah they’re spells
as of rn theres an npc captaincies and crew but if you tell everyone in the party that you’re the captain now, and they don’t contest you hard enough you’ll be the captain
yeah you're travelling on it
aight
elementals are propelled by rings of fire
standards are propelled by sails and thrusters
standards are propelled by sails and thrusters
do you want a standard airship or an elemental airship?
im gonna do a session 1 tonight
but not at first
the second session
maybe if this thing survives past like
honestly circle probably won't be as useful
that's pretty useful tbh
also
i gotta know what everyone's characters are
artificiers are a big thing there and they’ve got a half decent level of technology 
you don’t need to know much about the setting, but the races are pretty cool
gonna take me like 20 mins
some shit first 
gotta finish
not yet
im cutting a few corners 
intro session should be quick and im using a high level scenario that i’d thought up for my other campaign so
truuuust
no april fools shit, trust
could even start it tonight 
should be like 3-4 sessions max depending on how much you guys fuck around
should be like 3-4 sessions max depending on how much you guys fuck around
very simple
alright im gonna use eberron, you’ll be like level 10, with an airship, kicking ass, taking names, you get tipped off that theres a guy with a huge bounty on him hiding out in the desert so you’re gonna try and capture him
i'll pitch it tomorrow
i got a sick idea
if you want a shortish campaign on wednesdays i can run one.
if you want a shortish campaign on wednesdays i can run one.
3:25 most creative time of the day
i got it
ok
ye
i mean it's missing a few of the op races
pretty sick
except statted out
its literally the entire brandon sanderson cosmere
oh
i didn't get the chance to look at that doc you sent
sure
lmao
in which case i'll fuckin keep pushing for it
unless you want to show off the world you spent time desinging
or we can skip it
basically
whatever i can do to get another guild promotion
i just wanted to make guild connections in kator
basically
that aint bad at all
all that makes it average at 34
i forgot about the cloak
at least not in the chat
nobody responded to it
we can go there after
eh
that aint bad
i mean the sword+sneak attack averages at 22 and caps at 38
need to upgrade that establishment so i can make some more idling money.
xd
only a year
xd
if i don't give that away too yeah.
but
not that 34 is the average
34 damage that isn't resisted for the most part aint that bad
hurray.
fucking
i'll hold off on upgrading the inn and do that then
alright
want this done like just in time for us to arrive
im cheap im not paying more than 2
ok
YIKES
ok
oh
or a d6
a d4 would be better tho
like i'd be happy with +1 cold damage
just enough to get in there
doesn't need to be a lot
cold damage
i'll just contract it out to a spellcaster
shit.
oh right
oh we know hanneman
vyrmias isn't a spellcaster
i mean
contracting
dumbass fire and ice theme with the weapons
go for some
can i get my normal rapier enchanted with the remaining frost elemental hearts?
oh
2 months
we have 3 weeks right?
hmm
so it'll still be resisted
oh
i ask vyrmias
so uh
gotta double check with an angent of hell to be sure that missy pennyworth will work as my true name or if it's some extra bullshit
it can be enchanted later
i just wanted my name forged into it
idk how i'd magificate it
would it not already have the +2 from the steel?
not forging the dam thing
wait the aluminum tools are for masterworking it
no.
also I guess i'm gonna have to drop the mace thing for now. too busy to have to also think about murdering all of house gloom.
see who they know
or better yet i'll just ask the fucking guild.
well is there a smith we know with the tools?
oh
thousand gold tool
fucking
another thousand gold at least?
i assume his tools will cost like
we have bamdul
weapon weight is scaled way down across the board tho
yeah me neither
cool
so 100 platinum should be 2 pounds worth of infernal steel
and dnd coins are supposedly 0.02 pounds
a rapier is 2 pounds
i did the math
aight
also for the summoning, is that platinum worth the weight of the metal or platinum that is the weight of the metal
If I write Yumiko and ask what the fuck happened will she respond?
yikes dog.
uh
alright i got the downtime planned out. Week 1 i want to try conjuring enough infernal steel for a sword, buy bamdul's tools and have him forge it, weeks 2 and 3 im gonna try to bust Mace Meyers out of the Hresvelg house on my lonesome. If that has a serious chance of failure i probably won't though.
xd
ancient greek breath of the wild, sign me the fuck up
but im thinking that when it comes to ancient greek stuff that gods and monsters game is gonna be sick as fuck
origins almost sold me with that ancient egypt shit
that is true
pretty dank
now alexios is ultra chad?
i know that the last time they did the brother/sister pc thing they wacked off the girl the entire game and she was way better
the mcs
right
oh
alexios?
and 4 was just good cause of the guns and gunswords
ngl i did play ac 2 and brotherhood as a fucking psycho with a hammer and had a lot more fun
i don't mind it
so
that part was massively gay
or creedy
it's hilarious that assassins creed is no longer very assassiny
i think
wtf
or just
like cone of arrows?
what?
or like
spins?
like
wait there are aoe abilities?
thats fucked
that said, it's a ubisoft game, ofc it does
i didn't even know it had dlc
ic
the extra shit dlc?
yeah
but the sale is pretty tempting
idk if i'd have bought it full price
pretty good
the most reliable soource of damage
gravity is always
lmao
surprisingly retarded
thats
can they not just swim?
i liked the black flags shit where it just happened for you
the combat makes me unhappy
enjoy ac odessy
well
yeah
i'll ask
huh
ok i'll procure him the tools
hmm
unless i can offer him something else
unfortunately
bamdul is keeping the spear so i've gotta summon some more metal
to forge it right
oh right
could i have them make a gun out of infernal steel?
actually wait
eric how much did you say it would cost to summon the infernal steel for a rapier?
get in here
duck game
ok he's on
yeah
jett's moving his computer
he's not studying he's just taking the test
still retarded
yeah
but
classes don't end i guess
jetts doing a final
sounds like a plan
it's big gay
games don't start
pbe's broken
what game?
nigger.
just made dinner gotta clean my pans n shit
gimme a sec
ok
and i get the feeling that if there is one in kator, it'd be in avaris
so we'd need to find a different circle first
oh
we know the teleportation sigil for daggercourt, right?
oh wait
i see
thanks for the lore
cool
in those days it's either that or shove a coat hanger in there to get rid of the ugly fucker 
i mean fuck, i don't blame him
left town as soon as he found out he got someone pregnant
yeah def
feels single mom, man.
lmao
yeah cause she gave her memories of her dad to the dragon
trying to con the group into doing things for me again
xd
maybe that's how i'd present it.
any leads on metallics we have are worth chasing
this here might be it.
ah shit now that i think about it lautrec needs a metallic rune for his sword, huh.
and that means you'd know what it is
you can't use your rune unless you unlock it
no that's not the case
oh right i forget that he was a dumbass commoner
maybe keep a watch to see if they find glorfindel
idk
i can only assume that this means mace meyers wasn't very honest with his old gang
considering i don't know the doctor
Not that they were going to
She'd tell them not to tell anyone about it for now.
she'd probably just keep it a secret
*now
can't do nothing about it right no
thats a fucking yikes.
oh
when she takes an original what happens to our boy moonsliver?
oh moonsliver isn't even an original hexblade?
yeah free.
oh
the most any other family has is 2 right?
4 in one family, yeah
yeah true
oh
run up to their house, kill the heads collect the swords.
we're working with an assassin so we just gotta go with what she knows best
and then fuck up those other houses
so we gotta sail to the lesser islands
that makes sense
alright
oberlyn but no biggie
unless it's supposed to be me
fucking forgot who lady ordelia is
i also
also
ok
Nathaniel has a nephew in hakone?
better than being surprised
if they're not gonna die then yeah
oh
idk id have them play it safe since i cant help them
thats not good news
alright
and to see what nathaniel wants to do with this hakone princess thottie
to see if the petty found out anything more about mace myers
over the course of the ride could i have written to nathaniel and the petty?
gotta do what we gotta do
still
yikers.
oh
also nathaniel's loan is paid off.
that may be a thing of the past?
oh wait so the thing about him getting old and potentially supplanted
k
oh fuck me i didn't even think about that.
all according to plan
get nathaniel set up as guildmaster and take over daggercourt.
then i can set up a lil guild branch in hakone to start some paralegal trade
esp if she's just gonna give us the dagger afterward
honestly i'd rather everyone come around
w/e
but that's fine
rune memory with all the other nobles
i liked the idea of having to hide them and play like
yeah it kinda blows
ok
i won't even mention it to them
well then i wont rally the people into killing her
yeah it's not multiattack
oh nvm
attack action
a haste action is an extra multiattack for him
by carving out his minor and replacing it with this one
actually lautrec would probably benefit the most
and kaede doesn't want one
well bamdul def wants one
oh i thought it was 1 major 2 minor
but i have room for one more
ik
like i want those runes real bad
we literally just want to murder for her runes
you designed a character that 
that
so you realize
k
lmao
sounds good.
then lynelle and the paladin?
i get the feeling milo will stick to her like glue
it depends on the girl
pretty clear
I like having combat fall apart at the first hint of crowd control
but i don’t care about what makes us better
i think the one thing this party doesn’t need is more damage
hmm
i’d market penny, but a walking caricature of a dirty jew is not great. Lucia has more moral relativism than Penny does, Kaede’s half rarted and Bamdul doesn’t even wear shoes.
no
edgy teenager with an anime sword
no
cause you know we don’t have anyone else that can fulfill that role
could become our brand image
i think we could probably market the paladin
she doesn’t seem profitable
but like
see the more you say about the hakone lady the more i think we’d be good friends
Kill her and mount her horns on my ship, I mean our ship
Oh, gay
the hakone noble probably got some connections to that nation’s seedy underbelly
yeah seems like all penny’s type
maga
we gotta make arentius great again
also with arentians because
lynelle is a hard maybe apparently nobody but kaede likes her, I’d be down to clown with hakone dignitaries 
fuck it sure
uhh
im not at my place
? kinda i'm nearly done.
cause i do cause that'd be funny.
i'll just play the game like i want the doppleganger to win
fair
so i guess i just wont calculate health
cause of the healing passive
but if a fight breaks out my rune will give it away
i think i could do a very convincing job of both
are we dealing with a fucking doppleganger?
yes
uh
then i shoot myself in the head
one game
i’ll play
k
yeah not scuffed
cause if they did i don't know them and i think it's not scuffed
or did they have other names
and renekton?
nasus
azir
as in
uhhh
doesn’t make for good scenes though
downhill arrows are op
yeah def
raining arrows are slow because they’re being fired upward
well not rly
well
true
yeah
raining arrows is way overdone
at least i think
its a more dramatic encounter to try and storm a hill while being pelted by a firing squad with nothing but a sword and a shield
more fun
yeah
i can attack twice with a d8 bow or i can bust out the boomstick and go buck fucking wild
its flavoring
the point isn’t dps
d10s add up
a gunslinger isn’t right without a jam on a nat 1
i honestly like it
the one matt mercer used?
or just short stories 
are the stories connected by an overarching narrative?
also wtf
cool
idk what that is
no
second route ties to your lore better
idk up to you
thatd be cool
but loading property means that it can only be fired once per turn
i figure ammo and black powder is expensive, too
i mean worth though
i see
the gat is mostly for the surprise attack
hard range nerf?
sweet
im gonna spend my money, only question is how much are you gonna charge me to use the tailor for 3 classy as fuck dresses, and one suit that looks something like this
alright
ye
thats fine
for the sneak attack
cause my 3d6 becomes 6d6
its way more dps for me
but im rogue i need crits
it is
400g tier 1 600g tier 2
im reading it
so that's 1k in materials, right?
i'd rather just tier 2 it anyway
ok
what about masterworking a rapier?
arright
aw fuck our box friend is a demon too
k
how much would one of those cost me?
actually a rapier made of infernal steel is way better
how much would you charge me for a +1 rapier
alright i've been going over it
yea
im currently out drinkin
no league
im an hour late anyway
oh
i can't
lmao
but like i don't think he wants to come back anyway
up to him
idk
can make a killing off of kidnapping if we need to
the potential it has for keeping hostages alone is huge
basically
yep
and the mirror is kinda perfect for that
and im currently in more of a basebuilding mindset, than i am a dps mindset
cause i liked it more
it's not all bad
we can loan him the pen sword or something
esp since he afk'd
jett's got dog dps
yeah nah he's fucked
AH
or something
we're supposed to teleport into the middle of their town in order to flex on them
jett has rage too
actually the teleporting thing is supposed to be a power play in the psychological warfare game
oh
so we've gotta cover his dumb ass
but im pretty sure jett's tryna fight
me neither
and i was chill with it
but everyone jumped on it
which is kinda retarded
but i think milo's thought process was he wanted to surprise attack it
that does make sense
yeah
idk
he paces slow as hell
and we've been through like 5 major events
we've only leveled up to four
well a month after it
which started like a few weeks after dark empire
i know in kevin's thing
but idk you could ease into it
i don't think they'd mind
you can make the events longer
sounds good
lmao
who has no idea why he's not in celestia and is instead on our plane
ok yeah that'll blow some minds if we walk into a random butt ass naked aasimar on our way out of jett's village
star things falling out of the portal?
were those those uh
right
oh those were aasimar?
what a pain in the ass
and i forgot the beanstalk is still fuckin there
i did notice that he's still alive apparently
yep
or have velain traveling with us
but that won't work till we get to daggercourt
you could give milo leads through the church
i mean
as i've been doing so far
i mean i just gather your leads and present them to the group
maybe
the bonuses will probably convince them
yeah probably
esp when milo doesn't bring his retainer with us
but it's difficult
i wanna try to get the rest of them in on this stronghold shit
well cool
rumors and stuff come by default, but like specific things i gotta pay for
but yeah
so as a level 1 establishment i can only pay 100 for a +1 but it goes up with level
AH
that's what the book says apparently
and intel gathering checks or whatever
its payment to gain bonuses to spying checks
oh
but that costs like 400-600 gold
or spread information
it gets rumors and can gather information as a stronghold action
yeah
what do you think would happen as punishment?
alright if i decided to fake my identity and name my house House Moash
ok great
i love it
that's fuckin hilarious
i added a section to the treasury handout too
currently all the calculations are sitting in my character sheet
yep
whatever we earn from morozov hasn't happened yet
i don't want to account for money that isn't in currently under my purview yet
and 25 gp left for me.
150 for sabah
actually that doesn't round out very well
business is brutal
and leaving me dead broke
that leaves me with a grand total of 175 that's all going to dear sweet Sabah 
fucking aces
so that's 500 down the drain
of the 775 i paid 200 to chip, probably along with another 300 to the petty over the course of 3 months
and not going back
but thats a decision i didn't actually make so it'd be enacted going forward
they'd probably enjoy that more
which means i've blown 2225 of that 3 k and have 775 left
for a total of 775 a month
dry
I'll be giving nathaniel like 100gp every month to pay off that and then another 375 in taxes for the place and then 300 to the guild cause they're squeezing me
to a fuckton of different people
that would mean the establishment has raised 3k and I owe a fuckton of money
a total of 3.5 months since we left daggercourt
so the timing would be like
alright
or find a reason to do it myself
and then i've gotta go sent someone to pay his bail
im gonna get back to town with a bunch of hangry ass thieves yelling at me that their dumbass boss got caught again.
x d
oof
and nobody cared
reminds me of the great days of old where explorers could run around and just take shit and say they own it
yeah ofc
so long as its not proven stolen
so i can steal legally
hell yeah
but this means i can cut out the middleman and sell directly to collectors?
i mean i normally sell my shit to the guild
i shed gold like a fucking waterfall these days
sounds good
pays out in the long game
eh i'll pay the full tax
oh hahaha
cancer
375 in tax per month
so 250+125
alright
with the addition of an establishment
cause that has gone up
the tax segment on the keep level is a tax that the keep is paying?
just to be sure
fair
oh
don't remember the gold generation off the top of my head
for the establishments
the strongholds and followers info
fuck i've gotta go find all the info
i'll do that then
cool
OK
yeah thats a fuckin lot
im gonna update the table then
Oh
btw how many monts has it been since the last update?
but we cant actually HOLD the gold we have unless we go there and grab it
yeah
cash in on the various business ventures we've been partaking in, and then set up this mirror in my bar to imprison my rivals.
i just wanna get back to daggercourt and check up on our assets
and not worthwhile
is kinda retarded
which
milo said he wanted to kill joseph riegan
actually
i don't think they know what they want
i have no clue
fair
yeah def
ah
right that works too
oh
so you can always hook them back in through her
but lynelle is connected to them
probably
that doesn't make much sense
nah i doubt she'd kill him
show him the errors in his gay build or smth
my sneak is 3d6
its only 1d6 cause he's a level 2 rogue
his sneak attack is not 3d6
lul
but zealot just does that without that
the roguebarian is only good cause of reckless attack
oh he's gonna get kinda fucked
you gonna let him kill her?
arright
i don't think he cares about the story in general enough to really care.
jett
but i can see everyone else ready now
i have been for a bit
ye
but yea that'd be cool
milo prob wont
the fuck
what
xargrul is a chick?
the demon
OH
stat jett's sister?
yeah that could work
oh
idk
but you could def have people in this village that know about it or smth
i don't think collin's gonna open it until he needs to
but im just gonna do it a little less angrily maybe
i mean im still gonna try to stick a knife in her throat
alright
def need to do followup research though, to prove that she isn't bullshitting
grey villains are cool
i like it
im surprised you didn't make us fight syvanna last session
he pays attention but he's got a good amount of big fuckin retard in him too so milo's dumb shit doesn't just fall flat
collin is good
yeah
alright
working on dnd shit rn
i can
you mean talk dnd shit
but that's always been the case
i do feel you there
oof
maybe
eh?
no
yep that's me
nothing
play
i
or at least not later than however late i've already said i'd be
ofc im gonna not be late
like midnight
im gonna be so got damn late
you can bet your ass on that
oh im gonna be fuckin late
i can probably make it by then
well i guess it is my bean
fuckkkkkkkk
you actually need me in the beanstalk?
9:30
ok
sure
hate league
i
im cool with that
frankly, im totally okay with always having the most on hand damage available at any given time
well honestly that's fair
i see
milo would literally die
7 is a long time
i think 5 days is pretty good
fair
yes
already voted
but if we're travelling fast it wouldn't count as a long rest.
the travelling is very easy
cause, esp considering we tend to travel in a cart for the most part
i like first
cause of how we do time in general
sounds fair
gimme a sec to read it
not sure
that's p good
k
do that thats fucking hilarious 
whaat
aight 
seeing lord riegan shit himself in public would be cathartic in its own right
but now i gotta plant the other one in the greenhouse
i was gonna try to force feed it to joe riegan at some point
i knew it was a shitty idea
let milo retard talk me into feeding the bean to the dude in the first place
feels shitty man
yeah
tbh im still pretty iffy about wasting that time
i guess we climb really fast?
and if jett now radiates fastness or something
i know i climb fast
well we uh
right.
oh?
so we can liquidate our assets.
use planear hopping to get back to daggercourt xd
if anything that's our quickest way home
cause that's a load of horsefuckery that would take way too long to deal with
and then climb straight back down
well i mean we'd climb up
cause we have bigger shit that needs dealing with rn
also i would have just turned around at that
that sounds like a pain in the ass
don't do that
uh
but i suppose it's either that or i take a level in fighter and get a bunch of other shit instead
it's not huge at lvl 17 but rogues have a lotta bullshit already, so adding that in just makes it stupid
i now just pump out 6 more damage per turn that will scale up to 12 later
but rapier and dagger
or dagger and crossbow or smth
lets say i choose two weapons, rapier and dagger
well
wheras just the fighting style is +5 no scaling
but that would scale up to +6 later
technically if i were to use this to nominate my dagger or smth i'd just get to add+3 to my damage on all offhand attacks
*damage mod
which is op
it was proficiency mod rather than attack mod
i was gonna link something but it was kinda broken
nvm
or maybe just this.
which feels fkn bad but w/e
it means i lose out on a +1 to my strength.
so can i use this feat to just get the dual wielding fighting style?
apparently the site i saw that i could get two weapon fighting as a feat from weapon master was fake
oi
ok
*the petty is mollified with the 200g buy in they should go for it.
and if they
no archbishop to immediately shut that shit down
pretty decent
that's
He can collect 200 from the lovely miss Sabah, and hit the church. But only if he’s got a clean plan that the petty’s all on board with.
In character, Penny is certainly a gambler.
Hmm
he doesn’t need to know that though
i mean if he sells it to me im just gonna sell it for even more to morozov
well
fair
he needs 200 g up front to pull the heist
i see
chip will sell it?
if i can negotiate a price for it it may be worth doing.
oh the crest stone right
or information?
or a tool?
is it a weapon?
something morozov would like? is that as much detail as he got?
and if he has leads i would always like to hear them
i applaud his massive balls
no robbing the church is stupid as fuck
missed the subtext there
OH
oh
and i guess yeah, when we get back we can go rob someone.
nobody agrees that they haven't hit anything? or agrees that he's not a bitch?
lemme type this up into a comprehensive, yet still entirely unhelpful format for everyone else.
cool
but yeah we do know how to find him
xd
tim’s an asshole
we just met a fuckin wizard
wait
seems like its time for the boys to get to work
so the price of magic items has skyrocketed, eh?
HMM
if we return to the city, we’re all gonna get drafted because some asshole drone striked a foreign dignitariy?
sooo what you’re saying is
fuck
oh
I’ll compile this info and deliver it to everyone else in Penny’s signature shitty manner, as usual.
yikers
so fair i guess 
anything about it
He’s a dragon, he literally has never needed to learn magic
Fuckin sweet
Sweet
Gross
I see.
alone?
oh cool
is fuckin hilarious
this shit
aight
i suppose
i care greatly about what random motherfuckers with dog tier jobs think of me
im not gonna say shit
hell no
and join on phone
i can also just call
late
hm prob 15-20 mins
oh
but was 29
its not 50
friday night
downtown
so i’ll take train half way then uber the rest
but its 50 bucks from here
i will
says
im trying to get home faster
no
alright
even more reason to go big game hunting
that means if we do it they'll be impressed
idk goliaths are afraid to hunt them
well
i don't fucks with fire
wtf
i didn't
and have predator heat vision?
the dinosaurs breathe fire?
ez glap
dinosaur leathers and dinosaur ivory
it wouldn't even be difficult
we could make a killing off of dinosaur leathers in the southlands
that said
and also not lazy
just not stupid
i wouldn't say smart
so im gonna be poor as piss for a while
but THAT goes straight to the debt for the building
if jetts deal is carrying through i'd walk away with 133 gp for my troubles
gotta spend money to make money
when i get back i owe 600 gp btw lmao
and it was all going to the guild dues p much
*least
that was what jett told me at leasat
i get half the income from the shop i brought in
if im still getting the same deal from morozov that makes 733 a month
yah
at level 1
book says 1k per season
the name
well
added it
i think i forgot to
daily
to bathe in
to fill with gold coins
my end goal is to commission a solid gold bathtub
im literally playing goldsink: the character 
like
gold sinks are good when we have gold
well
im down
LOL
like brutal items
rn the runes have made us very strong
mundane items that are a little better
but you can always hit us with like
there should be more, tbh
yeah
the video?
here maybe you'll think this is interesting
you like frozen
oh
dw im meming
tabaxi
oh.... noo....
oh
im just saying i'll only know it's her if you explicitly tell us its her and sometimes shit happenes
*don't intend to fight her tbh
i don
i doubt we will
luckily you can't counterspell a crossbow bolt to the face
i don't know if her cleric style even has that spell
i forget that lucia isn't the same cleric as gemi
wait did she?
lucia did
well
:/
and my crossbow?
is she powerful enough to escape me and my big goliath friend?
you know, "weebs to the pyre" and all.
no guarentees that we won't kill on sight
but gonna have to see her first
i think we'll try
she's a mage?
and then see if we can extort these goliaths for everything they own
im here to kill the fucking guy i didn't make
he wants the golden robes
it's a double staff axe
fuck.
is that a thing we're cool with?
can i unagree to it?
fuck me what did i agree to.
you mean there's gonna be a two step process to our money making up here?
christ
do goliaths even use gold?
rly?
i was enjoying making titloads of dosh by wrecking the economy
this shit's turning out to not be very lucrative
i don't think so
did we make any money off of that last village?
btw
momentarily forgot
cool
nvm i know what you're talking about
OH
oh ok
i'll read it
i haven't checked em in a minute
they're in the tabs?
ok
mask avatars?
hol up
uh
they're straight as fuck
and lesbians aren't gay
but it'll probably just be ana/elsa porn
with jojo
she already does
i mean
yep
lmao
and she wore less for longer
way less
i thought elsa was way less thicc in this movie
l m a o
but i know the feel
i've been desensitized to it
lmao
nice
how was it getting past that tidal wave of fucking people?
ye
so i guess you’re good to just get on
im 2 mins away
sweet
cool
i’ve gotta be sure cause last time i tried this was with jonah and he can be pretty retarded
first as in the one in front, right?
i’ll fucking be there at 12
the bus bitch looked me in the eye and drove right past me, the absolute fuckin bitch whore
never mind
cause you get on at the sci center one, right?
just message me when you get on/which part
maybe 11:47 if all the stoplights decide to be particular pieces of shit
should be there at 11:46 or so
not too long
yup
meming
he did like a year ago just fuckin 
ur good
not as whipped as uti then
aight fair
WHIPPED AS FUCK
WHIPPED
...
ahh
w/e sounds good
drop off a coffee?
edge of the sci center 
actually next one after
yep
vermont/expo
ye
k
i don't
game?
except we're all gonna call him a nigga
i'm gonna put him in a similar echo chamber
same
yes. hard agree.
which
and he said "i'm black so no. i'm allowed to say gamer words."
i asked him if he's ever had a real gamer moment
that's just how that shit work
he's black
cause
so like what the fuck
and j's name is actually mike
so i got contacted by j
same
nah he's a full force goon
i'd rather deal with 3 than 5 anyway
well that's fine then
idk if you got any more messages
one more that actually messaged me on reddit
the level of engagement in this trial conversation was like 7-8 on my end and a 5-6 on his
wow
*got
had to find it and god distracted
jordan
i think
im not the biggest fan of brandon sanderson guy
personally
he's aight
ok
here
no
yeah
*details
you’re gonna get hoards of notifications asking for campaign detail 
found it
and i only post random bullshit
you already know mine
cool
oh
what post?
hell yeah
yes
this is industry experience that i can use in other places
but the thing is i don't want to work in food service for the rest of my life or anything
thats fuckin ridiculous
which will be cheaper
by telling the bitch im out and cleaning it up nice and proper
yeah
i just got it how i wanted it
the only thing im really upset about is my fuckin house
there are things you pass up and things you don't pass up
if im getting the opportunity im out
nah fuck that
and then i can move back to LA in a year and do other shit
at least with this i can hate people and make money
barbacking sucks cause you don't make enough money
bar tending sucks cause i hate people
but that shit gay
i could do that
man idk i feuckin hate tv tho
i can easily go till 5
on a good day
and i don't sleep till 3
esp since your 9 would be my 11
i can keep friday free
xddd
but LA sucks
well cali doesn't suck
cali sucks
very old
an old friend of my dads
if it's decent money im just gonna do it
i'd need to see the money
im not sure
ass georgia
s l a v e
yeah
im prob just gonna get shot
yuh
yuh
not yet
you wanna join still or nah?
is telling us a loooot of what we know
he wants us to roleplay
not bad
same
but w/e
cause school schedules and shit
prob will only be like a few weeks long
k
im thinking i may also run a thing during winter break
when this doesn't pan out
oh
sucks
yea same tbh
it was published by one of the players who’s part of the acq inc podcast thing
but i’ve seen the module and the map for it online
he made the guide character 
he didnt
but i can't really hold it against him cause the acq inc thing is a module that he didn't make
his illusion dungeon was better
but he's had better
i thought it was okay
3 of his things
i've run through i think
yes
i doubt this'll be very different
but you have already had a taste of how he runs things
it was a oneshot module
did you take part in the acq inc one?
actually
if jett and i are drawing aggro it shouldnt be too bad
party is pretty strong
plus milo shreds through them like cheese to a grater
i liked all the villagers being dead
no
ok
right
don’t change your names
don’t change your names
w/e
dudes gotta pick his battles
my name is fucking Ram
jetts name is Lance Longspear
cause that sounds like an “because i said so” sorta deal which is bullshit
did milo ask that?
why?
i mean
parsa’s trying to veto it?
he can’t choose that name?
last session was sick
no gestalt was good
i haven’t talked to milo
jett’s already not feeling it
it’s not gonna pam out
that sorta shit
prove he was right
though
he wants to use this to vindicate his bitching in your campaign 
idk
but hes only planned one session 
it’s designed to keep going
yes but that was a oneshot
and dip
just say “wo too much”
you can still back out
idk bout nikliq
agile monkey works
you know what he wants to use this for, right?
why?
oh no
hey
sounds cool
way too cool to be forced to pass up
definitely 
could not have done that with jett playing him tho
makes the visions and morozov’s actual actions more impactful 
it limits it in an interesting way
is cool
the fact that he can only see visions of things that he’ll see with his eyes in the future 
no i like that
like that
yeah
the visions are cool as a plot device for gathering info
feel
shit
lol
Oh
or you can use her for what she really is and use her as bait for anything you want to force me to do.
alright done, you can read it to vet it or not and if you think you'd rather me not have my second pc sitting in campaign then i can toss it. 
tavern
i'll be giving most of it to the party and the petty anyway
but not all the money
sure
i'll put money into the vault
for that same reason im not gonna put the establishment's income on the ledger.
not on the ledger
im jotting it down into my character sheet
i do.
yes thieve's cant family
not sure if you saw earlier but until penny dies, she's owner/manager of the establishment while penny's out of town. the petty is to treat her like family
im gonna go ahead and finish the second character sheet with a background and shit
i guess
real boomer shit
its a display item
im not even gonna read it, just put it in my bookcase
its hardcover and goddam gorgeous 
just bought another copy of dune instead
i feel like an ultra boomer
k
we’re keeping everything as is?
yes that’s what i ask every week
hahaha
i don’t ask for directions 
no im a man
they opened up a new one on ventura blvd so i figure they’re doing well
so not surprised 
santa monica is zoomer central though
oh right
actually 
most of them
grove
guess i deserve that one
hate reading digital
i think it’s sold out
barnes and fucking noble
dammit they don’t have blood song
k
which is not how that happened
parsa told me he messaged you, said he was dropping cause he wasn’t having fun, then you offered to change things to keep him on
i didn’t know there was a call before the one where jett called the group
like
looking for it rn
blood song right
blood something 
whats that book called?
OH
parsa did not tell me the whole story
i wasn’t there for that but if he’s right that’s fuckin toxic
setting all this off
milo said he basically guilt tripped you into changing the game for him
this was a lot of bullshit to get to the answer that needed to happen
so i guess we found an answer?
we'll get there
yeah
like fucking not being complete fuckwads?
what do you mean changing?
yea
have to go dungeoneering to find source of issue
now we're stuck with angry elves
crops failing
weather starts going abnormal
mentors send us out on a mission to see what the fuck happened with glorfindel
that'd be pretty funny
with a character here
but don't have any ideas for what i'd do or want to do
personally think it's pretty cool
i
id be down
if you think running it will be fun for you
with that
idk what you can rly do
i know
he wanted to go into dungeons and find magic items i guess
but we were working on that
so i guess he had issues with how strong the archbishop was
he essentially wants to get stronger relative to the things we're facing
and it was so hard to get him to say them
he said 3 sentences
and im pretty sure miles too
boxes that at least parsa wants checked
it would definitely hit the uh
sounds good
yeah
in that i'd be trying to get home
but i think i could make it work
so i was planning on playing someone from daggercourt
hmm
nice
ez fucking pz
yeah
and the early levels is us travelling there
it could be we're headed to daggercourt
that's kinda sick
oh
and long
league universe is huge
but kinda depends on where and when
could be cool
a campaign set in league universe?
so just the first book is all you need?
rly
you were fuckin right about the stormlight series so i trust your judgement
i'll read it at some point
sounds pretty dope
remove all the magic classes?
which was both a great idea and the worst idea
i got into dune instead
but never read it
i've actually seen and held the physical book
blood song
yeah i feel you
agreed
it’s gonna be a hot minute
so
they’re hand made and they’ve got 17 thousand backers
they’re actually ridiculously good looking
cant decide between a purple or the pearlish one for the second color
got 2 sets
btw
oh i did the dice kickstarter
oh i did the dice kickstarter
peace
aight
shit
yeah
and i doubt i can make miles invested
i doubt parsa will change 
hopefully at least milo will come out more assertive 
idk take that as you will
so
yelling at them over this week
im gonna spend a lot of time
yeah
lol
parasite makes addams family look like dog shit on a brown wall
its very good
well you watch it
fuck
you’ll love it and hate it
watch that
Parasite 
duude
nothing gets me more creative than that
i think you should spend some time finding creative ways to stick your dick in your girlfriend 
is all
and im not even making it
i think this shits incredibly stressful 
then do that
Ok if you want to think about it
i knoe
take a week break at least before you do
that’s making me into a doomer
christ
i think
but thats not a pc
he was a good npc
i think 
the noxalas thing
yeah i told him it was retarded before the campaign even started
this time its on us to fix that
not last time
that would fix his issues
i think if you took a gamble and put parsa’s storyline in the spotlight first
well we can change the fixation on the characters around
but i don’t think he’s been told to stop doing that 
he knows and he does it willingly
true
i mean when we on them hearing it already 
lmao
k
when?
you’re right about all this shit btw
im tilted as fuck
gdi
another reason im about to rip into him
parsa does
it would have been hilarious 
and the dragon scouts and we try and disguise the giants as hills
i left our plan vague for a fucking reason
i know you had plans
then we talk it out
i feel you on that
nobody has to prep sessions but you
majority rules is retarded in this case
and im just gonna say that if they don’t want to play your campaign then they either need to fuck off or make their own
i feel like im the only one that wants to interract with the old one
oh smart
but shut the fuck up
and i gotta do it too
yes
and when he proposes an idea he doesn’t give a reason
to me parsa is the first target specifically because he spends 80 percent of his time on campaign chat shooting other people down
other people don’t engage enough 
i talk too much shit
i know
well im thoroughly pissed and im moments away from chewing this nigga out
ok
ok
and that was today?
he didn’t mention that 
wtf was that about parsa’s flaming?
a 6 hour call with milo
i fucking go out and look for hooks
ok i’m actually so pissed at psrsa did he complain to you about campaign shit in pms?
the problem here is entirely the players
we were members of an army with higher-ups that consistently sent us on missions
the difference is that black empire was railroady
the problem is the players
js
which it wasn’t 
that would have been so sick
and nobody disagreed
just because he said ok i’ll do it
jett was playing this character 
here’s the problem 
were you going to use the climax of this story to kill jetts character?
it’s literally got so much room for conflict 
i was fucking loving it
im not gonna lie
it really is
idk he was in the game for 1 session
what can i say
who was clearly his bbeg
he refused to even consider meeting the archbishop 
well
or fucking not responding 
or talking to low level grunts
or praying to fina in seclusion 
what the FUCK do you mean “I spend my week building a grove”
completely ignored
ye
i would think we’d have moved onto house gloom after riegan
so
but i really just wanted to see parsa’s character die
i complained about that too
and i am pissed
i’d be pissef
yeah
that was everyone for no reason
only parsa complains about that
fuck phone keypad
*work
i have an idea that won’t worj
unless the characters work together 
they literally did
take your time, if they’re gonna bitch this much they don’t deserve campaign 
hey, sorry we’re a bunch of retards, me included
cool
i tried to switch pages and hit the wrong button on my phone
yes apologies 
ok now penny wants to run a whorehouse that empowers women or some shit?
ok now penny wants to run a whorehouse that empowers women or some shit?
oof
oh
oh ok
my dad fucked a dragon ez
for me having magic
had a reason planned
i actually 
oh
may as well just kill myself
hilarious 
and as soon as i go magic they go none
ofc when they go magic i go none
im going sorc
Will be ripped from Penny’s backstory, with a couple added details
well i have the character in mind if you want me to run it by you
alright 
is this what you really want to do?
so
thor will find a way
which idk
but that’s of course assuming that we won’t start immediately killing each other once the throne is in our grasp
which means we gotta walk up to nilgeshes fucking shack at the end of the universe and chop his head off with an axe
but once we ascend to dukedom we gotta make sure we aren’t ruling a heaping pile of shit, right?
yeah
i mean right now
yeah
cause they get reborn still
unless you’re like a pitchfork salesman
riots are bad for business
i don’t fault the church for that
cause if the general populous knew that all that awaits them is eternal suffering, they’d go batshit
made to keep people from losing their collective shits
i think that’s a white lie
but i think telling Nathaniel that I set Glorfindel after her is enough to appease him.
i have a way to confirm this
oh
Btw is syvanna gone?
i can only assume that people like Syvanna and the archbishop know this
and thats what we’re stuck in
yikes
ok makes sense
OH
oh
but since you pointed out tbe guy from the future i have no fuckin clue lmao
the past of the 8 losing to nilgesh but then getting twisted to fit the churches false doctrines
i thought it was like
no that shits rarted
you gotta find a way to make that spear scale off of his cha
laugh
watch him fuck up by using cunning action 
keep the rune as is
will definitely make up for jett’s current lack of magic items
yeah it’s a pretty sick rule
cool
ic
they would have to beat his ac +10 in order to hit at all
cause 
and would you rule that ranged attacks track or naw?
so bows and spell attacks?
does that work for all attack rolls?
i didn’t see that
oh
i’d add that
thats kinda sick
save that for when jett rerolls w fighter
that’s pretty sick
also he didn’t build coffeelock
cause with 3 levels in sorc he’s sacrificing his level 9 spell
still, to get maxumum usage of that, he’d need to invest 3 levels into sorc for quicken and twinned spell. so it works
ok
if that’s what you meant, then im sorry that shits rarted
so long as the spell that can be casted as a bonus action isn’t a full action spell
i think it’s fine as is
sooo
yeah but then he chugs 5k gp and we flame him for a week
so the sorcerer multiclass would be neutered anyway
also he’s clearly not going tomelock
i don’t think he’ll multiclass into sorc
the problem is that i don’t know if jett is mechanically savvy enough to really get the most out of it
this rune is sick
but who cares
with other item combos
ofc there are ways to break it
so it’s not broken
also, uncanny dodge is strong, but it’s not evasion 
if he has to change characters at some point i wouldn’t give him this same version of the rune, though 
the 2 spells in one round would be great on anything but a warlock so that evens out too
he still only has 1 action, 1 bonus action, and 1 reaction
also its not like he’s immune to being bursted by a fuckton of ememies 
and the cost is huge
yeah it’s a single round
*oh
toh
thats his fucking RUNE?
*consistently reads them
*that
fr it’s kinda annoying even for me that im the only one thst reads the handouts
ok
because i lean towards the rule of cool in pretty much all situations 
if you want a realistically opinionated pov i’d run it by parsa
but
sure
i won’t use it yet, still gotta talk to nathaniel.
i see
3 rows of 3?
in like a square pattern?
ok
oh tf
i see
*now
if he's over it, then whatever i'll start building businesses right no
i don't plan on leaving miles' quest thing hanging
i thought so
either before we free those prisoners or after
or at least in game
there are conversations that need to be had but i feel like they’d be better done in person
i guess that’d be something for next week
having it not be officially on jett's record means the taxation wouldn't be as high, which is just a win for us
and maybe to sign the deed to that house over to as well
all i want is a name to take a hresvelg loan under
yeah i'd be willing to go through the pains to do all that
i see
ok peace
oh if he can help i’d gladly pay him in the gold standard
yeah, basically
oh, wealth is a problem
what i really need is the finery to look the part.
I can draft up a letter from my house back in olde nordic country Z, and try to trick william grey into signing it
i have three people potentially on my side in the form of current lord morozov, nathaniel hagan, and hopefully syvanna when i “pledge” myself to her righteous cause.
i’d be a foreign noble from whatever country in your world qualifies as the closest to old nordic
seal
once i get myself established as a minor noble, I take out a loan and turn that house into an Establishment.
i could pretty easily take it to the hagans
actually phase one is just getting a fake identity verified by a government official
i had a different plan to spend my off weeks on but I guess that’s on the back burner 
if she is im telling her fucking mom, cause she can’t do that shit alone.
well i’d still need to go and confirm this with the lady herself 
ok
i c
well i cannot make that assumption in character 
everyone who has their rune awoken has these visions?
idk i think the vision could be enough to give me the spark of the idea
aw shit
one, confirm that syvanna plans to fight nilgesh
well i need to do 3 things now
i see.
parsa’s wizard or the cleric?
no wonder she thinks she’s a good guy
oh my god
but it’s wrong
oh my god.
this crazy bitch syvanna thinks she can fight nilgesh with her frankenstein angels???
oh
yeah i figured that
is it the god that’s specifically watching over us?
not lautrec’s
i understood mine
maybe, if it becomes an option i MAY search out a few methods of attaining immortality just to escape that shit
until it becomes important.
honestly as a normal human with no magical talent and no particular faith im just gonna internalize that shit and pretend i never saw it
lol yeah
i just hope they’ll throw a party for me when i get there
but i already know i’m going to hell
well i can hold that on iago’s retard head
gotta think of the wardrobe for when im duchess xd
well i could it’d just be a massive power play
i can’t wear open backed dresses anymore.
fuck man i knew this shit was morally corrupt
yeah i can see people wanting to cut off my ass for this thing
ok
do i only add con to that first death save?
ok
does that death save count as the first one when stacking?
cool
its straight lifesteal?
OH
does that apply after evasion or before?
and 5/6 of all aoe damage?
i take 2/3 damage from all single target damage
so just to be sure on the mechanics of this
i’m actually so impressed at how hard you just memed me
holy fuck thats gold
... did you just tell me that my rune is a trampstamp?
*in
i’ll talk it over with nathaniel next session. he gets the last say im that regard.
if not then all she’s doing is increasing the bandit population. and bandits are good company.
that said, if miles wants to pull another angel out of his ass to smite that bitch.... that’d be nice.
of course it does become a problem when she starts trying to resurrect elderitch horrors and shit but that’s what spies are for.
so if we get her legitimized and we help her with her crazy heists  and let her expand operations as far as she wants (outside city walls) there really shouldn’t be a problem.
fighting the archbishop inside the city is a fuckin mistake
which actually works in her favor
which is fine, as long as it stays outside the city
considering she’s going for fucking words of power she probably wants to fight her mom for it
i know she wants to instill herself as archbishop 
so long as they’re doing all their slaving outside the city it’s actually beneficial to us.
specifically by simply legitimizing her group
i will turn her into an asset in nathaniel’s regime
alright this is something that can be solved with diplomacy 
yikes
or specifically low level thugs that didn’t even get picked for that
you know, as part of the initiation process?
also aren’t all the guild rejects already dead?
this is not okay
as for what she’s after, i’m going to pull my lawful evil card and take a hard pass on dealing with any of that shit. not my pay grade 
i’ll tell them to be careful and be polite.
they’ll be at it again this week
xd im just berating them
i mean i just wanna ask her a goddam question is it really that hard to stalk someone in a friendly manner?
cause im gonna keep them on that if not.
did the petty manage to track down syvanna yet?
goddam
52
ok
feels scrub man
lemme roll it
i was thinking of my hp from a different game
oh nvm
yes
cause that will outright kill me
or just right now
if i fail?
but i’ll do it
gale ordella and vorok from the petty with me to staunch the bleeding and grab nathaniel if i suddenly drop dead during the process
i’ll have uhh
i trust my con
fk it
i mean is it a wis roll or an int roll to remember?
oh
i don’t know anyone who can use it
which is getting written down in the personal ledger btw
i spent it on parsa and milo
i literally don’t have the money
so i’ll wait till the rent comes in.
i have a rune but i already spent my money on helping lucia get hers
that pretty much applies to everything
the more relaxed you are the better you’ll do in the interview 
and idk, stop pressuring yourself 
just do well
fuck campaign 
well
idk if he wants to attone he’s gotta actually put some effort into it in game. i wouldn’t make that something he can do in an off week or something 
well he is a real cleric i just think that making up half of a deity and saying “deal with this” isn’t a valid way to make a character
well he is a real cleric i just think that making up half of a deity and saying “deal with this” isn’t a valid way to make a character
actual clerics and paladins deal with much harsher fallouts for disobeying their gods.
oh well remove some of his spell slots until he helps people for real
wait so it’s not an evil god?
for the better?
it doesn’t make sense that it’d care about the murders if it gets stronger from them
what does it like, what does it dislike
but that didn’t happen. Honestly what i’d do is take complete control of this made up god of his and assign some actual fucking rules to it
at most, that guard would’ve have to sign a form that he killed this criminal in self defense 
the broken cell and the scar is already more than enough evidence 
lop his head off and feed his body to the pigs
he also attacked a member of the guard with magic and intent to kill.
not only did the prisoner break out of his cell
a killing without a cause
right, but that isn’t like
i would have killed him there
and then when he walked out of his cage
after the fight in the cell
i didn’t mean the fight on the streets btw
yeah he was fucked
play stupid games, win stupid prizes
i would have. Parsa played that like a retard.
should have killed him last session 
to you
and imma ride one of these here birds
ok you fuckin wait there
ahh fk
but i just crossed cause there weren’t any crosswalks
on it
yea fk
im at the first one.
?
possibly 
fuck
the one by vermont
im closer to the second one
first station?
i can cross
sounds good
i am across the street from it, actually 
im like halfway down exposition blvd to your place
lemme bust out the map
uhhhh
...
omw
k
just cause i wanna ride the expo in my costume 
i’ll probably go to milo’s anyway 
yes plz
easier on me and we get to hang later
idk
im coming with milo to your place
yeah
thats a keeper
loaded dice?
sick
and now its time to put my unreliability to use and only tell the rest of the squad my own heavily opinionated version of this information 
yep
nah. despite all those great reasons to not make this crackpot assumption, I think those rank shits would totally purposefully burn houses in order to buy them up
those rank shits would purposefully burn houses in order to buy them up
thats also a reasonable conclusion to come to
thats too much effort for too little gain
ehhhh
oh wait it’s a messenger bag i’d have to cut it off
but id still take the bag cause fuck him and his house
that’s kind of shit
so it’s definitely people who already have some sort of involvement with the hresvelgs
i see
like is he looking at houses and deeming them irreparable 
is there a pattern to the skipping or is it seemingly random?
i don’t care as much about the value as i do about fucking him over in this specific case
but i can understand if that’s a bit too conspicuous 
hopefully i stole his gift pouch to put a stop to that bullshit
fuck the hresvelgs im gonna ice that guy
OH the guy i stole from is doing it
ok
are the bids anonymous?
cool
so these ruined buildings could be bought up and rebuilt?
oh my
o
o
only needed 55 gp
did penny manage to pay her guild dues over the course of the week?
assuming this job doesn’t flop and we do get the house and i do turn it into a tavern, are you gonna stop me from hiring him to perform in it?
i hear noxalas is being retired?
jett and myself are the only ones that kind of make sense
to be on that list in order to get the info
we just need one of us
i’ll probably wait till session to see how they play out
* work
I have a few ideas that could worj
is very dangerous 
having lautrec put his own ass on the list
i think
alright 
OH
oh
maybe under a fake name
i doubt getting on it suits our purposes
oh i see
i see, does it track unauthorized visitors?
week 1 i didn’t have them doing anything 
btw could they have found where his apartments are in the citadel?
week 2 was them doing reconnaissance on william grey
not if there are alarms blaring
there are ships that dock there, right?
that'll break after we get on the island?
what about have a shoddy one made?
yikes
how much would you say it is to buy a 15+ft boat?
fair enough
but it's probably better off that that doesn't happen
not gonna lie i was definitely excited to see what might happen what kind of fit noxalas would have when he finds out the cart is full of tabaxi slaves
well that's fine, so long as milo isn't on the recovery team
so w/e
we need the cart to carry the cage
or maybe the drugs wore off by now, i don't know
a cage of drugged tabaxi
ok
same
i feel like if we time it right, the guards wouldn't see us climbing down off the bridge, but coming back up the bridge is the problem
yeah
it's not
if not i suppose sailing in is the play
?
has anyone so far invented anything close to a parachute
i see
i thought there was a way down from the silver bridge
im gonna need much more than 50 feet of rope
i see
it is?
i'll hold off
i was gonna make a reference to it but
have you seen the movie?
no
as fast as possible 
kill everything and dip
goon in there looking like cultists
that’s the plan
paint them red cause penny isn’t all that imaginative.
i’ll do that.
don’t want this lady to be stupid and put something identifiable on the masks
actually fuck it i’ll just take blanks
still shit masks?
how much for 30?
painted blanks
probably just painted
i mean simple
if it’s above 20 gold for 5 im taking the blanks
how long/expensive would the commission take?
yeah essentially 
miles and parsa 
I don’t doubt miles can handle that
sure
which means he’ll probably send for them once we break in.
so not guards, but they get together when he needs to go out and handle business 
i see
so, elite strike team. Is that his personal guard?
40 gold, actually 
and i’ll pay them 30 gold for the week
maybe some circus/carnival masks if i can find them
5 big black fuckin cloaks for the party and a few squares of dyed red cloth for me.
that went fine?
so while the petty was doing that i was getting materials for the mission
yeah
do i have to pay them more? or is the week worth of thievery enough to cover that.
cool
feelsbadman
not from what i can tell
im looking
i'd back it for those
i wonder if there are playtest versions
yeh
looks like it could be better than the first book
mhm
not as good as the crit role show though
reached it's goal in 4 hours though pretty good
situation
but maybe for a next run
yeah
the eta is may 2021
can't
my shift starts in 30 mins, unfortunately.
His character, i mean. Milo will most definitely know.
but I do think it would be very interesting if he somehow found out about that
I’m not going to tell milo about the part with the enslaved tabaxi on hard catnip
but i’ll bring it to the group
im just saying what i could do with it
nah it’s your game
or even 2-3 main crew and have the petty help the rest of them with in-city problems
but probably wouldn’t need all of them. So 2 or 3 main crew and the petty
whoever wants to come
uh
i’ll tell the boys to pack their bags
so you’re saying the time limit is right fucking now.
Is there a specific timeline that this assassination needs to happen by?
i’ll take the rune.
i’m still going to play penny as an anti-rune anarchist, but everyone has their small hypocrisies
right
and this also means that this rune was harvested from some poor dead asshole, right?
have you already planned one for each character?
btw everyone is born with an inherent rune right?
fucking shit man
do i know what a lesser rune of the quickblade does?
fair enough
read their stuff
i saw them
oh hell yeah
i honestly expected anyone else
did not expect sylvana folen
Oh fuck.
maybe I’ll gloss over some of the more unappealing details for our two good party members 
sounds like a plan
“at your service” fuck
shit didn’t catch that part
slaver
yeah i did
we’re gonna have to talk to the guy about it
definitely a birthday, though.
so i’m assuming it’s not a party
well i didn’t see party in the letter
hopefully combat hasn’t started 
im on my street 
away
less than 5 mins
but we'll see if i finish up at a reasonable hour
about half my crap over there
i'm gonna be busy moving
that's correct
fuck em
nope
i'm gonna fuckin shout retard shit at the top of my lungs
that'll be great
yeah
yeah, but I won’t be able to get all my stuff there till friday 
yeah
we’re in
Just got the keys to the place
don’t know which one it is
outside 
i just thought it was farther
no
so thats my excuse 
there are like 3 in a 2 mile radius from here
i apparently got directions to the wrong taco bell
much closer than i thought
you’re 
st
st or pl?
ok
shouldn’t be more than 5 bucks anyway 
eh
*it
have its 
the app?
was heading a different direction earlier
im on adams unfortunately 
im gonna look for one of the scooters
but uber gay
i could uber
its a 30 min walk
36th shit
sounds chill
i’ll be there
oh mile away
what are you up to?
i walked
 i wish
so should be good
looks like i charmed the landlady
if not that 20 min walk then a 15 minute drive a little to the north
but i’ll probably be real close to usc
*shit
they gotta do their shir
and its not a big deal regardless 
i didn’t bring it up originally 
ye idek
at least, not unless she has someplace else ready to go
milo just doesn’t want to leave his moms
well yeah i would have moved closer to there
but the thing with milo and the others fell through cause they’re unreliable 
been trying to move since like early august 
and the place is affordable 
cause i don’t want to live at my dads 
yeah pretty sick
across from usc
yeah thats what i was saying
cool
 2924 Van Buren Pl
oct 1st
i may be moving to a place like right across from you
right, just a little ways past the village
ah cool
you’re off of 30th st right?
sure
oh xd
explaining the guild’s inner workings to a wee initiate
sounds good
xd
house gloom strikes me as the type to have a metallic 
the great houses and such
metallic runes are gonna be in like
fair enough 
nice meme
literally anyone but us
hahaha
all of these 8 characters were either massive assholes, complete fuckin idiots, or both
for one
like
that's fucking hilarious
literally
because it's not at all what happened
this is an impressive meme
okay
Gemi the Clever
wait now i gotta read it
fuck
oh really?
why
it's so fucking long dude
i haven't finished
is fuckin long tho
one
that church of seiros
read nearly all the lore
thats always fun
i especially like jett getting shit on by rival nobles
well it’s solid
i see
how long have you had the idea?
this campaign is a pretty damn good one ngl
yeah
it wouldn’t be fuckin daunting as hell
read the new bits every week
see if milo or the rest just
rly, that’s actually pretty sick
i’ll read it when i get home
theres more?
yeah prob
gang members coming up from compton?
someone get shot or something? 
wtf
oh so you took it for the ez credits
yeah, sor. I left my phone charger at my boy jonah’s and literally stopped for 2 seconds to get it
also im literally leaving sc rn
why do you have to take art history anyway 
do it tomorrow 
fuck art history though 
lmao
okay cool
wait thats the skyrim term lmao
and safe houses would be discoverable with shadow marks i assume
cool
k
helps to plan missions around 
also itd be cool to know where the guild is located but it doesn’t need to be pointed out
just for reference 
and 2 penny’s home street
1 the bar where some of the old gang members work
sometime becore next session, i wanna work out where a few things are in the city
oi eric
glaives were probably just for killing horses now that i think about it
halberds were for dealing with armor, glaives were not very good at that
yeah but they have different purposes
i think it’s very funny that glaives and halberds are the exact same thing in 5e
nice
it is
yeah
so 2 handed is a d10?
doesn’t it do a d6 when onehanded?
which i’d say is pretty valuable
my rapier does leave me with a free hand though
yeah
if you try hard enough 
anything can be thrown
nvm 
oh
actually my unmasterworked rapier is the same but better
longsword can do the same thing better
yeah was boutta say
oh that spear?
but thats fine
it’d be better if he was an artificer
he’s a TN bard that shit was made for him
or milo?
parsa?
thats better than nothing
parsa’s TN
fuck rly
i’d give it to milo and kill myself
kms
lawfully evil
im lawful
i want it on everything 
i want that infernal steel man
yes
yes
but like anything we can do to our enemies can and should happen to us imo
sounds balanced to me
makes sense
unless you’re a blaster wizard in 3.5e
melee attackers get to hit harder in the long run
it does give ranged attackers an advantage but so does everything.
that doesn’t make sense 
but you cant run at a dude and then surprise grapple
like you can surprise grapple an opponent 
i wholeheartedly agree with that
no moving.
well you can only surprise attack someone within your immediate attack range
cause they’re barbs
barbarians get disadvantage
second should be harder
so basically my idea is two checks, one to hide and set up the attack, then a second stealth check to attack 
but we’re attacking from an angle that they wouldn’t expect 
or just like casually walking down the street
yeah that’s what i mean
i got a different idea. All surprise attack calls have to succeed a stealth check in order to actually get the surprise round
that works too
but like you can rule it case by case
that way you can punish murderhobos for attacking someone ready for it
highest goes, then roll initiative 
actually its not modifier it’s score
if the targeted person gets to hit first
well just use dex modifier to determine
just whoever says “fuck it, I attack,” gets to attack. Then roll initiative 
not a surprise round
you get your attack off if you initiate combat with an attack
OR
i kinda want my goddam surprise round
if they aren’t ready and we literally waited on a roof for two hours to jump someone specific 
but i mean
im cool with that i guess
in the end it rly only matters if both attacker and attackee are nearly dead
i just like fire emblem’s back and forth thing
well then at the end is fine
so i think it should just be 1
you can’t even multiattack on an attack of opportunity 
people with multiattack?
who has 2 counters?
maybe once you have like 4 multiattacks it comes after second strike
*strike
i like after first strikr
idk actually 
i think you should
was that a problem?
that way you can punish us for not knowing it
i think tbh it’s better to have the information available 
i’ll just take the compliment then
okay
at a rock solid 1% chance
i think miles and i are equal
parsa’s more likely than jett
jetts more likely than milo
milo’s more likely than me
no way
so if anyone can’t finish it they’re just shitters
and in that regard I think I’m the laziest in the group 
I read it all and it was easy
No
fair enough.
i wouldn’t follow that advice if it was me, but you should just go for it
still my advice is to stuff your dick into her mouth
probably the safest option there
unless you can wear headphones in class
its better than actually listening to her talk, though
just show her her place
then she’ll probably like it
next time she rants just put your dick in her mouth
does she have the downs?
jesus
technical writing?
about
writing is great when you’re not forced to write bullshit
jesus
400
any more than 150 is fucking gay
omg you gotta write 400 words about paperclips
is the minimum
that sounds retarded how many words?
about paperclips?
omg
wait what do you have to write about a paperclip?
why?
most of my writing classes were used to write parts of the book im writing, and when it wasn’t that it was campaign shit
thats not too bad
thats not too bad
hah oof
yeah
but if you saved my life and then bought me out i’d sell shit for you from new york
sure
gets them to join up with us
fucking phone keyboard 
then the rest of the party comes and “rescues” the merchsnts
I could look for merchants to rob, get a couple mooks from the guild and attack them
i’ve got a scheme for that
actually 
or something 
find merchants to save
we just gotta get artisans and craftsmen to sell shit for us
its not a huge issue
same
hopefully milo chose an appealing saint
also true
oh thats pretty good
is it the church of saint Gemi?
the cleric lair is op
my issue is what peasants would go out of their way to go to a specialized church a few miles outside of the city when theres a generalized church in the city where its much more convenient? 
ah so lucia gets a buff
maybe
well i guess we get people to come and pray
we make no money off of it?
yikes
nothing is free
but like fuck it i wasn’t there so i wasn’t there
yeah i honestly don’t know why they decided to commission that
hard agree
planning short term things can happen in session in character 
in whats going on now
we get more invested 
its cause with that endgoal
well here’s why we’re all thinking long term
ezpz
swing by the guild and see if we can land a few contracts
rn im just gonna roll with whatever money making opportunities arise
well it’s important to have an end goal
its an idea of whenever i meet a changeling that takes me to their people
its an idea of whenever i meet a changeling that takes me to their people
the whorehouse idea is not a 1st session idea
no thats a question for when i actually get in game
i mean if some noble dickwad wants beat the everliving fuck out of a changeling prostitute, it better not be one of my changeling prostitutes and it definitely better not be on my property 
we’re all for the safety of the product. Unless you pay me enough.
unless people want to buy one of them
can’t be sending them places
just in house
oh
what
?
especially if any of party visits my whorehouse/blackmail farm
especially if any of party visits my whorehouse/blackmail farm
and we’re going big
but i could either have her think small or think big
be decent 
and im still gonna do it
it’s not but i was considering putting effort into being an actual decent teammate 
if it comes down to it im gonna betray the party to make Red Penny become the duchess
and ngl
i’ve been thinking about it
bards op
better quality tusks, fair enough
oh okay
they cucked themselves lol
400 per tusk?
the two tusks were enough i mena
well
did they end up getting the tusks they needed from derg?
lmao
dank
as in a battle between giant clans?
i wish i did
cause it includes the party
way more
nice finding
wow this guide is pretty fucking great
that's fine
can they climb in?
i see
i like this
Demented Murderer	DM
had rooms
at the VERY least
i thought we
okay
lmao
with the introduction you've set, red penny would probably just walk in there and start going through everyone's stuff without saying anything to anyone
ngl
oh dank
That’ll work
Same
that sounds like a pretty hefty meme
ok
lmao
Oh. Well then with the other recruits
and after the meeting, the month ends?
i see
Have they ever met the woman?
And uh probably not a handmaid
Where are you starting? next session 
sounds good
it does
and im the rat
?
isnt jett the noble
oh
since milo is a paladin
i figured
yeah
or at least a non profitable
Red Penny’s Pussy Playground can be a non-profit organization 
fair enough 
yeah
and give them a percentage 
if i work hard enough 
good thing i can get it legitamized with the guild
i know
we can sell them drugs while their at it
invite the nobles to do the dirty with whatever they can imagine on our grounds far outside city walls, where all their secrets will be safe
fill it with changeling whores
build establishment that is just a whorehouse
everything's finished
okay
gonna add the bonds
okay backstory is done
lmao
I see
fair enough.
so he's not in the know, he just sees a lotta shit
hunt dragons for startup money
probably not dragons or probably not a member?
also is Jack Kelly a member of the thieves' guild?
i mean how rare?
huh
yeah
doable
outsourcing is the future, after all.
i'd def hire some other scrub to do it for me
petty thievery is not up my alley anyway
dank
it's worth
we gotta pay for primium fences
Fair enough.
we want those
yeah
she'd probably be siphoning off a bit of her pay toward guild dues
your choice
but she'd have informed them that she's been hired by someone for a long term job before all this began
would take missions if the guild required them of her
yeah probably
probably permanent contract then
OH
giving contracts vs taking them
oh
what's the difference?
thieves'  
also i guess if there's a thieve's guild she'd be a part of it
rly gay
that's
Kelly
and maybe the jack kenny guy
a few connections with the dockworkers
same gang, coming up with a story for that
the end
Now Missy hates them.
Missy's dad was a surgeon, got contracted by hresvelgs to remove a rune from a captain who had royally botched an expensive shipment. The captain was still alive, and dr dad refused to do the operation for moral reasons. Was kidnapped and forced to do under threat.
hresvelgs are a noble family?
i've got an idea
im putting a completely new face and backstory on the same exact character
ok fuck it
ok
which might be better
idk how this links to milo's story and seems much more like a completely fresh start
cause
also i may have to completely redo my backstory
off the list?
eric do you want me to make people up or just choose some
no, im busy today gotta do it tomorrow 
I gotcha
we should not have free money
good
*what they will
now players do with that information at will
"One of your informant's passes you a note. X rich people will be at Y crossroads by Z hour." 
and it's something simple like
a carriage robbery is a good idea
uh
or break into a house to kill someone
just in case someone decides to rob someone
at least one
another estate
never a bad idea to have one prepared
may be important to have one
don't know
an arena
you prepare session by session
agreed
that sounds pretty dank
currently
but i don't know any wizards
could do that with the help of a wizard maybe
That sounds like something a bit out of my area of expertise
Maybe a bit of blackmail
Missy would be particularly interested in robbery and assassination
several sessions down the road
anyway that sounds like stuff to worry about like
yeah
oh god that sounds like putting up a big red "Assassins this way!" flag.
mhm
but we don't rly want people paying attention to us when we're weak and easily taken advantage of
maybe somewhere along the way we can start fixing up the place
then start strategically eliminating everyone between us and the throne
build or buy an establishment in the city (for me) to gather information and make connections
as long as we've got a place to hoard our cash
then i think we should focus on getting a shitton of money and not fixing the place
if that's the case
you wish
clean money Xd
i thought there were specific people that needed to be dealt with at some point
anything else is a waste of time
in terms of the options that are available to us. we gotta fix our shit up
ok so basically there wasn't an actual choice that needed to be made here
i just work for the owner
but it's not mine
try and clean it up
to sell it
im gonna try and excavate that shit
that said if we go into like a mine and find a portal to the elemental plane of salt
recruiting a whole bunch of assets without knowing what we're trying to accomplish with them is kinda dumb imo
i'm still gonna push for trying to see what we're up against
i mean how much disposable income do we have?
im gonna push for action
so starting with recruiting sounds a bit like running in circles
as long as stuff is happening, and we're not running in circles, i'm good
me i like to make shit happen
and the party won't agree
but parsa doesn't like making decisions if the party doesn't agree
and parsa's a pretty good player who'll make decisions and push the party along
jett just wants his character to be cool
milo is just in it to bool around
and miles doesn't do anything
that i know how miles and milo and jett and parsa play
the problem with that is
so we're forced to go into recruiting
but make it too hard for our limited resources
i suggest going straight into sabotage and shit
they'll do whatever you set out for them
i think making that assumption is pretty warranted 
i know that so far I have and parsa has
they just gotta read the damn thing
yeah
and we need to fix it up and apparently hire a good amount of people
but we won’t have the means to do much with it until we get a boatload of money
i know
and at the very least it won’t be all that relevant for another few levels
not if they read it
no
i’ve been dogsitting for my uncle all week
cause of the dogsitting shit
anyway 
i’ll probably be in santa monica by like 10-12
what time is it at?
im ret
oh
and no
for what?
and help us shoot aliens
maybe in that timeframe you can convince milo to stop playing gay persona
8 mins
i’ve known her since i was like 8-9
nah karen is cool
lol
not my call
server was greedy
gypsy last second arrival assholes 
i got fucked by the
like 11
btw
im gonna be late
no
yeh
like 10-10:30
that shit fun
id be down
im at work sor
hah
yeh
vayne’s better with items
trist sucks
but i hate trist
that sounds dank
demon is a good idea though
warmog gnar is a beast
that is pretty good
lmao
i like yordles plus nid and shyv for the shifter bonus health on gnar
yordles are op man
thats a good amount 
yeah but what about when he’s targeting other 3*s
seraph shojin deathcap tho
without items?
LOL
oh
?
is a thing
vertical jump height
also
that's 20 feet
and going up
by shooting
if there's a wall nearby
you can fly
wait
is fucking funny
that
is it not, though?
yeah close quarters shooter is better
well
if you do that horizon walker would be pretty good as well
with wis and str
though
helps if you wanna play a dual wielding melee ranger
that's true
fucking rangers
and you get medium armor proficiency
fuckin rangers
ohhh
wait did you roll?
you've been rolling well too then
i got full tard rage hp available
35 max hp at level 3
and now im a tanky motherfucker
is i've rolled really well on hp both times
all i know
I guess so
it's nice
where nothing happens
the farmland
uhh
the bruke, where you'll get shanked cause someone wants the lint in your pockets
and nobody does anything right
where the city is always corrupt
you got david
nah it's lit
which. my character wouldn't want to do. we just gotta redeem ourselves
unless we try and escape the empire for somewhere else
yeah if we're escaping from jail and being put on the run it'll probably stay pretty scripted
well
eh
a roof would have been weird
the wall was surrounding a garden
not that out of place in a fantasy world imo
magical burning glyphs to make it so thieves don't try and climb your walls and steal your shit?
i didn't mind that
I guess so
walls?
it would literally never have happened
so we got put in crybaby jail
but parsa bitched
the scene was over and we were free
the king had ended it and adjourned the court session before we were imprisoned
so he put us in crybaby jail
we ended up there because parsa bitched and moaned to redo the fuckin court scene
no
in the prison?
i was dying in the bathroom, so all i know is someone said we'd be executed and jett decided he needed to kill
and then we just walk out
or wait for parsa to do his mage hand thing
we were fine
in fact, the fact that he died like a retard for his retard play makes me like that segment a bit more now
jett just played like a retard
i still think that wasn't milo's fault
and not getting assraped by guards like they were in the prison it shouldn't be a problem
but if jett and miles are doing their jobs correctly
its pretty lame
that's very wizard of legend
i do like the teleporting though
that's kinda cool
holy shit it does
wow
i didn't think darkvision stacked
does it tack onto your current dark vision?
i fucking ate chicken and now i have ebola
nothing
also im sick and dying
you can also push hard on that "i fucking hate drow" shit
you can also push hard on that "i fucking hate drow" shit
with the gloomstalker flavoring
that said if you like having your big fuck you moment right at the beginning of combat, then like go for it
thats what i think
turn 1 ambush is lame in long combats
will do
management sucks apparently
nothing is set in stone
idk
or later
yeah.
no
100%
if that happens i'm killing him and giving his soul to sporaghor
i'm THINKING of killing him, but only if we get in a situation where we're absolutely fucked.
in character
cause he's a fuckin little bitch
was that parsa used the FUCKING portal coins to throw away the very useful necromancy coins
where we left off
but he did get in
he had to beat the dude over the head to get in
yes
and you gave us those coins to place around to fuck shit up
the city
fucking kill me
we snuck into uh
that's fine
EIGHT?
8?
you can tell everyone im jacking off idc
im busy
i have 10 minutes 
later
but exploration makes sense i guess
dude just do whatever
(puke)
yeah
cause it was stupid as fuck
yeah
my mental is broke af tho
oh, more or less
yeah, it's not like im going anywhere
for tomorrow?
understandable 
a lot of people hate low level shit
tbh i don't think that's too hard to find
they have 0 handle on any situations
completely true
and the dog’s leash got caught on the mirror
knocked me over and dragged me and one of the dogs like 10 feet cause the dumb bitch was scared
earlier
shit
p o s s i b l y
its not that bad
nah i didn’t go
feels real bad
might have broken my foot n shit
while walking my dogs
like actually hit
i got hit by a car today you do it
nope
nah her outfit is just stupid
cause rn she's the odd one out in the freljord aesthetic
they better change ashe's in game model to look like she does in this fuckin comic
lets see this shit
alright finished walking my dogs
but that doesn’t mean they’re cool
yeah
nice
and nobody knows
so lissandra is just the omegabitch 
but even more immortal
lissandra is ice sauron?
so
is the fact that taliyah lived there for a bit for no discernible reason
the only not lame part of freljord
freljord is so lame
but
but
but
but
but
but
why does it have a glossary?
thats 20%
i’ll read 2
but the writing gets much better  as it goes
cause its one of the dude’s first story
the first couple chapters are really really fucking iffy
in worm?
how far did you get?
its marvel, who’s got a shaky track record concerning story telling to begin with
cause first of all
thats not even a half decent comparison
2 picture books are for kids
1 no it doesn’t 
i’ll read the first two pages and if it doesn’t grab me by there i’ll stop
how about this
professional doesn’t mean better
definitely not
theres a lot
oh
it’s a webserial, deconstructs the superhero genre and makes it really really fucking good.
nah if you’d read worm you’d understand 
i’d rather read worm or ward
don’t have time for that
its a lissandra comic?
cause ashe is boring 
no
oh eric, thanks again for driving me back to the train station last night, that was very cool of you.
heading there though
not yet
im busy getting drunk 
nope to going home
nope
understandable 
play with milo
idk
so
between 4 and 8 for the movie
we’ll probably hang out both before and after
rip
oh
no im doing that tomorrow 
no FUCK you
im at work but there’s nothing happening. Prob gonna leave soon
N I G G E R
?
i know it wasn't either
shoulda said that before you fucked off
hell no
you fuckin monkey get on.
oi
Legs
work
?
and the dude's a petty mutherfucker first and foremost, so that's not worth
but then he wouldn't be able to talk for like a day
or he could shut up and make her fire a spell
and like, make her move and do things
but he can't take over
she can't stop him from talking
neither of them are strong enough to fully overpower the other
cause he's too weak to actually take over
and is very upset with the whole ordeal
and can talk
is a demon hunter, except the demon inside is completely aware of what is going on
yeah basically what im suggesting
he'll be depressed as fuck
so when he comes out and realizes that he can only manifest himself as an imp
and it'll be a chain pact
and he wants beer
demon will be offended at being served milk and shit cause the girls 12
it'll be great
the dynamic is supposed to be very drastic
moreso than the rest of the demon hunters
like the doomlord azgoth tho
yea
regardless i'm still gonna be a 12 year old girl that speaks like a male adult demon
but that could work too
i was thinking of it being more of a symbiosis
i guess so
shitty demon couldn't 1v1 a lvl 20 pc
yeah that's the point
well that's what i was suggesting
girl is LE demon is CG
demone is LE girl is CG
the demon makes the decisions 90% of the time and the girl just confirms or denies
but mainly the demon
both
sure
like annie but without the bear, i guess.
so it's a demon trapped inside a 12 year old
metaphorically ofc
and then the demon tries to cut a deal and is eaten
then, either team could find a box containing a shitter level devil that's been trapped in a box in the temple, or she could just be visited by a shitty demon that thinks it can take this little 12 year old's soul
daughter Tobin learns of it and vows to take vengeance
It'd be ez, too. Etan ints and dies in combat as usual
*the pc
and the daughter is just a vessel for the patron
where the patron is the character
but with one added twist
and no sorc levels
just a fiend patron warlock
it's technically the same character
cause that is what i had planned on doing for a while. 
and then swap to his daughter
can i kill my character next session?
yo eric
what the f u c k?
w a i t?
i do have some african in me
i walk fast
im in the village 
and you can train your shitty dog not to pee and shit on your stuff
and your clothes 
but you can wash yourself 
maybe
now because i walked past two black women, can you tell me why they always smell like fucking dog piss
im on jefferson
dash is for fags though
fuckin dash maybe 
no good ones
how fucking trashy usc is
considering 
which i cant promise 
15 mins assuming no altercations with the locals
more than far enough 
this shits fucking omega gay
i know.
yes
if you cant afford a city service that is basically free?
but apparently you guys at usc are too trashy to afford bus stops
and i assumed it would turn back to vermont to hit all the usc stops
and just didn’t stop for 10 mins
and put me on fucking normandie
*right wtf
because the bus turned left
37th st walking to vermont then to mcclintock
idfk
i’ll check in a sec
yeah
until i make one when game starts
and they probably won’t have a decision 
you can put it out there
i finished making snake bitch's stats, gear, and feats so now im gonna go the fuck to sleep
you've got a while to figure it out
wow
okay
or getting all
are we choosing one?
of these guys
so
sounds good
actually nvm no
also our warlock is just a strictly better warlock than me
what a fucking layered meme
and then used the traits to describe dar's retardation?
and replaced it with something that uses his name format
wait you got rid of the name dar
lmao
you put dar in there?
marsspeaks@gmail.com
the simplest shit ever
like protecting or reclaiming a village 
yeah
which would be lame
but then we wouldn't be using half of this table you made
very true
so we can't have that
except then we'd be the army's shitters
and never upgrade it
just get pikemen
yeah ik
eks dee
i think we should spend as little money as possible on troops and just have them scout
i like that
is draw a dick
the first thing im gonna do
but you know me
that'd work
omegalul
and we lose our shit
then our troops just die on their missions
and if we don't
tbh i thought you were gonna make us keep track of it.
sounds like bullshit
managing that for 5 people
but yeah i get you
yeh
she can barely control her own hands
tnesi?
which is the person with the highest charisma
i think you should give command to the party face
so do we have to fight over which heroes we're gonna take on?
lul
i just want to know how it works
because it's your army, dude your rules.
i won't question it if you just say yes
before you answer
and
with heroes with troops beneath them?
5 people acting as a single officer
are all squads set up like this?
is 
my only question
think of the arguments that'll start
oh god
and the heroes are per person?
okay
or are they for the group?
are the troops we have per person?
also
esp for story
i think it's good
parsa's stupid
okay then
just the ones we have
so not our names?
what is the hero names row for?
will decide when i get home
cant read on my phone
giving me aids already 
ew google sheets
and as for drawing the spreadsheet idfk, just do whatever makes sense in your head
if you’re making the sheet to keep track of shit
slides is better actually, since you can make a page per character, then copy/paste the completed sheet on each one to edit separately later
or slides cause its the same shit
easier to do it in google drawings
google sheets is fucking gay
what are you using?
yeah exactly 
which would equate to ranks or something 
so they apply and we can pick one every two or so levels
like upper management could baby us, vix and vilenariel etc limits the amount of soldiers and veterans in our troops
*adventurers
or you could have our troops be limited to level somehow 
you could randomly decide yourself or you could just ask out of character 
i guess we should have them based on merit or them hearing of accomplishments and they just show up and ask to join
i see
the adventurers?
big cancers 
yikers those random spaces
i see
adventurers would just be standard spearmen that didn’t die
basically 
ok
and i guess we pay them per mission as well?
just buy all of them
oh you meant
you should be able to buy ones to replace troops we’ve lost
well yeah
that’d work
yeah
many apologies 
sorry
wtf omf
i mean, when etan dies obviously sporaghor won’t message
cause next character will be fiend patron
at least until etan dies
okay
i probably didn’t need to know that
jfc
lmao
cool
skype fucj off
hfs
That's what I do
a promotion???
getting
we
are
wot
to do some scouting or exploring 
it makes sense
i mean yeah we just took a city
i think it’d work well, considering we’re basically guerilla soldiers, which means a lot of needing to always be in the right place at the right time
time sensitive sessions i think are the way to go
meaning we can’t just rest at every opportunity 
with the battle above and the heat inside
i think last dungeon was really good with putting time restraints in place
oh btw eric
cause her pathos-laden daddy died a shitty meaningless death in some cave in the middle of nowhere?
sells her soul to satan in order to gain the power to kill everyone in the black empire?
cmon bruh
why is it weird to want to play an 11 year old who’s possessed by satan?
oi
an 11 year old
etan’s daughter
who would be
id just reroll into a warlock 
i don’t care
to make sure everyone keeps their word and i don’t get anything 
now, next session gimme the reward and immediately kill my character in combat
been waiting 
capital int or just regular 
lmao
 no
i like it
still vines are close enough to tentacles
*gross
that's fuckin gros
shit
oh
or what
tentacle blasts?
do i get to get some
yeah
yeah
gotta wait for his current tilt to wear off tho
so he's tilted
actually i'll do it saturday morning
and that parsa is dumb
and pretend that you didn't tell me
i will release it
and in 2 or 3 days
hold on to this puzzle information
now im gonna
oh fuck you
i haven’t tried 
except 
sure
lmao
basement is restricted
at the building 
L113
which sci building is it?
yeah
55-56
i mean the time to reach the station is the same
i see the streets
ik the station
never checked map
should reach usc station by like 12:55 or 56
which is the expo transfer 
i think im coming up on 7th st center
idk
uh fuckin
it’ll be fine i’ll shoot up the lobby or smth 
nw
dont know, leaving now, educated guess says around 1
yeah
clearly not driving is the correct answer 
to know wether or not to drive
train
ew paid parking
also, where, and is parking free?
i’ll ride over
when is this shit?
that sounds like horseshit
it's 54 minutes for me
you're driving
esp in indoor pools
but swimming's aigt
tanning is cancer
fair enough
just wondering
why that in particular?
a requirement to be added as a full member of your family over there
unless pure blood taiwanese is like
as long as your wife isn't a feminist
idk if this shit becomes legal, you should be fine
which will only get easier to get
and not stifle it so it doesn't go hog fucking wild in its teens and od cause of bad influences and the relative ease of availability of hard drugs
then you just have to raise the thing semi properly
mhm
feels rather bad man
so i guess my kids will be retarded no matter what
ahh
so i can make my kids not have to be black
we should just shoot up all the libtards
who cares
hot damn
and im not marrying a nigger
my mom's half irish
i do
that's wonderful
holy shit i get to make my kids white
oh so they can't cure downs with implanted embryos?
but once they cure the downs, what downies am i gonna laugh at?
that's cool
i mean
right
cause that shit sounds boring as fuck
nor will i ever
i don't
do you ever read academic papers when you don't have to for classes?
[1541228298] Eric Huang: i need stuff happening

&lt;&lt;&lt; its like you read books the same way people watch marvel movies
but he could have done more
i think that's okay
i noticed that
reading that shit burns me out
im saying more chapters like dalinar's flashbacks to his drunken glory days
and show more of it
im not saying he should show the recreance
but there's too much stuff happening in the present
it does
and more flashbacks
*paralogue chapters
i'd have less problems with stormlight if sanderson added more of those paralogue chapters
i think
that said stormlight is much much better than catcher in the rye
there isn't a book where nothing at all happens though.
technically yeah.
like who cares if a bunch of nameless soldiers and a couple really shiny nameless soldiers manage to survive a gruesome fight against an army of nameless crab soldiers because a bunch of nameless dudes carrying a bridge decide to go back and save them.
stories are about people because events wouldn't happen without people. events are only relevant because of the effect they leave on people, otherwise you wouldn't care
but it's good because it portrays its character perfectly.
it's boring as fuck, don't get me wrong
and it's one of the most critically acclaimed books ever written
2 things happen in catcher in the rye
like
and the player needs to have some agency within the game
games and stories are different because games need to interract with the player
stories aren't games
but that's getting into psudeo-spiritual bullshit
but made into thousands of scenes and characters and ideas.
like a piece of the author's self.
the point of stories is to try to express things that can't be expressed in words, with words.
definitely not
yeah
numbers aren't themes
10 isn't a theme
right i forgot he set all that shit up
at least
i'd say bring that up to 12
and just take place over more books
and i think it should slow down
i don't think a lot of the events need to be in there
like
and that stormlight needs to chill the fuck out with it's events per book
i still stick to my opinion that its pacing is perfect
for you maybe
like, dumb people just want to fuck and get high most of the time
like, dumb people just want to fuck and get high most of the time
and have money so they can buy expensive shit
but i dont know if that's a fantasy that dumb people have?
yeah probably
makes the normal reader want to see him fail
and the fact that he feels grand for being brilliant
the fact that he's a lazy asshole and thinks he's the shit does.
that said the fact that he's a prodigy doesn't make him a good or compelling character
pretty novel for a bunch
yup
yeah
nope
since the only things that you can actually enjoy is the action and there isn't much of it
in that case
well i can see why you wouldn't like it
so
i don't
nvm i can see why you don't like it
pretty spot on
yeah
wtf why would you not want a character to be relatable?
so
kvothe ain't normal though
it makes for a more human character
because they're relatable
that's why they're good....
shallan is good in terms of flaws
chocked full of flaws
he's a fucking piece of shit through and through
young kvothe at least
actually yes
well
nope
and you're doing a good job of explaining why
also adolin is big gay
because she does have her shit together and she has it together consistently.
in the scenes with jasnah, she completely takes over
you're right about that
yeah but forced drama is called melodrama
and if the characters aren't otherwise usually portrayed as the smartest, wisest, or most capable in any given situation
i'd say yes if it was done less forcefully
but it does apply to kaladin and shallan pretty often
isn't precicely dalinar
which
by making his characters ridiculously stupid without too much reasoning
and giving you a bunch of life lessons
it sounds like the writer is treating you like a kid
when you state it so plainly
the thing is
just means the breakdown that makes me switch will be stronger 
yea
*now
well even better that im against it no
ic
lmao
cause you’d be fucked
good thing you didnt say earlier
this is more like it
🤔
a pussy made of balls tho
neither of those are pictures of niggers
uh
smd chink
i did tell you
ik
outside with dogs
i am not just yet
nope
show up like a wizard with a fantastic game at some company’s doorstep and say “pay me, bitch”
and yeah that makes sense
fair enough
got anywhere you’re planning to work after you finish this school shit?
for your last year
that’ll be cancerous
so annie’s going to usc too
thats pretty fucking solid
and that you have a parent who works there right
based on sat scores, right?
full?
im counting family paying as paying
scholarship?
feels motherfucking bad
to do it
youre paying 60000
instead
eks deeeee
lmao
in code
write that on the assignment 
oof
just pick one for stats then
okay
cause on this wiki page none of this shit really fits
yo, for backgrounds should we just do whatever?
with 6? a while
maybe if we're hitting prestige classes or smth
yeah
well
this could be parsa
if we find a jian
this is fucking edgy
edgy would be this
that's classic horror movie shit
that ain't edgy
i can be my dude's daughter
at least i know my next character
ay
c a n c e r r r r r r r r r r r
that one looks lvl 1 as fuck
maybe the last one
not lvl 1
but they look
i've got a few
long ass background that never gets used
lul
also well done?
sorry eric i got too into this campaign and wrote a long backstory again
it was pretty fuckin cool
i did
yeah
i can imagine
that sounds like some rich people shit
never heard of that one
oof
kneel?
my mom's barely black and even she's smacked me once or twice
did your grandparents hit you?
that's pretty weird
but it's not weird rare
tbh it's pretty rare
well
i don't even go on 4 chan and know that
everyone knows that
/b/ is cancer
which is good
transitioning from a /b/ro to a /fit/bro
you're more like
you're not a normie
also
why?
i guess so
lol
what
yeah
bitches wanna fly cross country
christmas and thanksgiving coming up
it's trapping season
that's it
don't give her money when she asks for it
for no reason
cause she lies
that i'd steer clear of
that's the type of bitch
lots of sense
yep
funniest shit i've ever heard
"Isn't that deoderant"
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
HOAMADFUUADS
alright
oof
okay
oh
oh ok
this is the subclass
The Great Old OneExpanded Spell ListThe following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.Spell Level	Spells1st	Dissonant Whispers, Tasha's Hideous Laughter2nd	Detect Thoughts, Phantasmal Force3rd	Clairvoyance, Sending4th	Dominate Beast, Evard's Black Tentacles5th	Dominate Person, TelekinesisAwakened MindStarting at 1st level, you can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. Additionally, the creature does not gain the ability to telepathically reply, despite you being able to speak to it.Entropic WardAt 6th level, when a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.Thought ShieldStarting at 10th level, you have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do. Additionally, your thoughts can't be read unless you allow it.Create ThrallAt 14th level, you can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is charmed by you until a Remove Curse spell is cast on it, the charm condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
oh shit
the daughter you say?
oh
don't really know
or archfey
the great old one
i was thinking going and striking a deal with one of the eldritch horrors to help them take down izoldi would be pretty cool
but i didn't know which one to pick
well i'd need a patron
yeah
fuck
im not about to play warlock without metamagic
im just dipping into sorcerer for some fuckin metamagic
no
and gonna go into warlock
im a sorcerer rn
*help make the multiclass
actually i wanted to ask if somewhere around level 4 you could help me out and make the multiclass make sense
yuh
and just fucking make everyone stand still and be blinded and proned and confused so that team always has advantage
i just decided because i was playing warlock and had access to hunger of hadar i might as well grab some more control spells
no
yuh
so im gonna cc
im playing cc mage
regardless im not doing either of those things
yuh
and less convoluted
cause that's less buttons to press
so you can attack, smite, then quicken into a disintegrate or smth
lmao
sorc paladin
no
seaming hot shit
just in the wrong way
and they were right
people were talking about it like it's the hottest shit
nvm that's retarded
coffee lock means i can't use mystic arcanum spells
oh wait
anyway
and thus getting less value
and more potential sorc points
cause i'm using up more slots
cause that's gay
and a few other modifiers
with agonizing blast
yes
and never run out
i could start consuming saved spell slots en masse for sorcery points
if we ever come into a scenario where we just need to pump out lots and lots of damage
but
anyway
so most of the time i can just use those, and my primary damage would just be quickened double eldritch blast
which means i'll have warlock slots
usually between fights there's time for a short rest at least
but also why i was thinking of doing it for the luls
thats why i was thinking of not doing it
its true
you're ok with me breaking resource management?
cause i'll have the slots to just do whatever
or if i run favored soul and just greater restoration myself
not if im an elf
so with warlock slots that come back every short rest, you can do this indefinitely
sorcs can convert spell slots to sorcery points and sorc points to spell slots
unlimited spellslots via sorcery point&gt;spellslot conversion and never ever sleeping
and do you mind if i run a coffeelock?
eric how hard are you planning to go for the combat?
i can't find it either...
oof
minus Ai who was not a dickhead
and their gang of dickheads?
+ the son and the daughter
werent we just using the regular forgotten realms ones?
you're not keeping the picture?
goddammit
you fuckin got me with that one
.
lemme check
thats exactly what i said
that's what i said
19 very soon
well
...
19
cool
1700s american vix’elin
doin a new setting though
he’s
fuck yea
the vix’elin picture’s back?
getting there
with u and parsa?
want me to put the randumbs into a skype group?
sounds good
to fuck with parsa
and suggested naming himself something chance
which is why i suggested tymora
no
i think a tome warlock
also im gonna play a sorcerer, then multiclass full into warlock. That sound alright
and names himself x Chance
hopefully he goes cleric of tymora
the last guy is going cleric
She’s had some rough dnd games recently. and is excited to have a dm who gives a shit
so i’m sorting her as “cool” for now.
but she hasn’t talked like a feminist yet
her picture is greyscale so i cant tell if her hair is half black half white or half black half blonde, but it looks like she could possibly be a feminist?
wants to play a rogue, druid, or cleric
she’s cool
cause grim didnt minmax shit
not
except
named professorfox
wants u to message him on reddit too
the barb druid guy has been playing for 8 years is 24 and is a bit of a min-maxer. He seems alright
and if its not cancer we’ll keep him
so before i kick him i’ll hear out his character 
i think he could be cool
so anime weeb kitsune boy is nice
but yea i’ll give you the lowdown
that shits my favorite game, so i wont stop till i’ve gotten all you niggers to try it
aint shitposting when ur serious 
im not absolver shitposting
i just got off work like 2 mins ago
i can send you usernames
no
kys
cause i start work in 5 mins
give me a couple hours
alright
and another 25% chance he plays a plucky gay arcane trickster anime boy
im saying theres a 25 percent chance this dude plays a tabaxi anime girl and a 50% chance he plays a kitsune anime girl
i dont think thats how he meant it
he typed the word virtuous out of character and pressed send
yea
which makes sense when i look at him
he says he can be anything but usually sticks to innocent, timid, virtuous types
not one i’ve mentioned so far
kick him?
i want to die
i want to die
i want to die
i said yes to this dude and his skype picture is this
lots of people want to play hexblades
also this one
its not edgy, just pissed me off
ik
and just copy pasted that shit
its like he didn’t read the post at all
idk its not the cringiest shit but this was the reply that got me pissed off
so i took a screenshot
cant copy paste on my phone
alright
tell you in a sec
to work
had to get going
oh
ex slave trying to fit in, no class yet and random hero #2, no class
plus a barb/druid who seemed cool
the two that i mentioned earlier
cancer
i have to have full blown conversations with these fuckers cause they cant follow the instructions in the post
fucking kms
he didnt say one
this is paraphrased
"Probably gonna get rejected, I want to join ur group never played dnd never used roll 20 but imma fast learner."
oof
never touched r20
no dnd games played
how are u with noobs?
without commenting
several pm'd
i will though
no
lmao
i can hold out for more
aight
yuh
yep
in general
and other people
ye
so no
we already have parsa
and
the rest had time concerns or wanted to play edgy shit like treachery paladins snd necromancers 
the first is a girl so im pretty sure she won’t be a white knight
the other wants to wait to fill out the group, knows we’re good aligned and has been playing for a while so knows his shit
one wants to be an outwardly kind/carefree inwardly very self-conscious type character, who’s very concerned about fitting in
no classes yet
six answered 
two good ones
do we want more than 4?
ok
who cares tho?
and put it on reddit
imgur
i already put it on imgr
that sounds like some bullshit
this is why i won't change it
yeah
people are desperate to play dnd
already have 2 answers and one person who was honest enough to admit that they'd have trouble staying up long enough.
kms
god
YG
and listen to fuckin
because normal people are boring
fuck em
i didn't say i was the dm
it doesn't reflect on you anyway
why
just cause i already did it
but i'd rather not.
could do that
and i mean i don't think it comes off as petty as much as it does as a request to please be sure you won't fall asleep mid session
maybe, but in the long run it'll make more sense for people when/if there are characters introduced that parsa and i already know and start saying "oh shit" about.
yeah.
*fault
because it was his faukt
for falling asleep
but i blamed atlas
i did
yeah
and am adding the other shit now
oh i made the post
but i didn't think about it
i should have
sounds good
oh shit
we're fucking fighting izoldi
w a i t
which is always a plus
gonna piss parsa off
tbh i like that we're keeping the "elves are better than you" thing
sounds good
or can some not be?
so are all the pcs gonna be black empire slaves?
and it's very apparent what we're fighting and what type of character u wanna make
don't need it to be more complicated
good enough
his brain can't catch up with the rest of his body
he's running too fast
he plays warwick
that's pretty cool
shouldn't have to tell people that
rather than giving him a chance to gain a gold advantage
sets back their adc
killing ez&gt;killing sona
pretty retarded
that's...
tru
yeah but isn't that what i do?
what did he do?
lmao
figured
feels bad, i worked early
no campaign tonight, right?
post made
sure
how many niggas u want btw?
sounds like a plan
and this is the only one getting exodus’ed
i’ve got too many fkn active group chats on my skype
wat do
everyones leaving
i love being mindbroken
or a monk again
*then
i’ll be a sorc them
okay
that motherfucker
after i fucking told him i wamted to make a gunslinger 
parsa’s makinf a ginslinger?
wat
sounds good
so hell no
oh
can i have a rifle
and whats the era of the setting?
how long ago did this resistance start?
yea
so we can be elves?
ok
w    h    a    t
n o   e v i l   c h a r a c t e r s
fuck it
yeah
yeah, why?
would be pretty cool yeah
11/10\
scariest fish ever
i can fucking get down with that
that's pretty nutty
ic
lemme google black empire
black empire campaign?
if you like all that tho go right ahead
you don't gotta do all that
if you're finding making all the maps and shit to be a pain in the ass
also
but yea lets try and keep going
i like the last idea
if he does it again i'll give him the talk and look for someone else
but this is fuckin 5 weeks in a row
i've fallen asleep, yeah
we should drop him
yes
if atlas fuckin falls asleep mid session this saturday
imma be honest
yo
For what?
suck my fag dick
yea cant make that
what time is kbbq with the boys?
eric you have big gay
understandable
thats some good shit
nice
i got what you meant
still w/e
fucking wrong
fucking
not
^
and leave you with a kid that doesn't have a dad or some shit
well personality rating in the long run is about whether or not she's gonna fuck you out of all of your money
milo's a virgin fag tho
don't know her so i can't rate personality or anything
fuck the other girl this one's a high 8 low 9/10 looks.
rip
she looks too good in shorts and a cut off shirt
but everything else is fire
cause i don't like
her nose tilts me
that was fast, ty
wo
i guess i won't make that mistake anymore
i skimmed it but didn't realize there was a soul in it.
lilith's awake?
she doesn't really know what it does though.
even cio doesn't yet
under the right circumstances definitely yes, but as is, it's just a solid maybe
that son of a bitch
so gemi is the one who fucked everything up
ah
Lyreth in Gemi’s favor
i specifically remember a bet between Lyreth and Vilde about that
did gemi ever bag ai?
wait
he had good influences
definitely a possibility 
its better than i thought it’d be
yeah
yes. yes i do.
but
havent had the chance to fully read it
i like just got home
my aunt is a psycho bitch, that's where.
im just fuckin with u
wait its tonight?
this one’s got a little too much going on imo
humans aren't
you're having us be the bad guys technically
but i don't think it's all there
i'll try that shit next time
when my dumbass teams don't surrender
can't stay
that shit’s mine
dibs
wtf
does that mean izoldi is a sword as well?
and is a sword?
nidhe is a precursor?
w8
and he was the most hyped
he missed the first week cause he was asleep
but atlas is a bool
yup
skype auto response is pretty dank
I am curious as well.
lemme try an experiment 
oof
we get ghosted
as soon as im available 
idk
to the same result
i also asked belmont
same
and no
no
he's good
that's big cancer
we definitely can't kill kai
it was a good design, it just isn't
we're so fucked
don't tell me he actually has vilya
hour late but w/e
yeah sure
cool
o o f
does the 1 rerolling apply to the pull, as well?
if i were to make it brutal
yo eric, about that dagger, convergence
looks good
now you can see the whole thing
t h e    r o s e ?
v i l y a
esp around the hilt
but yea its cool
id like it if i could like see the sword better
lots of glowy energy stuff
yikers
i figure we need at least one thing for each item we took, OR that list
good thing you have a thief, a sneaky boi, and several idiot motherfuckers to cause distractions 
but
and i’m the most retarded one
cause party is made up of bools
damb now im worried
cause the magic loss thing
mhm
diplomacy and let parsa flame you for not dying for your ideals
or die
so i guess we just gotta go for diplomacy
so they’ll know
yeah
by viciously slaughtering them
is turn all the eladrin into babies
so the best we can do
yikers
uh oh
oh
actually don’t answer that
they’re all in the jade gardens though, right?
cause they’re old as fuck and bored?
oof
are they still alive?
they’re fucked up
yea man
ok so significantly less broken, sweet
cool
ok
OH
but that’d be under very special circumstances 
and just chain that
i could jump on a fool’s back, stab the fool, leave it in and bonus action dash away, then recall it and attack someone else next turn
or if im very stylish
very true
 true
dash, hide, use item, attack with offhand, or pull back dagger
especially since my bonus action is like 5 different things now
i like, that balances it out
this means i can’t heal on a bonus action if i want to be action efficient with this weapon though
i guess we’re running the charity job in every city
alright.
how many?
yes
j e s u s   f u c k i n g   c h r i s t
it definitely pops out more
nice
OH
oh
did you just change the bg and add the energy stuff?
Hyped
what gay boys
g a y
a hell cloak
or like
lets make Cio’s heresy as obvious as possible 
fuck it
make it a hell dagger
i guess one powerful one.
i mean as long as its not nierya tier im fine
the one single one?
i dont wanna be broken
murder is my middle name
ez
i’ll take that deal lmao
cio would swear herself to this nigga or something once they get him the words of power, cause thats some scary shit 
words of power would be op
yea
just want to know what i know ic
ok cool
also was cio not there or did you play her?
which item do we give him from killing kai?
OH SHIT
oh
its only his if it comes off the continent?
ez
collecting souls?
cio?
lul
but thats my fault for stacking int
but thats my fault for stacking int
i do know that my attack modifiers are VERY low
soooooo
but i can heal as a bonus action
likely weaker
either a dagger or something that makes me invisible.
im working rn gimme like an hour and a half to finish up and think about it
HOLY SHIT
THOSE FOOLS
OH WHAT THE FUCK
can i name the specific thing down to the letter?
anything i want?
whichever’s easier for you my man
oh sick
i missed the loot part
oof, feels bad
oh
like a couple times
like a couple time
or do we gotta plane hop?
so we’re teleporting there?
lmfao
* continent
oh so we’re sailing to the urithuru island
so party got contracted into killing kai so now we’ve gotta get a sword that can do it?
thats for kai?
oh fuck i forgot the trials
and met kai?
yeah
pretty sure yeah
understandable
that was like a month and a half ago
jett’s a fool
thats
what u mean sad?
lol
ive got to deal with this shit
lucky for you im paying for the decision already 
fair
since the shit’s saturday now i’m gonna be going there instead 
but
i managed to swap shifts with one of the dudes here
the blue looked better than i thought it would 
ye it looks good
purple shoulders
yea thats good
also makes the lighting on the pants more realistic
that one’s good
they do look bright
or cover the clothes with a layer of really opaque grey
fade the colors a bit
but light bends expectations a bit
dark is too edgy
please
light
he looks
nice
nice
work gay
yea they changed it to saturday and didn’t say anything 
dont communicate anything
these motherfuckers
unless i get off early
but i cant fuckin make that shit
at least thats what i originally heard from uti
*sunday
it was that i was going to milo and jett’s to watch end of evangelion and play mario tennis on sunsay
well jett’s retarded
that im not going to
that was a plan for sunday
wat
so idk what you mean?
i actually did get hour shifted
que?
?
oh nvm i remember him noe
from
 kai
I want to say an elf, but I also wanna try and do the Izoldi thing, so Verellion imo
yea definitely
and taravangian is big gay
he’s a cucklord
yea fuck moash ur right
wat
i thought it was a side one
is that #4 or a side story
warbreaker?
like a while ago
i already did
that sounds like a fucking riot
so Cio would be down to party with a bunch of angry daughter -hating elves
sounds good
especially with no godly backup
ye
and he had no self-motivation
especially since gemi was the sort of mc
last campaign felt rushed since we just sort of blazed through the main quest
also js, the reason i dont want to head north to fight velenel is cause i dont want to rush the campaign.
so even if we head south we can like keep an ear out for elves
the elves are all over then
cool shit though
yea i assumed so, i only meme
YEW PRAVAAL?
does that include
but most are back
so some elves stayed dead
alright
brb
went to feed my dog
that'd be like
and he's just playing everyone
if i can't research it i'm fucked
it's stuff you said out loud, right?
is it cause of parsa's lore shit, or just cause parsa is a smart cookie and figured it out
that's just the kid
it's literally the shattered plains
that's good
rogue action economy is op
bonus action dash
well yea thats the plan
which is what i do anyway
and only ever attack while flanking
aside from not get flanked
tf am i supposed to do?
i dont have any ranged weapons tho
and i die
my bets are everyone but atlas who made the cleric is shit at combat
yes
to go out for fuckin dinner or smth
and im leaving like 20 mins after i get home
on the bus
nope
it's a nice ass map
she hasn't lied to me
i think she's cool
and then they'd realize that that nigga was the shit
im gonna eat a goddamn burger first
b l e h
lol yeah
im good for 6
which means finding a map of the castle somehow
we’ll try sneaking and killing him in bed
but ok
how tf did i become party leader
idfk lmao
it’s hilarious 
everyone who plays it is fucking retarded
but
the game would be stupid
you don't have to give a fuck about getting big
so if you aren't a scrub
and you can kill people by running into their lines while they're drawing the boxes
it's like slither, but a with a win condition that lets you play really agressively
that isn't trash
you don't even land your qs?
that's different from having a skillshot  that is the size of a jungle pathway that essentially guarentees a kill
it's gotta be like
stormlight can't be live action tho
it's better than harry potter in every way
little witch shit is just some fucking japanese crack head's adaption of harry potter
you can't end a story on a plot development like that
because then it isn't the end of that story
cause then they'd have to take that somewhere
i'm glad they didn't do that
and they're a single klaxo herm?
it's a better story having them die anyway
that's too good of an ending
no that's gay
that's a good as fuck ending
i didn't think she'd get any more development
lul
oathbringer&gt;league
you aren't wholefoods until 8:11
if you're not back within 10 mins you know what'll happen
i'll be waiting
we don't have to wait until 8
theres a book for azure too?
tf
navani, jasnah, lyn, shallan, azure, syl, fuck it
But i’m still a fan of a Kaladin that rolls in all the bitches
But i’m still a fan of a Kaladin that rolls in all ghe bitches
Kaladin and Azure works.
Ok well now that Azure is a thing
that's too normie
don't think i didn't catch that
and there's the cult of moments?
feed my dog tho
i gotta get home and
sure
i’ll also go over character creation with them
i’ll do that
ok
one hasn’t played yet but has been dying to and goes over the rules like all the time and shit
and they’ve all played before
they’re all between 18 and 22
one’s dawson and one’s chaz abd the other two are east coast and probably went to sleep before i remembered to ask names
remembering the names
i was just
all guys, ik
ye
i’ll put em all in a skype group with you and parsa after this session and milo quits
there were some older but i didnt pick em
our age
and most were pretty cool
a shitton did
yea
and i responded to most of em
they replied late
anyway
i said pm me
i didnt say reply
nananah
i told the people to pm me so i already know the replies cant read
all pms
fuck it i'm done.
so i'm picking boys for you anyway
i didn't get a response
you're so lucky you don't have to deal with this shit
not sure about them yet
wow
3 responses already
fuck you bitchass
yea cause its a good ass name
lul
idgaf
why?
ass
luckily you dont know my reddit username
i hope you didnt look that shit up
post done, though
i fuckin hate writing in advertisement-style
l u l
sure
so 4 people tops
how many do we want?
yea sure
im a little busy
not rn
sure i’ll join
for sure
or it was in character
yeah he memed, but it was generally within the confines of the story
i mean
and tried things
yea but at least he was having fun
same tbh
cool
ok
its too bad
shardblades are spren, shardplate is probably made of spren, fabrials are spren trapped in fuckin gemstones
glue in stormlight’s worldbuilding
spren are the fuckin
fuck that shit
they’d just be like “oh spren, lol gay”
or not understand
if you were to introduce them
that fuckin nobody would understand spren
kinda sucks
rip
and that it's also home to an evil murderspren?
yea that's better
nanana i'm still convinced that the big high elf city that you talked about in the west is just urithuru
parsa's guy
you've got the son, the daughter, and the uhhh what's his name
kal wasn't just a slave
is awesome in it's own right
i liked kaladin's flashbacks though
they're better than shallan's
its fucking good.
so i wouldnt have to stop 
bought each book ahead of time
i fuckin
yea man
almost halfway
actually i have friday free too
wait
but i have both saturday and sunday nights free after 5
is my best day
tomorrow
yea that’s unavoidable i guess
oh
his face is too thin if he’s a teen
thats true
oh
hard to look edgy when you’ve got a crown made of flowers though
not all that edgy
he looks good to me
it’s aight
sounds like ass
working with kids
oh man
damage spells
and he only has
jett is our caster
i dont have any
l m a o
i have no idea how anyone could ever combat this shit
if you ever wanna ruin our entire day
yo eric
didnt see, rip
cant
pattern is so much danker in oathbringer
its called edgedancer
in the foreward for oathbringer
i saw that
hot damn
that one
yea man
and then everything afterward
the fight between kaladin and szeth
WoR ended so fucking well
holy shit man
pattern is the retard
some more than others
well yeah
havent gotten there yet
definitely great
yep
d a m n
hot
“dont worry, i’ll be careful not to let our chulls get close”
“that face of yours could kill any man from a distance”
destroyed that thot immediately 
to shallan
“i’m captain of his guard, woman.”
kaladin just gets better and better
fuck that bitch
ofc
over the plane
you read it right?
chapter 34
uh
yea no i do remember that
oh my fucking god
really
i’d totally forgotten
goddam
shallan’s shardblade
words of radiance
shallan is hard
holy fuck, man
im good
me or parsa?
a min or two
im leaving in like
Probably this weekend
its too good
i know
yeah
everything fits too well
thats just too much
the shardblades being meant to kill those spren that make bodies out of stone
fuck, sanderson’s worldbuilding is so good
gonna start as soon as i finish
i have it already
and the voidbringers are the parshmen
H O L Y   F U C K
i fuckin knew that
well yea
her charcoals
or like
is her spren?
her fuckin drawing shit?
oh
where he meets taravangian
im at szeth’s chapter
nvm
well that chapter
im there right now
is it the triangle head motherfuckers?
yeah more or less
i’ll ignore it
but
i saw that for a sec
.
fuck yea
honorspren
yea man
blew kaladin’s mind right there
that was easily the best part
definitely
god damn
that shit was so fucking real
he tried to summon his blade twice
beat the shit out of the kid
dalinar walked into that room and made elkohar his bitch
that was the most badass fucking speech
i read it twice
that shit
man
fuck
god damn
yeah
holy fucking shit
chapter 20?
what
that was foreshadowed like
and sucks stormlight out of their fucking beards
Kaladin fucking jumps to it
i just started chapter 68
67 is fucking crazy
HOLY FUCK
thats pretty cool
so he’s dj’ing the little graduation party 
Jack Black’s kid goes to this school though
they all said pretty much the same thing
little kids giving speeches
fuckin
so they made all 17 of those kids give speeches
it’s a private school
i dont fuckin know
it literally just ended
ive been at my little bro’s elementary school graduation
7
nearly there
im at 55
elkohar is a fucking fool
i like adolin im just messing
very true
completely stump that dumbass adolin
good shit
yea
it probably does
and after shallan returned her soulcaster when she was poisoned
after jasnah’s lesson
i started just blowing through that shit
idrk
man i had to stop reading like just before kaladin confronts syl about his stormlight absorbing shit
idk
that arent rock or teft
fuck the bridge men
well he uses his right
oh
is a piece of shit
by using bridge men
made kaladin’s story interesting
freed dalinar of guilt
lul
fuck you
i should have mentioned that a while ago
sadeas is the shit
im still going so we’ll see i guess
rip
where dalinar digs the latrine in shardplate
chapter 28
uh
jfc
is such a cool fucking guy
dalinar
eric
if you think its cancer i’ll roll up something else
everything is on the sheet if you want to vet it for me
i included a background that wasnt on that backgrounds list in my new character
uh also
i can understand wanting to play a character that isnt op in the numbers sense, but literally nobody knows anything about jett’s character
i mean i guess he didn’t want it
yeah
we didn't
it does get better
you are right
so im reading more way of kings
the bus ride i long
that shit 10/10
bruh
it's a doggy dog world
cause when everyone's zipping around at a million miles an hour
unless they're in a rly high mobility game
he's just strong
he's not cool
he's just a stronger champion
sounds good
i forgot to say it earlier, i thought it was like pretty fast, but damn that fucked with my head
nice plot twist with the whole thing i set up for hansa btw
oh hell yeah
Thand is just the dude's name
cause the trash shoot was stuffed full
my boi jonah’s hallways were filled with trash
sounds like it was cancer
so how's the packing/moving out thing going?
it's
jett's a chucklefuck
i haven't finished making this asshole character
i'll do it tonight
hmm
dalinar's intro
i don't really remember
i'll get there soon enough
will be Jezrien Yaezrial Jezerezeh'elin
that's a good name
I'll name him
i'll name him
:(
I can't
if you'll allow it
cause i've got a focus on con, dex and cha rn
i mean yeah that'd be the type of guy i'll play
alright
alright
ok
fire based?
something big
ok
helps that im a mage too
sounds gucci
o o f
just dont tell anyone
the gay prince
can i be
ok
pretty sure the nigga's still schlept out
Not sure yet
lmao
Yeah we should
he asks what to do
and then
more cancer than what he already is
theres no way it can be
even though parsa changed
i feel like
yeah same
classic adventure
the wellspring discovery sounds like a
lets not do that then
understandable
the “fuck elves” campaign
pretty dank
that sounds
oh okay
wait that was the name of the war?
oh
thats in setting 2, right?
oh okay
alright
do you have events you’re holding on to for the future?
same
dont like force yourself to make up some bullshit to accommodate us
i mean the question of running the oneshot at all is up to you
you’re dm, my dude
its up to you, ultimately
yea, understandable
i like the idea of something unconnected, but the first option is probably easier, right?
if you are tho
like
im down
yeah
not far enough
in combat
be pretty accurate damage trackers?
spren at their most useful could like
meant to say fair
auto response, chill
wo
Then do it
that nobody had any context of
i think spren are a thing you could do, but itd have to be like a totally new setting
nice
fair enough
to another plane and highstorms become a thing we gotta deal with
you could have us like open a rift
highstorms are dope enough on their own
idk
oh thatd have bern sick
but there are too many of them
spren make a bit of sense
that ancilus is fuckin sorely lacking in chulls
i just realized
yo eric
wow i just can't write apparently
Then i guess he'd be an orphan from Velenel
but if there's something there
they'd probably like offer up prayers and paintings and poetry and shit to the Daughter during ceremonies.
cause it'll get annoying
I'll be like
i mean i haven't gone that in depth
i mean, that's mostly so that i don't know lore that you'd want to hold onto for later
like maybe every once in a while the dalai lama dude'll get like a vision maybe, but theres no actual communication
doesn't matter i guess
religious purposes, really. they'd try to commune through the person with the Daughter
and he gets to study and grow wise and shit and practice the magical art of keeping a cold ass monastery at the top of a freezing ass mountain warm
and they'd be a student of p e a c e
only they'd be like 2 years old
or they'd have some memory of their past life as the previous dalai lama
they'd have some sort of connection to the Daughter
it'd probably be like a divine soul sorcerer
maybe they'd have like a specific birthmark
that's cool
i haven't played them
that's not the name of no bitch
so we're working for Silas Nyron?
that's a fucking oof
he said he's good
i haven't seen anything
that was the coolest fight scene i've read in a very long time
she's got room for improvement
and it's good
like the most nobility we'll see might be like the mayor of a town or the lord of a small city?
so we'll be in with the commoners for most of it
so i get the feeling it's pretty combat heavy
it'd probably be like
i'll probably build full combat monk
like he's not gonna not fight
he's not a pacifist, he just wants peace and prosperity for all
i'll figure that out
i'd probably be from like the mountains to the north
for ancilus, do you think it'd be fucking stupid if i played a monk who tries to avoid combat as much as possible?
she's getting old, right?
hope it's easy for her
is it a wow character?
lilith
who?
definitely true
yeah
i didnt say parsa cause that shits obvious
tf did he do?
why’re you tilted at milo tho
it was the same with milo and bracchus
yea
lmao
but i see where ur coming from
dont
i mean
rly
yoinks
waiting so long for what?
yo if i get the underworld of ancilus at my back can i throw an army of orphaned street urchins at lilith?
arcane echo goddamn
thats not even it
oh
the 3d12 lightning
whoops
What are they called?
but there are more good possibilities 
and the bad is deep shit
so the good is alright
i see
lmfao
oh you dont get to aim it?
js
the magic missiles one is fucking hilarious
it looks not stupid in comparison to like pretty much every table out there
i didnt mean that as a clap
oh
l
it looks surprisingly not stupid
did you write this yourself?
k
rip
not far
pretty fuckin strong
thats
oh okay
oh
idk
ik
and calls himself the last elf
can i be a human that tapes elf ears to his ears
imma be an elf
fuck being human then
well
ok
i’ll figure that shit out
sorc
ty for a good reaction to my meme
im just meming
lmao
if that sage was jet li
but like
sure
or at least a caster thats stylized as a monk
than im gonna be a monk caster
if im playing caster
sure
i could be one
if nobody else rolls caster
rly
i dont come up with new characters every 30 mins
im not parsa
idk
thatd give everyone cancer
maybe i’ll just be eao
or sorc
maybe i’ll roll bard
maybe
ill probably roll monk
nah
i’ll get around to it eventually
no
we’re gonna whoop that bitch ass
yeah yeah sure
dope
some epilogue
as long as all the characters get like
yea
makes sense
cause if i miss the first and hit second i’ve lost the advantage from being hidden
oh
oh ok
so the double hit is only with sharpshooter accuracy?
oh
that's not what you sent the first time
that's a sister
they're just flying
because it's the one that makes it look like they're fucking
but my aunt's taking me to go get lunch
im going to kill jett's character
at least it's not
it'll be paradoxes and violence
i'll just make a god name list
lmao you're
it'll cost you nothing
humans don't
i think it's suitably dank
it'd be arcana
i'll figure it out
just because you have a jian as a pet doesn't mean you don't respect it
cause then i'll just befriend a jian
same
yes
naw nigga
it could be more worthwhile to make weapons from that but like
magic nullification
it’s exactly what we need
we’re taming that nigguh
nah i get +12 to animal handling
i probably won't have a ton of magic resistances in comparison to like mundane damage
a solid point to build off of
i like that idea though
as they advance technologically
magic in humans is dying out
not much
a little magic
human is just an all around race
most races will just try to advance themselves through any means possible 
some will rely on it entirely
a lot wont have magical capability whatsoever
it depends on the race you’re interacting with
a mix of pure tech, tech magic and pure magic
hmm
no
fuck me sorry
anti nierya
i did
the midgame
tis a good zone
yeah
i can delegate time tho
yeah
ur not wrong
...
so dont say anything
ik
if you do
cause i’ll let him do it
dont tell him i sent it to you
with this
jett just came at me
christ fuck eric
thank you
i’ll use them
anyone who wants to make their own can
i’m coming up with a bunch of aliens
both
i can't be that badass?
can i enchant a dagger with counterspell and cut spells in half on reaction?
he shouldn't care
actually gemi doesn't have anything to do with notcheqir
i'll try to stop him though
he's just openly murderous
parsa's still evli tho
i honestly had to tone down yew's dickery to keep shit civil
it shouldn't
im okay with him playing a dude that's just jett if he represents it in game better
michael didn't say yes tho
i'll try for the maps
i'll probably do milo style cities and just describe them
i just don't know how to do it in roll 20
don't tell me
you can't do that
so he's disqualified
and talks in character when he's not there
it'd be letho
that's dank
so they're too busy
we won't remember
don't info dump please
and they don't sail out to that island and conquer everything tho?
but like she'll def try for help
what's the percentage chance of killing lilith without killing yew?
that'll be fuckin great
i still haven't solved the riddle
i feel like it'd be a good time
you're creating a new pantheon?
cause otherwise we're fucked
you're not doing the thing are you?
whenever it starts i'll give you the whole picture
there's definitely apocolyptic magic
it'd be more like if you have a fly spell or a jetpack you can maneuver, but if not
you won't spend most of your time in spaceships lol
you'll be hunting artifacts and killing people for personal gain
that's what it's gonna be
and is dumb enough to just smile
that's fucking awesome
i’ll just be a wuss for a session or two
it’ll be chill
ik
that's much stronger than i'd rather start
i'll grab the expertise
i do see it as a riddle now that i know it's a riddle
i didn't even know that it had a riddle?
i haven't
it'd be double colossus slayer tho
i mean if he's damaged i get colossus slayer anyway
even if i don't have extra attack
so like i'll still be getting my sneak attack
actually that's tough
i'll probably take another rogue level for more expertise
if it's 10
yea man
then i’ll just wait for lyreth to pick up nierya
then you take over
i’ll cast 3 times as yew
sounds good
thats quite dank
ye
yea
i thought its cc capability was just death
like
is power word torture even cc?
he just does a lot more damage
yep he is
k
i guess i could crowd carius
yeah
gotta be out of teleport range tho
crowd angels carius
right right
i guess
gemi and carius &gt; angels &gt; crowd
well i have a few seconds
i see
isnt it a wis save tho?
do that
i could
and make him reroll a control mage
kill gemi
i could
huh
im just gonna shoot for as many as possible
how many casts will i be able to get off if i take out the angels first, actually?
then i’ll cast into the crowds
will gemi be on the throne actually?
i’ll stealth away to get within range of the throne and cast there
alright
i see
i’ll take lyreth as soon as she picks up nierya
nah
thought id go to the coronation, get mad for a bit then just start casting
idfk
k
yeah he was a good amount ahead
if letho and cheqir are 10 he’s definitely 10 tho
cause i didnt bother leveling him
how much xp did we get last session?
idk
rip
so like
 and i’d want a ton
arrows of silencing
unless i make like
i mean i’ll take as much cc as i can but rangers dont get much in the way of like anti-magic or debuffs
hype as fuck
yea
but parsa's swap is gonna leave us without any solid magic users that aren't
i think i've sold most of them that yew will live a little longer
well then the character sheet for lyreth is done. i just need to add weight to the equipment and add macros for the weapons
its always been fey
dumb ass question
and shit it means i'll never need fire arrows
this shit's ridiculous
i don't even want to be this strong
can't give that to lilith
i've gotta get that phoenix shit outta me
i mean i clearly don't mind sentient weapons
the girl Lyreth saw this, felt bad for him, and befriended him, but because she was always taking yew's side, she was ostracized as well. and when yew left for the city, she didn't really have anyone aside from her parents. 
yew grew up feeling left out, first cause he didn't have a dad, then ostracized later cause his dad was human.
that'll be so underwhelming at first
it's not
but i'll probably be shooting for 20 dex
i'll work on the stats now
she's pretty standoffish toward people she doesn't know, but opens up pretty quickly.
but i didn't name the actual town
won't recognize yew
yeah that's perfectly fine
yea but that one's visible to everyone
she's also full elf so like
oh that's fuckin excellent
so if im gonna start at the same level of everyone i'd be rogue 5 ranger 3
well i'm starting rogue and then going into ranger after 5 i think
she's gonna end up picking up nierya, right?
i'd rather you homebrew one
can i get a note to leave in yew's room
i don't think bodily harm will do too much
i'll have him use it to enchant something lmao
first thing's first give mirthaal to gemi
so then i'll start now.
i was assuming it'd be like 4 sessions from now
i doubt i'll be able to bring the gods back
okay
still, +2 to hit without accounting for whatever the bow adds if it's magical, and whatever your dex and proficiency are is still really good.
and then you've got the rogues
that's like your parmesean
for like particularly hard enemies that don't have legendary resistances
if anything i'd say the cheesiest would be a debuffer
that's a dumb question
does a rogue's sneak attack apply to ranged weapons?
i'll figure out something
alright sounds good
what better way to get a nigga up and running than to beat their emotions with a stick until they're a bloody pulp on the kitchen floor?
she'll be fucking traumatized yeah
that shit'll be very awkward
i mean i thought it'd take longer than that
since the card bullshit i've had absolutely zero plans for yew
then i'll figure something else out for when whatever happens happens
when yew goes through with this overthrow the empire plan, he'll definitely drag his mom and some others from the village out of the continent so they don't get in harm's way
she probably wouldn't like
so yea she'd take it and use it to kill him
i'll go either chaotic good or neutral good
yew's best friend growing up in elftown or whatever
and go with the Lyreth character from Yew's bonds tab
i'll still try for the harder option. just cause it's more interesting that way
i mean i'm 100% fine with letting either option go down
yea that's fair
cause it's better if they think im 100% on board with fucking everyone
i wasn't gonna say this in call
he's an evil dude but not that evil
and find a way to re-seal lilith's soul
yew's goal until he loses control
that's not okay. fuck that guy
gilderion is someone we don't know, correct?
they're strong but not too strong
they won't have a choice
but yea i'm fine with that
just for gemi
i need the spell silence
oh god
i see
its not rly a combat scenereo as much as a political one, right?
thats fine
but ask memelo
i can
yep
feels bad the bitch died though
it was pretty dank
y i k e s
i'll make sure to tell him about the journal even if i die
that's all he wants rly
and then on top of that he's blinded
i'm not staying within the map
i'm probably just gonna take utility
what's his con?
i'll just keep the imp shape shifted as a raven
pretend she's a cleric
i'll choose a symbol of the raven queen
can Xolruthar's amulet be an arcane focus?
TraitsShapechanger: The imp can use its action to Polymorph into a beast form that resembles a rat (speed 20 ft.), a raven (20 ft., fly 60 ft.), or a Spider (20 ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true form. Its Statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted. Any Equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.Devil's Sight: Magical Darkness doesn't impede the imp's Darkvision.Magic Resistance: The imp has advantage on saving throws against Spells and other magical effects.Variant: Familiar: The imp can enter into a contract to serve another creature as a familiar, forming a Telepathic Bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the imp senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the imp’s Magic Resistance trait. If its master violates the terms of the contract, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending the Telepathic Bond.ActionsSting (Bite in Beast Form): Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.Invisibility: The imp magically turns Invisible until it attacks, or until its Concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any Equipment the imp wears or carries is Invisible with it.
and it doesn't
as long as hunter's mark doesn't give him movespeed toward me i'm good
it'll be fine
but parsa's on there
then i'll guess i'll focus on running away
i just won't let him find out
i'll be fucked
fair
yeah
for sure
so i suppose this is the “fuck parsa’s entire life” session?
same
sounds good sounds good
yep
cool
are we playing clue?????????
r i p
so the mom is already dead
i see
i dont know
cause
good
im in
that sounds like it’ll tilt parsa immensely
by her younger sister
lul sounds like cheqir got outplayed still
older sister?
who would i be?
and is it cheqir’s mom?
is milo playing them?
so i’ll just buy a shield
but dual wielding is ass
cause i wanted to dual wield swords
well at least now i know for sure i'm going bladesinger 
and i don't have a shield
it's an adamantite chain chirt
whenever initiative allows
most of the time
i’ve been frontline
makes a better frontliner
im more of a fan of the ac shit
im not lul
yeah thats still fine
i see
oh
yea but level 4 is also when you unlock 3 blades
thats dank
yea
that's quite dank
they're both very decent
ok so i don't actually choose the perk
who isn't rly that gay
yeah that's what i was going for in the first place
so i'm trying to reach around their guard for a cut
i thought that was just an attack that wasn't on his turn
please don't make it any stronger by making it inflict fear
but you would have all died like 10 times before that so you'd know what's going to happen
milo wouldn't have killed anyone there
cause he's jett
so he won't do anything
yeah but he's also just jett
and there's no way we're giving you night watch
we're all evil
oh he'd be retarded
so i don't ever have to open it
i can't stand that shit
that's surprising
does the chat history request differentiate by conversations?
that's true
he's like a kogmaw
so you're not gonna get to him anyway
he's also the least likely to die
he's both the strongest caster, and the most capable in diplomatic scenarios of the entire party.
i just hope he doesn't
"i, gemi chance, introduce to you... sharknado. in pink."
"i gemi, chance, introduce to you... sharknado. in pink."
"i gemi, chance, introduce to you... sharknado. in pink.
it's more like
cheqir's adamant denial of everything even remotely dangerous is pretty funny tbh
he's at the denial stage
cause i'll just be trying to fuck and party
yea just don't even bring it up until someone scores 10
that's a recipe for success
he's a good player
yeah that's inspiration worthy
um parsa's characters?
but he's been pretty serious the entire way through
Eao's evil too, but only cause she's a selfish, heartless bitch
idk who you're referring to?
&gt;goes to sleep
&gt;takes first watch
that's fucking so funny
*who's is that?
campaigns don't need to end at the level cap
it's not too dificult
but you've got a better sense of balancing than both RAW and milo
if it's strong i'm gonna be stuck randomly killing everyone all game
i'm leveling to 20 in psion
even if you don't want it
you know he's gonna notice that you're not outputting enough damage and give you likke
didn't at all
hell yea
i still almost wanna do the devil one
r i p
only 20
unless there's a
wouldn't that be more like
sorcs don't use int for anything
unless we get the emperor to cheese the fuckin worm demon
that's
too bad yew was born a half elf
for sure
he gives a shit about making it luxurious 
i dropped 9000 on decor
oh hell yeah
i gtg my break’s ending
you can take him then
yea thats cool
so he’s just gonna bask in it for a bit
now he is rich
yea pretty much
and pork this elf girl back home that he had a thing for
his goal at that time was to get rich and take care of his mom
the problem arises cause he died before becoming emperor was his goal
its mostly the second option
bruh idk
no i was saying that yew’s character is fucked so i dont know how to tell you how to play him whe i dont know what’s happening
no im down
oh sure
k
but im working at 3
i can do 4:30
nope
because good and evil aren't subjective to personal views
because it doesn't matter what you say either
if you know in your heart that what you've done is good and righteous, you could still be a steaming pile of shit
it doesn't matter what anyone else says
that's what the other option is
it's like putting yourself between the guy and the girl
no it's not
he's just not
isn't hitler yet
because a baby that's destined to be hitler
and at this point it's just shitty
you're a fucking idiot if that's what you really believe
that's not what a good person is
it's better to give something a chance
no it's not
allowing evil to exist isn't evil
yes but life isn't sure
pragmatic doesn't make you good
that's it
you're a fucking piece of shit
and you didn't try to help him not become hitler
i'd say your're good
if you'd waited for him to become hitler
but you wouldn't be good
you'd still be a baby killer
you're still wrong
and you're still wrong
justifications don't make actions good
but curiosity isn't good
im pretty sure you'd be surprised what toddlers remember
meaning they've done it before and got punished for it
that's what they do
but i've heard of toddlers doing bad things intentionally
when it's developed
that's also not true
it's fucking happened before
you can murder an infants parents right in front of it and it'll laugh because it can't process what's going on yet
babies don't care
it's just neutral
i wouldn't even say the human spirit is good
that's retarded
if history had gone differently and he was executed as a criminal he'd still be a good man
and ghandi didn't do a great deed
there aren't many more
i can't think of anyone else
or is it just
george washington isn't your ideal good person
what you're talking about
and strong isn't good
weak isn't bad
i really hope you're memeing
that's fucking retarded
you'd feel fucking sick
you're a fucking piece of fucking shit
you're not a good person
it just means that you aren't an evil one
yeah that doesn't mean you're a good person
the reason that nobody has an answer is because there isn't an answer
there's a better thing
there isn't a good thing to do there
you're fuckin retarded
that's what makes serial killers
it's not hard
it just means you can make yourself believe it's just
justifying something doesn't make it just
[2/13/2018 12:07:39 AM] flatisjustice: you could walk away and save yourself any guilt&lt;&lt;&lt;this is the objective of justifying something
that's called justifying
that's ridiculous
a fuckload of text
i don't get how you don't understand grey areas
it just means it's less bad
but that doesn't mean one scenereo is good
it's objectively better
no it's still not good
no that's not how that works
doesn't make it right
and you're an idiot
so you're wrong eric
you're wrong
because it's not
you can't argue that it's morally right in any circumstance
it's necessary evil
but it's not good
im not saying that it's not important
i'm sorry man
that's pretty depressing
you're just wrong
it's not
society doesn't mean anything without humans
they're an active detriment to the environment and they hunt everything. Society is only the world for humans. not for the world
it's not based on who or what you are
good isn't subjective like that
imagine you're a zebra
no it's still now
there's no way of knowing that
no it wasn't
and that wasn't good
i'm saying that exterminating a species isn't and can never possibly be a good action
i'm not saying it's ideal
you're just dead wrong here
eric i'm sorry
but dm's don't have to follow the books
means that's inherently not inequal
there are absolutely ways to become a dragon in D&amp;D
except that's also not true
no it definitely is not????
no it's not?
it's removing the person
it's not removing the ability
it's removing the certain beings with ability
in the same way that equality for everyone isn't
and it's not more important
yea but tha'ts not a greater good
killing all people able to read minds wouldn't make life fairer either
it wouldn't
you're correct
and it's still good
life isn't fair
and that's the way life works
and they'd try to help other people
or they wouldn't
they'd kill other people
cause it's a fat load of shit
cause that's how life works
and that's fine
that's not how life works
that's retarded
no it's not
does that mean that's good?
what's the most perfectly just reaction for someone killing your son?
fair isn't always good
like your character isn't defined by your alignment as much as your alignment is defined by your character
and doesn't actually have a bearing on how you act
just because the books say it doesn't mean it's not bullshit
yeah that's horseshit
i don't think any extermination is morally justifyable
it's not
it's just not good in any way
there's literally nothing you can say to win you this argument im sorry
you're wrong again fucko
that doesn't make killing babies okay
that doesn't make killing babies okay
you're not gonna be able to justify indiscriminate murder
it's neutral at best
i still think it's not
it's like having sapient missiles
they're not weapons
they're living beings
yea but they aren't
he's neutral
right now he's not good
that doesn't make it good
that's not good either
cause a real evil dude wouldn't stand for that shit
but that's just self preservation
i'd say vix was neutral
i have yet to see him help people in a meaningful way that didn't involve a sizable amount of  personal gain in some form.
don't just
just don't
i think you're above doing that
please don't pull a godfrey
that's fine
so you're telling me we have 2 slave starts?
it's their actions per turn
it's not that
that shit's so dope
and i'll take dominate person
that doesn't answer the question
(puke) (puke) (puke) (puke) (puke) (puke)
(puke) (puke) (puke) (puke) (puke) 
(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)
wait you're going tiefling?
and i don't even think hector's int score is that low
they're too dumb to be evil
they're like
i rly can't say they are
i can't say they're evil
but that's because she's about as selfish as it gets
Eao's evil
that doesn't fucking wor
you can't be evil and altruistic
he's also neutral evil
and now he's a pirate instead of a bard
he was a slave, now he's not and instead he's a bard.
as far as we know it doesn't
it doesn't
he's like the music players in sea of thieves or whatever
give him so much shit that he doesn't do that dumb shit again
i'd say give him shit for that
but aside from that i think it's pointless, and it's much easier and much less stressful to just ignore it.
they can't
cause it's really not
but i don' see that as a problem
so i don't see a point in making it an issue
it's not up to us really
that's it
since you're not the dm
it's not metagaming tho
no it's not
he hasn't outright asked cause he's a fuckin pussy
i mean he's specifically pointed at wanting that shit to stop
just make someone who doesn't give a shit about that
so clearly that's not the case with jett
but milo hasn't been keeping up to that standard
and we don't
because we're civilized
that's not true
that shit's fuckin
but at least we won't have a party member that despises another because he decided to play a race
im not saying don't do it
i'd still kill him if i met him
i don't give a fuck about his quest
we're just gonna have to have two monks
cancer
hed try to homebrew his god too
i just don't like divine shit in dnd
it's a tanky rogue with shit stealth
but i don't like paladin as a class
it's cool
if i die i'm rolling ranger or monk
that's not too bad
yew is a gigantic faggot but he's not gay
i thought you didn't like memey campaigns
now it's too memey
there's too much
who's we?
i don't see the point in that
idk that's a pretty lame use for a spell called wish
whenever you wish there's that possibility
that's like
that shouldn't be the case tho
like they're not level based
so it's not like anything is gained or lost by using one over the other
i'd be using a level 3 spell slot for both instances of similar damage
so for me it'd be 5d4+5+20
i didn't look at either of their smiles
i haven't started it either
i didn't end up buying anything
it's dogshit
that'd have been a lot of xp
ofc
yeah i mean
but it’d also feel good to fight 5 cr 3 monsters and get more xp cause we rolled like ass and got put through the metapgorical wringer
true
yea i know im just saying you can do it however you want
if a fight seemed too easy you can give out less xp for it
i mean you can technically scale xp however you want
yep
early levels are fuckin boring anyway
its fine
we're working tohether
i've got invisibilty
you're a retard
once again
k
i cant play until 5 either
no
you cuck
and why are you metagaming like a cuck
why does unka want to invent an engine?
and why?
wheres the idea for this coming from
in the world
engines dont even exist
eao wouldnt see the money in that
just use a fucking chariot
im not helping
its coming from some nigga wanting to make initial d memes in eluras
theres no demand for an engine in the world
nowhere
nowhere
yeah but where the fuck is this coming from?
no
...
forgot to change it up top
no im lvl 4
yeah i figured they'd be around there
i don't think wall walking is a spell that exists
that's what i mean to say like common magical goods
i mean the assumption is that it wouldn't if it's being sold to you
and you let natural selection take it's course
not if you don't take them off while you're on a ceiling
if i was that rich, i'd get my kids a coat of many arms if they really wanted one
who don't have any magic in their families
its more like children's toys for rich people
i like the idea of like just finding a bunch of magical items that are shit and you gotta figure out how to make them work
*just
it is jusr a meme
yes
and so they wouldn't have like permanent attunement
like those wouldn't be made by competent wizards as much as apprentices
im not saying they're powerful
tbh that’s what worn magical items should be like unless they're like armor specifically.
tbh that’s what worn magical items should do unless they're like armor specifically.
tbh those are what worn magical items should do unless they're like armor specifically.
or a coat of arms that just gives you more arms as long as you're wearing it
cause they're technically made by lvl 30 enchanters?
i was under the assumption that he didn't
that's fair
your canon for milo's story, right?
who's apparently ridiculously powerful
you know who we know that's most likely to survive the calamity?
oh god
and then boom you're out
so wouldn't running away simply entail one planeshift?
yea but isn't doomsday like for the entire planet?
basically all that means is that you made a character that's a bit of a cunt
no he didn't
and you've been nothing but a cunt to him from day 1
he's explained that it was on accident
no he didn't
nothing aside from the fact that we've just been sticking together so far and nobody particularly minds the other's company
and it might just be because you're the only one who actually gives a shit about what anyone else wants to do with their characters
its just that you seem to be the only one who's concerned about this
he can't say shit about other people's races
and Braccus doesn't seem to care
Eao couldn't give less fucks
since Gaylord's gone
Eao doesn't care
that just means they'll respect you less
so we can't have a leader
yea that's true
and you'll give me fucking cash fucking money
which was that i'll help you rebuild your city
it doesn't mean that either
the contract doesn't make me your servant luk
that's seperate from the actual group
i'll point out that i have the highest charisma
but i don't want it
no eao's fine with landing hits
so what'll likely happen is that pravall will go and finish the job and realize that stealing purely for his own benefit suddenly feels kind of shitty
but that's gaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy
i guess it's just cause he wasn't really making any moves
if it's in character, that's fine. It's just a very soft, pretty passive dude
there's no problem with it i guess
i'd still say that's pretty bitchy
i mean maybe he's looking for his brother cause he wants to
and then there's literally never doing anything of your own free will ever
there's insecure
i think he's a bitch
i think he's passive
it's honestly some of the most boring shit ever
it's fucking godawful
i mean the voice isn't shitty
i can't read "your gods" or "their gods" without hearing parsa's shitty godfrey voice in my head.
cause i know i don't like co-writers or being a co-writer
you don't like making up the history?
if i was dm i'd have been like what the fuck is this
for milo's world
that's the fucking funniest shit i've heard all day
thinks he's the leader?
she hears the things she wants to hear how she wants to hear them.
it'd start getting to her head
don't go saying that shit to her face
i'll tax you for that shit
you're gonna gyp ur dragon
that's
yes but they're still berries
you're...
how much do you think it's gonna cost to feed the dragon?
and you aren't paying it
it doesn't cost that much money
i don't like the picture of it
i've got 6000
like i don't think you're taking into account how dishonorable i am
and if she ever is fighting vix, he won't know until there's a fireball on his head already
she's not gonna be fighting vix though
milo's items
you're just trying to make him look like the picture?
that's not that edgy
please don't
that's so fucking edgy
she was wearing some men's privateer clothes
and you'll just see hundreds of knives
and i'll pull open my cloak one day
i'll have like 500
it's almost an excellent meme
so it's kind of useless
&gt;.&gt;
except i haven't run out yet
it was just so i wouldn't be useless without my spell slots
mine's 1
it's not that bad at all
i've got an amulet and lots of daggers
you're
at best its more like fortunate, in hector's case
chieftains can get their asses beat and be deposed at a moment's notice
hector is a chieftan's son
that's just something she'd come up with on the spot
she doesn't have a last name
Unka might but he's retarded so that doesn't count
Vaughn won't listen to a word you say
who's his crew?
it'd be useful if i was picking more than one spell per level
haven't done it that way once
i wouldn't know
that's what wikis are for anyway
cause they're too busy designing an actual working dnd model to play online to waste time updating their shitty compendium
it's like the player's handbook preview
it's the cut content handbook
it doesn't even have wild magic sorcerer and that's in the base handbook
*roll 20's compendium blows fucking dick
for some stupid reason it doesn't work
you can't copy shit off there anyway
i think xanathar's
that's nice
yea i'll have to triple check with milo
yea it'd just be +4
i guess pretty soon mine'll do 2d10 + 7
you'd need a god-tier sleight of hand roll
and you don't have subtle casting or anything
also doesn't call lighting have a big verbal and somatic gesture?
it wont look natural unless there's already a thunderstorm
what if he's a drow healer?
coerce commoners into helping rebuild vix's kingdom
cause if that's the case, that could lead to some issues.
but other high elves will notice this other dude's energy on me?
so is pravaal's soul now the lost soul of whoever made nierya?
yea pravaal would probably want to go meet him once he figures out he's one of them
that's also fine
that's fine
not entirely careless. he'd care about the people in the bonds page
but as of right now he'd most likely go the careless immortal route
i'd probably just want to figure out what the fuck happened to me, and then go on from there
im a high elf i dont care about the feeble lives of mortals
yea but naw
wow so evil
and maybe makes me kill my mom ooooh
what if by pure coincidence, some outside force decides to try to hurt me by corrupting my sword?
later
or have it be corrupted
im saying later
/ corrupt it?
can i curse the sword?
wait so its the sword?
im gonna accidentally do some terrible shit
so you HAVE to make me chaotic evil
im gonna do some accodentally terrible shit
ughhhhhhh
so yea i guess he’s my friend
gemi’s a bitch tho
i can be as selfish as i want, those niggers didnt do shit
they STOOD AROUND and watched me die
wait
it's just all there
its that i cant be a selfish, self-serving bastard piece of shit motherfucker who has no friends
its that i cant be a selfish, self-serving bastard piece of shit motherfucker who has no feiends
its not that
(puke)
since im good
except now i cant ask for a cut
yeah
but i’ll bring up the possibility of hooking him up with my contact
its not mine
its way more versatile
yea
otherwise its vilya
 nierya is stronger specifically for combat
eao’s just some bitch with magic
lmao
by handing out free shit
like a retard
thats cause milo broke you
well you can only do it so many times before having to rest
lmao
and then just throw a fireball
you just have to wait for him to melee some dude tho
bitchmade shit for the bitchmade uberjew
and take all the gold
then kill the last man standing
if it did eao’d likely run and hide
yea
definitely not with miles
its not gonna happen tho
i mean
feelsbadman
on one dude
what 4 spell slots?
but thats also like
thats retarded
christ
rip that nigga
damn
hold person fireball
goddambit
fuck you
wait 34
lul
hot damb
thats from the fire ring and book right
yep
well ive got one of those
lel rip
tru
ye
but im gonna need to pick up the feat for dual weilding first
he’ll probably end up doing that
one
understandable
so i don't sleep at all
then i'll change it
unless yew go home and yew's mom is like who the fuck are you you fucking creep
specifically cause it's cancer
i didn't have any particularly good stats
wtf
ikr
im here?
i know
what a biiiitch
sure
*eluras
but sunday is probably for eluraa
subday im free the usual time
im free wednesday and thursday
yea
i voted for that shit
its not gonna beat queen vaughan
queen - eao
king - eao
ye
thats further from me then the restaurant is
except
uber
sent something to you thar i meant to send to someone else
mb, whoops
that zoomy shit gave me a seizure
uti maboi
absolutely
yeah
you do the descriptions
im lazy
fine
ugh
ask the other cucks
i dont care
i’d probably be pretty good at that
idc, ask parsa, milo, and miles
^
and then the retard bards who try to charm inanimate objects
and then theres the murderhobo x who’ll kill people and fuck the people’s wives directly after
theres also killing people
also not entirely true
cancer
it's tru
that's
i'll find out
that's
cause pravaal doesn't really give a shit about the fuckers he started using 3 days ago to help him get into the record. 
i'd just make it difficult
and then hunt chequir's hunch
so he'd probably be able to find the dude, and read up on what the necklace looks like in detail, where he might have hid it, where he works, who he lives with. shit like that.
so he'd probably be able to find the dude, and read up on what it looks like in detail, where he might have hid it, where he works, who he lives with. shit like that.
im sure he'd get it by now.
and he's like okay i'll fuckin get you that one.
the rich dude could have been walking through the streets with his wife, and she saw it and was like "wow I want that necklace."
it's just very well made.
and he's not that rich.
it's not that important
maybe poor fucker's precious family necklace, so some rich dude can give it to his wife for her birthday.
that's part of the criminal background
i'll have like a criminal contact that sets up these things
but it isnt really all that necessary 
all that much
id say it doesnt matter
the big top down view
i think if anything i was a little less immersed from the POV
maybe for others
it didnt for me
uh
if you thought it was a pain then dont do it
if you like that shit sure
um hm
oh real quick, Pravaal started like in the early stages of a burglary job. It’s been like 3 days since, right? he’s probably gonna be adamant about finishing it before we leave cinthal
felt like an actual serious dnd session
solid
mostly because we haven't asked
except he has stuff that he hasn't told us about the worldbuilding.
that's not his fault at all.
and they have legitimate reasons for it. that exist in their character's stories n shit
because michael and miles, even though they're a little memey, they don't like just do cancer shit for no reason all the time
idk if tandoori didn't have jett it'd have been better
cause i like Eao better than this cuck Yew
i'm lowkey more hyped for this than i have been for tandoori
don't say this shit to milo
there's some shit in the unlight district
and suddenly he's very interested in whatever they're up to.
so the aasimar and the kenku who've come from far off lands enlist the help of a local scumbag to get in.
in any scenereo he'd pull some mind shit and make them let him in
there's no way in fuck this dude's doing favors for priests
he's a smart guy he definitely researches his jobs first.
where's the cheapest housing possible?
milo's session 1
which isn't bad
well you're going into a whole lot more detail then
cause we'll probably fuck it up somehow anyway
so once he's got like 5-7 hours of material he can stop
milo doens't write as much
he'll show up to keep up appearances though
like someone'll contract him to do it for them
breaking into people's houses and stealing things
cause his school does a lot of bullshit+ 3 hours ahead
he also never has time for anything
call up uti, tell him he’s fuckin gay
idk
diego or david
ehhh
ok
fuck it
dmpc
uh
he goes back to the town and lives there a few years later
explains that
on the actual character sheet
theres a little more in the bio tab
alivive
that's fucking sick
don't know yet
that's elves
Now she's mad at everyone and everything and will take it out on them by becoming a filthy, greedy, evil overlord.
Eao's the daughter of a dragon fucking whore who was born and left behind in a back alley.
And you've got this bitch who was born into gutter trash who wants to be an emperess.
You've got Vix who was born into everything and has no idea.
Vix's?
That's business.
Even though she's practically one herself.
but it's very very loose.
She's got a sort of "do unto others" mentality
eao's got contacts for gems.
if you catch me i'll drop it.
i'll probably pull some bitch shit
wouldn't have had the chance to bring that up in a normal session
so we're fuckin good.
Now when the infighting starts it'll be a 2v4
i don't have a problem with them in dnd
and pull parsa's asterisks shit.
i'll make it as gay as possible
and jett isn't surprised when i fireball him in the face
tryna rebuild shit? i'll help.
"ay, you're a prince right?"
it'd be like
and thats basically what we'd be saying
yea that's what she wants
Eao's having a pretty good time right now.
i don't know why this nigger godfrey is still alive.
[1/23/2018 11:08:09 PM] flatisjustice: but I'm writing in his mindset rn&lt;&lt;&lt;
but he's an edgy teen
but she'd want a percentage
but they don't know what that'll be later
and then everyone knows that's what eao wants
I'd say something like, "look fellas, all i want is a sack of gold on my belt, a wonderfully soft poster bed, with silk sheets, a golden fucking toilet to shit in, a palace, a throne room, with draperies, that have my marvelous horns sewn on them, a land, a nation, maybe a continent."
"MAKE WAY FOR MY GLORIOUS ENDGAME"
but i don't tell them to people like "THIS IS WHAT MY CHARACTER IS GOING TO DO EVERYONE"
and you're writing a story that assumes that he never grows past that logic in 7000 years
it doesn't even really matter
and then i'll eat a tide pod and force it down with bleach.
and then she'll have sex with all the guys
because she's so powerful and awesome and has huge titties.
so he's hitler
yea but that's still a hundred years
i don't see how a hundred year old dude wouldn't understand that one dragon isn't the same thing as all dragons.
i don't mind that at all.
and jett's tomfuckery
like parsa's godfrey shit.
the problem here is that it's not gonna be good moment to moment
that it's fucking good.
i don't give a fuck about a cool interesting and complicated plot.
i don't give a fuck about quests or long overarching stories.
Why'd you do that to yourself then?
cause that's fucking stupid.
are you telling me you're thinking of pulling a parsa?
I don't see the point in planning your epilogue
so that's retarded.
cause the dnd isn't gonna go on for 7001 years
what's the point
cause milo isn't gonna let you do that unless you do it.
you'll have to
i don't fuck around
don't you need to attune that staff?
in a world where you're not supposed to be yourself
he wasn't thinking about that
it wasn't ever that
it wasn't.
idk what jett's character is tbh
idk why you can't understand that bullshit
cause he's a drow?
i don't get why you hate him
but that doesn't mean you need to be a cuck about it
the only people who i can see infighting are you, jett, parsa's old character, and unka cause jett does some dumb shit
good thing hector won't do that shit
it won't
it's a 17
it's not verse my dex
that's still a full fireball
it doesn't matter who
you're the only person who would do it
it's not gonna happen unless you make it happen
why?
in social scenereos
which is assumed
when we need to lie
you can always enhance ability me
plus
we’ll see who rocks diplomacy
in a few levels when i grab dominate person
you cant lie for dick
only for persuasion
plus i take mostly deception spells
+6000 gold
same as deception
i have +6 w/o diplomat
your charisma sucks ass idk why you think ur party face
but milo doesnt write the sessions with just combat in mind
probably
we’re talking about jett
because he’ll reroll into a rogue swashbuckler or something
except he wont
that isnt false
rolling a 1 is not grounds to kill another PC
he misfired
what a concept
wow
you could just not
combat’s cool but there’s more than combat in dnd
thank god
send everyone the world first tho
fuckin go for it
sure
make sure they're connected
that shit's overrated
i haven't read the book tho
just because shit is op doesn't make it interesting
i haven't read malazan
cause i was planning to treat planets like on the same scale that milo's treating the continents
that's the biggest difference tbh
you just don't want the spaceships?
cause when he finds a planet with ridiculous gravity and realizes his fucking 2000 kilo armor can't actually move within the atmosphere
it's gonna be space wizards
don't tell anyone ok?
i don't give a fuck about the dragon
don't expect it to be
if i was dm i'd rule of cool it tbh
trees aren't creatures
trees aren't dragons
i don't see the problem there
it's getting attacked in like
we'll get money from defending the town next session
it's a little gay
i don't see anything wrong with that
Dragon&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;staff
cause you're not thinking of even distribution of cool shit
that's why he'll want your dragon
but if you concede the ship to him he won't care about having a piece of your dragon
tbh i honestly don't think the team even cares too much about the dragons
doesn't it?
we'll have 2 lightning dragons tho
i'm sitting with 6k and nothing to spend it on
nobody's asked me to do that yet.
if team needs something i'll buy it for em
cause he knows i'm gonna be a piece of shit about it
he's joking
tbh that'll be super helpful
we're gettin there
I'll fuck you up
well that's too bad
yea sure
except we decided to go south
sure
lmao
very forced
parsa’s felt
i’ll do it whenever it happens
and didn't do anything to fuck that up
that the original didn't
no it wasn't
you shouldn't bait like that in a fucking movie
it's so fucking simplistic
ofc she wasn't because she's the hero
what's unforgivable is that rey didn't join him

not doing that
phone would be cancer
procreate is for tablet’s right?
being able to have my hand on the lines im making is a huge help for me at least
probably cause i dont have a pen and shit
i just can’t ever get something to look how i want it to in it
also i know how to use photoshop
procreate is only for windows right?
and it was a huge pain in the ass
last time i pirated photoshop i got a virus
im not risking that shit
otherwise i’d sketch on paper then do the linework on a computer
i dont have any good free software for coloring
maybe
yea thats why i dont color my shit
pastels are the tools of the devil
and fuck pastels

parsa would
im not rolling pally lol

none of our characters are built to be literal dickholes
its just that it probably wont get any use
i mean im not saying we shouldnt do it
barsa might
i doubt it
naw
actually we did session one
but we havent murdered anyone
thats what i meant
lay on hands
right
i just don't know why we'd do this
it's strong
we're both lawful evil
they'd probably go after me or parsa before jett
that isn't a drow?
VERY true
if only
lol
i want to tho
no
shit’s a headache
i hate malls
yea ik
christmas shopping
im currently at a mall
i cant team btw
wassup
either that or searching for a long lost sibling
i havent thought too much about it
probably something having to do with delving deep underground to find the perfect diamond or ruby or something
samuel is a simple man
and maybe to have a couple friends
"to wake up in the morning and shit into my golden toilet, wash my hands in a crystal bowl and eat freshly carved roasted pork, adorned with gold shavings."
samuel wants
i quoted to milo
that shit’s stupid
feels so bad
kms
they literally did this this morning
they swapped my schedule so instead of working 12-6 im now working 6-12
nevermind. looks like i wont be able to make it
a   h o t   m i n u t e
cause i need to change out of my stupid work uniform and head over. and depending on the traffic that could take
maybe 8
like after 7

o
milo’s mayor rohit could get struck by lightning and laugh it off
as long as that does something thats fine
lmfao
we can't go to the desert and find some sand nigger named rohit that says "vro, i hate" ?
we can't go to the desert and find some sand nigger name rohit that says "vro, i hate" ?
who has "all the things" and "all the coolest cars"
i don't mind him being a character
and instead being an inside joke meme
its like a dmpc without the slutty edgy vampire vibe
rohit is pretty cancer
and actually start this weekend or something
and have it be a test session
we could also just retcon all of that shit
i mean
sure
a proper introductory session though, cause like we literally didnt meet and arent connected at all through backstory
we need like
i scam helpless villagers with magic
i dont kill people tho
true
yea
idk how unka unk will end up
so it was pretty alright in that regard
but like he wasnt too crazy about it
jett memed, and parsa murderhoboed a bit
yea see
keyleth is really good at rolling with low performance rolls too
milo's got the potential i think, if he just got a little more into it
i mean im p sure that was his first time dming
they metagame hard sometimes, but aside from that it's fuckin awesome
starting critical role from the beginning cause i don't remember where i was
they're all professional voice actors
toughguy69
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
NOOOO
another 15 or so minutes
not yet
after i walk my dogs maybe
that game looks like a milo game
wtf
its fuckin janna
i just checked surrender at 20
dont fuck up tattoos
not worth
Oh and its more expensive
so like
covering up a tattoo with another hurts 3x as much
or any one of those shitty tattoo cover up shows
i guess
protips from my dad
dont just get a spur of the moment tattoo
you should think about it for a while though
eventually
getting the whole hieroglyph thing with the scarab holding the sun
so fuck you
but im getting a scarab beetle
i would say get a scarab beetle
are not that good
the other ones
or a chinese character if you have to
get a jelly fish
am i too late?
weed may just turn into the new standard currency
since there's no government to tell you not to
everyone?
so
i imagine it'd be a pretty fucking lucrative business
so when the great wasteland is all that's left we can still synthesize seratonin with them bitches
i bet them magic shrooms would survive ww3 regardless
well
i only joke
(puke)
ugh blegh environmentalist
a
also a blegh
wait miles is a fuckin leftist mind samurai academic
x fucking d
so far
ur just the most libertarian
by a decent margin
miles is lefter than you
actually
im pretty sure that was bound to happen
but in here it's purple
yellow and purple are usually bottom right in the memes
i bet money parsa is purple/yellow
gang gang
i'll go first
take it so we can meme each other
hey i found a fuckin chart
fuckin kojima
lets see which of yall niggas is real niggas
if bloodsouls comes to pc i'd probably try and finish it
warlock gang rise up
yeah but your mind is being used as a medium for extra-dimensional demigods so you don't really need to do shit at that point
i have yet to see a convincing argument
why not dissociate from reality completely and give your mind to the endless void
and this is dumb, but why close your third eye?
but
oh god
shlept'nt
awake af
im woke
yeah i just chugged tea and a redbull
nearly hour 30
at least when 4kids wasn't in charge.... then it wasn't all that metal
at least when 4kids wasn't in charge.... then it wasn't all that metal
yugioh was pretty metal
and maybe growing some head spikes
mans should consider putting his teeth on the outside of his mouth
yeah
it's like the opposite of a gargantuan elephant man
no traps, tiny head massive shoulders
for me
the problem is the shoulders
tiny head massive body is disgusting is the problem
a question?
is this even like
crimson chad
reality is starting to get a little wobbly
i’ve been awake for 28 hours

felt cool as hell to have set up a server once you actually finished
idk
oh man
that was it
yeah hamachi
but fuck third parties and their third party interests amirite?
you gotta configure ips and do some dchp nonsense that i forgot how to do
and hopefully some pretty decent internet
which is why you need a stronger computer
but if you don't want to use external services you enable port forwarding on your router and basically host a lan party from your own computer
oh for realms? yeh
no
my laptop caint run that shit no way
2d gay
fuck terraria
x fucking d
oh

my hamster wheel comp will run that shit just fine
idgaf bout no rtx
lmao barely
i want to get those optifine shaders and shit to work if im gonna play minecraft though
almost seems like the rona was a ploy by sanders supporters to make all of his socialist dreams become a reality
what a dilemma
wow
less mouthbreathing banjo strumming sisterfuckers might be just what we need.
they are keeping themselves out of the greater gene pool
i mean
lul
nope.
huh.
really?
oh you're talking about patrons
the bigguns as bartenders?
don't gay bars usually have like
wow
xd
japanese box art
without getting all gay about it or anything
yes. only a true thad can appreciate another man's cock for the beauty and simplicity of its form.
that's where you're wrong
ngl that shits funny as fuck
(puke)
which was kinda gay, owl is the most fun boss fight in that game
i guess
but
i didn't think it was all that close
i saw the sword saint isshin one
i want more crashing nazi cargo planes into homoerotic vampires
people are wrong
joseph is by far the best

this is terrible
fucking lol

the holy blade start's pretty dank ngl
i see
in kenshi
wait, where are you setting yourself up, miles
did you drop to the ground?
lmfao
lul
i’d argue to swap lawful good and chaotic neutral, but thats just because i dont wanna be a faggit in comparison to that gigachad up there
i mean
couldn’t go unsaid
is high tier
this
thats gold
s h a m e    r e a p e r
can i be a super saiyan?
homebrew races?
i got called by my mom and somehow i called the group chat trying to answer. Sorry.
.
thats p impressive
i mean
you gave yourself a brain tumor for $8?
are you the asshole who ties it twice?
but that shit disappears fast
though, if i haven't lost it yet i'll usually just reuse the bag clip
the twist and tuck has always been the right move
lawful goods
100% correct
that shit checks out
you know what
oof
that shit was huge
anyone else just get rocked by that earthquake?
sick air
good move though
yikes
you could hear the crack of that mans neck
ever made
the last level is the best shit
don't look up any spoilers
best game ever made
get ape out
i forgot devolver sale was a thing
oh fuck
which i think is my main grievance with the whole thing. he didn't have to flip over the piece of rotten meat. he just did it cause he's an asshole.
i feel like that would have pushed it from the "why the fuck are you making this video" territory, to the "oh shit i know exactly why the fuck you made this video." territory
ech the last like 10 seconds pushed me past that line
ech
so now you get it too
for some reason youtube put this shit in my face
enjoy! :)
im sending this video because i want to spoon my eyes out and eat them
im not sending this video to you all because i like you
im gonna say it's cosmic recompense for running a shitty dnd campaign to stave off the rona boredom for the boys
you know what you have to do milo
if they go ahead with the 2k per month thing imma buy a new pc, fuck it
fucking lul
i got my govt stimulus check so now im officially a neet
best this city’s ever looked
blade runner is better cyberpunk

aom
lies
they fucked themselves forever
they fucked themselves forever
uh excuse me retard thats exactly what i said
WB claimed it
WB claimed it
so buggs bunny being a struggling rapist is officially canon
oh yeah
oh my god they blew it all to hell
all i can say goodnight fellas
beep is the strongest warrior
oh my god

new fiddle is pog as fuck
to get a game on the pbe
its so hard
sure
quack game?
at least i didn't int
LOL
cause some asshole in my house pissed in our router's electrical socket?
is that why it was the worst?
i dc'd last night and just didn't come back
a new banger
dunkey’s done it again
just put it in a notification straight on their smartphone or smart watch or stupid fkn google glasses
LOL
fucking 
Eric Me
lmao
ok
major faggot energy 
biden is the opposite of obama
lmao
will you join me in my 2020 crusade? all women must die
but i suppose i was wrong
i tried to see better of them
they lie to guys but not to each other
false but true
true
but if my girl lie to me over stupid shit she won’t stay 
i mean for safety you can always opt to get a daddy
but esteem needs are right
all of these
i mean theres more you can do for like
riot just wants an excuse to get more money
its like apex legends stat trackers except those are free
whats the difference between the rp eternals and all the non rp ones?
literally nothing
ah no, 3%
12%
which in the grand scheme of things is like
rn bernie’s only down by 65
idk
cause riot knew everyone knew they were bs
noooooo
you bought them?
and its also not like all the bernie retards would take trump over a democrat
i mean its not like biden has won
It'd take a lot of careful paperwork to try and make that shit stand in courts. But it'd be worth. 
oh, free.
so we just analyze the data and sell that shit?
The problem is that regardless of if it's 50 or 500 influenceable people, you'll end up with scenarios like boomerberg's dumbass ad campaign. Everyone will see it and start to realize that they don't actually enjoy having shit shoved into their faces. And targeting the most easily influenced people just makes that even more apparent to anyone with the brainpower to recognize that they're being targeted with ads.
But uh, what exactly does genetic diversity have to do with network-based advertising? I mean large numbers shouldn't be a problem for an AI with the right amount of processing power so it isn't a stretch to search for the 500 closest people and go from there.
no u
40k is stupid.
:)
that mans holds the key to my heart and my chastity belt
uti is the exception to this rule
i don't like adventure time
also i'm impossible to influence
so why not?
that said i don't use social media
i am vehemently against this
cause he’s got big dick energy
cause he’s cooler than they are
bernie’s boomer colleagues hat him
so vote bernard for the lulz
truee
alexa hit that x files theme
what the fuuuuuuuuck.
yeah wtf
oh
ok league broke my mental
aight
get to bed dawg
oh

so they greedy ass niggas?
what bad thing happened on a private island that made you realize that?
oh god
Yes.
Yes.
question mark.
i wrote that as a sentence but meant it as a question.
anyone wanna play duck game.
ok im done doing stupid bullshit for the day
Miss the old days when there was always a guy from this group who initiated group calls randomly.
[B]eague

eggcellent
which means that if you move to iceland they’ll all fuck you to expand the gene pool
fucking hilarious
is
this
holy shit
companies should be paying him to review their games
and bar chicks kinda suck
look if height is the deciding factor in the appearance of dominance in a relationship you're doing it way wrong
this is why being 6'5 is  lame
arright
hop on discord
i'll type at eric
tru
xd
i writer let me write
typing is gooder
?
fuck
?
we're not normal either
you're not normal
eric you're talking to us bozos arent you?
learning to be yourself is less important than learning to use yourself imo
discontent creates change
discontent is good
im down as well sounds dank
it's ego stop living so selfishly and commit your body and soul to the human hivemind
i know the fuckin feel
for a job that you're not even sure you want for that matter
it's just one that is suffused with people
well comedy is a main gig
comedy is not
sponsoring is a main gig
you die
if you want to be an actress in hollywood and you move to hollywood from delaware with no plans in place?
entertainment is where shitty unfounded dreams go to die
that's not true
entertainment and service industry
thats really it
entertainment
idk
even if that means moving to a college dorm
firstly, move out.
then change it in whatever way possible
are you fulfilled with your current lifestyle?
well thats kinda dumb
quit league
you don't want a job that drains your balls
milo stem, medicine and law will drain you and your balls
maybe youtube
not tv, podcasts or smth
100k or bust
oh that's doggie dog for the work you'd be putting in.
system automation probably pays way more.
aerospace or weapons tech?
what kind of rocket?
yes.
^
you should be a talkshow host milo
gay
gay
gay
anarchy isn't innately edgy or anything
im just a true anarchist
im not edgy
pffft
you still are the edgiest one
ez money
microdose to cure ur depression
not wrong
eh
i meet bar chicks
i don't go to class.
never
yeah
and then i never get in contact with them again.
the only stands i have last one night
me?
you think I'm gonna do some shit for v day?
fuck no
valentines day is a bitch day.
yeah
then cook her food
ok then do it
can you afford to take her out for $1500 steak just for valentines day?
that was her mom playing your dad.
except that wasn't her mom playing you
you already got played
best advise you'll ever get.
ask her what she wants and then do that.
nobody here has valentines day ideas
no
TRU
don't marry her if she doesn't want a prenup
"no, i only married you for the greencard"
you're the one living in america
you can hold it over her
no
that's gay
you want her to have to be in heels and stand on her toes if she wants to kiss you?
why do you not want your girl to be as tall as you in heels?
xd
type y for no and n for yes
should we send help?
is she reading over your shoulder?
are you describing your girlfriend?
live a better life
decrease your size to 6'4
take the hormones
you gotta do it
milo
more asians for me
look at projared
you'll just come back even better than ever
cause even those girls can't hurt you over unfounded lies
it can happen to anyone but unless you actually raped some girl, then it will blow over
unless you need to tell us something, eric
also you can't get metoo'd if you're not a pedophile rapist so you're already safe
you're safe
yeah that metoo shit dont exist there
the ones from germany are just dommes
but not the ones from germany
they do
they're naturally taller
go for german chicks milo
l u l
if you tried to date sarah, milo, diego would beat the shit outta you
cause diego is chad af
nah
xd
*sarah
you should date sara
and she talked to us and it was chill
diego fell asleep
and after they got there
i only saw it at your birthday eric
?
yeah ur gonna be waiting my guy
and if she leaves then you just get a new one
she's compelled to stay with you because the government said so
just slap her if she's a bitch
mandated
you're in favor of government madated gf?
so
what if they're greekgodx
what if they're an ugly piece of shit?
is that too much to ask?
I want 1 dollar a year from every person in the world
if anything the more shitbrained people there are, the more people you have to sell shit to
why the fuck do you care about the gene ratio of the world?
gay dudes have the issues
gay women can reproduce just fine
did you not hear me say that i barely want kids? why the fuck would i want grandkids?
and 2 cause then i don't have to worry about her getting fucked by dudes
1 cause lesbians are hot and my family better pull bitches
i want my daughter to be gay
i'll be the resident nigga
fuck new zealand move me to iceland
very little issues when it comes to poverty
they have no population issues
their energy is almost entirely clean
with more than that
so i guess im not having an autistic kid regardless, problem solved.
i didn't even know that was a thing
but thats just cause i don't want my kids to have to live with being autistic and the stigmas that surround that
it's about the kids, personally i'd still let iceland test my unborn kid for the tism and let them abort it
well its not about you
when it comes to kids
some people shouldn't have to deal with their lots in life
abortions are good
what the fuck is wrong with my life
then you're like
a catastrophe is when you have 2 kids, 1 an autistic paraplegic son, and 1 a thot skank daughter and you find out that she uses the son to emotionally bait people into spending money on her
but i'd hesitate to call that a catastrophe
yeah
that's blowing it up a bit
was autistic i'd probably have another kid
but if my first kid
regardless
i only want 1 kid if any
im asking gwyn
if your first kid was autistic and you could support a second kid would you stop having kids?
most people do
yeah you should be a dad
these are objectively true facts
people are no longer allowed to change in the age of social media
you say the wrong shit once and it lasts forever that's how this shit works
nah
eric you shouldn't be a father ngl
do we blame them? yesss
black dads fail all the time
failing as a parent is ghosting your kids
you're failing at failing well
so you've already mislabeled it
but if you learned something you didn't fail
failing is only good if you learn from it
to answer your question milo
well failing is wrong cause it's beta.
for the "greater good"
than i would work my ass off
i'd rather teach my kids how to kill a rapist with nothing more than a ballpoint pen
and if you think there is you're a cuuuuck
there's nothing wrong with being selfish
smoke a couple bowls and grind out a few children seems like the optimal way to live life
IS there more to life than grinding?
hol up
low level managers are bad bosses
well no shit
that's good
you're his fucking cousin
to deal with those people regardless
you gotta be strung pretty high in order to keep pushing yourself like that
i think those two kinda do go hand in hand
uhhh
?
so why does that same line of reasoning not apply to yourself
if others tell you someone else is cool do you believe them?
exactly
for the most part
cool is a facade
most cool people aren't that cool
and also cold blooded
they got to that spot by being smart
producers just say yes or no for a living
that's literally all they do
studio execs just sign checks for a living
league sucks
are they not working for a living?
im talking strictly in terms of how filled their pockets are
but im not saying they're unlikeable
*few
a fe
the ones with a shitton of money are the studio execs and the producers
professional actors are like mid tier at best
in the movie industry?
yeah i know
the higher you go the larger the egos
that's not the people at the top
me?
so remove government ez clap
the majority of the reason for killing is government and government created institutions and ideologies
except nobody's gonna do that without reason anyway
so that you can be sure that people aren't running around killing each other
government is control
government isn't enjoyable
why play games?
well nah
yeah
flip the table play a different game
omegachads own and create companies
rat fuckers manage companies
rat fuckers don't run companies
it's incredibly appealing
and good wifi
no i'll just live on a hill with good lines of sight.
kill them.
that's simple
well
and your name
technically the government owns your body
i can literally be paid for existing by people without that lil rat that's fuckin tryna bite off a piece of my hand cause i was born in the area they said was theirs.
and not get taxed on it
except without government i can charge whatever i want for my own ip and merch
^^^^
i mean that seems optimal as fuck
any time is a good time, just like no government is good government
that's the best play
i want to nuke the white house and move to new zealand
i don't specifically want to tilt you, but tilting you appears to be an added bonus to running my fucking mouth, so i'm reveling in it.
but you gotta have backup plans
i'd of course elect bernie
you don't want to kill a bunch of rich people and loot their stuff like it's fuckin fallout new vegas?
cause it'd be fun
sure but if trump gets re-elected we all arm ourselves and storm the upper class
lul
well if you haven't gone to court and gotten fucked in the ass yet by trump's judges so far it probably won't happen while he's still president
on the reg
except miss sanders
it'd still be rough
but yeah
milo could live in a much nicer place if he wasn't in santa monica tbh
same
and you're not
because you're on the cusp of being half decent
the middle class is by far the worst class on that we can agree
she also looks like a frog and that's why she called pepe a hate symbol
still is
also we didn't win california cause the feminists were literally exploding out their vaginas for hillary. but that shit's calmed down these days
pete's a faggit and everyone knows
naw dude california is bernie all the way
if ur getting influenced then ur a lil bitch
and your opinion doesn't matter
and we can't affect the iowa census
unless bernie pussies out like he did in 2016
the fact of the matter is we don't live in a state where shit like iowa's census affects us in the slightest
but i voted for bernie in 2016 cause hillary was gonna win in ca regardless and she can't have my support
i don't know who lily graham is
oh
you think your dad is gonna vote for clinton?
well in the direction they want to influence you
then it doesn't actually influence you
so?
ew
does media influence your decision?
also they're wrong a majority of the time
media gay
they're voting trump anyway.
who cares?
with the whole iowa thing
yo so
fucking lol
lul
for the meme
nvm you should do it
oh holy balls
nigga can wait on his ciggies.
no
and maybe just type something stupid simple like read [char]
also very high iq video right there good shit
but i think the correct answer there is to use your fuckin eyes
yeah that don’t make sense if you don’t study fucking coding
i mean
hahaha
wow shit F
oh
"i don't know the word (button)" ~milo
needs more scruff
he's got a gayboy face
and still is
but their fuckin pr team is weeblord central
riot's studios are probably bro culture
alright
league is definitely being overrun by the weebs
league is not bro culture
so i could see it
idk most game devs are pretty pc
muted
part two is the best one
what?
fucking retarded and hilarious 
wow thats
discord?
im tilted
if they give an answer that isn't "Idk, i don't really watch basketball" then they're automatically bullshit
that's retarded
who the fuck would pick lebron over jordan?
i don't want to buy overcooked.
you know a nigga named paris?
you know a nigga named paris?
its the same shit
mandatory rehabilitation=jail
it is true
still bernie&gt;biden
*rn
biden's rly not doing his best nr
tarkov looks not bad
f for two worlds
rip
just to run around and be the biggest fucking douchenose ever
it's kinda worth on that alone
at least what i heard of it
the dialogue is kind of incredible
yeah
whats you consensus on the game now, then?
and soaking it in boiling water and drinking it was the best thing before crushing it and snorting it.
cause those peeps in africa and south america wanted to try anything they could to get high
nah man, lets be real, her feelings are #2, and your feelings are number 1
lets play some games
food achieved
aight
so im prob gonna do that first
i was gonna make some food
maybe with some more bools
game?
duck
suh
i'd have gone back for my mans
fuck
uti was playin league?
wait wat
it's not about handling it it's about enjoying it.
objectively
well actually yeah
i said the gamer word and then it was referenced like once or twice
no
i skipped to the bottom and decided eric was wrong on a whim
i didn't read it all
how was your day.
sup jett
no you're edgy
being sober in general is inadvisable
which is inadvisable
unless you're fucking sober
no you don't
randomly eat her out and don't ask for anything in return once in a blue moon
and never budge
and then HOLD that shit over her for the rest of her damn life
anyway if you want your girlfriend to stop giving you shit
that probably contributes heavily
also it helped that i was blasted and had no idea which direction was up
exactly
nobody 22 compares
best head i ever got came from a bitch who was at least 29-30
and then theres shit i don't want
like theres head that's really good
YES
or i like the really unpracticed nerdy ones
i guess i've been unlucky
nobody knows how
getting head sucks
i eat it.
so
pussy tastes good.
again
sometimes it's a slightly off smelling puss, sometimes its a goddam hair caught in your teeth
i mean theres shit you deal with
but pussy is preferable
i mean variety is the spice o life
well
i guess
well
nope
definitely not.
hard disagree
never the other way around
i've heard of people thinking they did and then not liking the real thing though, milo.
i think it's just a do or dont
i don't think so
that shits nasty
there are people out there not in cells that like shit play
i mean
7bil people on the planet ofc there is some depraved piece of shit like that out there
there's definitely someone out there that would jizzle in there pants after getting suckerpunched in an alleyway
in the moment
yep
yes
it's just fucked up
there is
then it's just assault
the kink isn't a kink unless they're jumping you sexually
i mean
LOL
that's bad.
it's a kink. don't kinkshame, milo.
adrenaline is a hell of a drug man
"fight"
i've already bet like 20 bucks on this fight
are you though?
i see it happening
ez
i'll find a hoe that doesn't want that
hard agree
heres the thing i don't want to defeat a hoe
xd
LOL
it's not about being right.
ez glap
i grew up with a single black mom. who was pretty attractive. whenever she was stressed out she had like 6 dudes on call.
make the dick good enough to satisfy the body, mind and soul.
its not even hard
yeah
if she's complaining about some shit she probably just wants more dick
parents aren't always unconditional
that's not necessarily true
you can't teach chillness
motivate and stress her out
yeah
well
that stress probably comes from familial pressure, yeah
things jut happen regardless
no
without solid proof or enabling drugs
but you can't really convince her of that rn
i agree with you there
yeah
well
what does she stress and worry about?
so
and u know it
my dumbass scribblio is the best
in a non-joking manner
just stop calling people niggers
nobody wants to take away your happiness or change your life plan
on a basic level
but the fact that eric is probably the happiest and most satisfied person in the groupchat and still has the worst opinion of people and the world in general. that makes his worldview the bleakest.
it affects it
yeah
no
self-importance isn't a worldview
exactly
that has nothing to do with a worldview
not even
eric yours is bleaker
same
what's the difference between making a suicide pact with a normal ass nigga and a suicide pact with a tranny?
yes
next time milo plays league everyone in the world dies
we should make a suicide pact
HAHA
it's already established that he doesn't want to change his mind
ok why are you arguing with eric about this?
it is muted
holy shit you guys are systematically killing my skype
perfectly depicts what sakurai thinks of us
this is an amazing image
wow
byleth in smash kill my whole self.
fuckin autists and their abject selfishness
what are/were you cooking?
i’ll do the right thing and call the jihad upon thee. for allah
your poor tainted soul
league is the devil
no league
dude don't talk good about china
fucking lmao
lul
ye
And yeah experiences and connection like that. Without extraneous bullshit is worthwhile.
for me im just trying to find reasons to not kill myself.
for them its like recovering from years of repressed anxiety and depression 
and it was me and a bunch of people like 30 years old and up drinking this tea to try and heal old wounds and shit
like my mom had me go to this group thing, and that was where i was last night
so you can like honest and open with yourself and the people around you
well the physical part is like kinda okay but you do it to remove those layers and walls of built up crap from your psyche
yeah
and nah at melting away more like just vibrating all over and feeling like getting pushed into the ground.
ayahuasca is shitty unprocessed dmt. @eric
had to shut off my phone like 15 mins after typing that shit
that shits hilarious 
also lmao at irl streams
Ayahuasca trip Mars. Open forum. AmA
he’s back
alright 
d a m n
wow banger of a meme
lego city
Yeah next patch she's getting buffed
i get what you were asking now.
ahhh
in the back
except that one motherfucker
like the model was copy pasted several times over
THATS him
n he's in the back fuckin wildin like an animal
see how all of the guys are standing all neat and orderly
oh fuck i found him
that motherfucker is the real hero of this video
that's some sick shit
i will say, those fuckin demacia battle lines with galio behind them
and once he realizes that he's gonna puke
it totally does
no
its that they were super far apart and she looked like an alien
yeah it wasn't that they were too big
oh wait nevermind
they were tiny
no
she needed bigger eyes
idk they kinda fucked up her face in the last video
irelia is the thicc bih
it's working
fuck you
you're literally saying that to upset me
kaisa do be thicc tho
that was cool
and urgod
at least cait and vi got some love
i don't wanna see lux
league videos are filled with lux
fuuck
bruh hit me
fuck you have auto response?
worlds going nuts
yo
wtf
hahaha
yo that's def 6 fingers
bruh am i retarded or does bronson have six fingers on those paws
cause fuck fantano for making the easily impressed normies like my ascendant patrician music
that death grip meme makes me upset
maybe not launch missiles at every third jet that passes over their country
but they gotta slow down
i mean i feel bad for them
iran is getting kinda retarded
but it’s scuffed as fuck
web browser instagram is there
not really
lmao
gj
well then totally dodged
xd
that said you could be drafted as a pilot or a mechanic or something
you're unfit for service
exactly
the army doesn't want depressed people cause having someone who actively wants to die is a massive liability on the battlefield, both to themselves and their companions
but you can always go to your psychiatrist and tell them you wanna kill yourself for that free as fuck clinical depression diagnosis
degeneracy doesn't protect anyone, sadly
he's aspie so he's safe
xd
he's aspie so he's safe
*true
that's trough we do have way better computational power all across the board
my gait changes depending on the neighborhood im walking in.
if you're not retarded it's pretty simple to dodge that shit
but like
that is pretty cool
yeah
me? leave the room? xd
same
that's the morally right thing to do
and helping them kill the fat bastard
tbh we should be siding with iran
exactly
they have said that they literally only have beef with trump and not with the us
they only hate trump
iran literally doesn't want to start a war with the us
haha you wish
and
im to fucked up in the head to raise a child
cause i aint having kids
^ yeah that's why it's cool to litter
x fucking d
eric tries to become a military contractor to design genocidal ai, while we band together to take him down in the finale
like it was some sorta stupid story arc
see i thought you were talking specifically to eric in reference to this specific friend group
...
we as in humans or we as in us?
wait wat milo?
and it's probably not happening
war is war
war isn't genocide
on top of it
and plug that shit in
get a mechanical keyboard
bruh just
no
fuckin copy pasting penis
literally the reason you need p key on your keyboard
and to argue it you have to moralize it
i mean you can't get it if you can't argue it
eric you're retarded, you can't moralize genocide with the randomness argument
jfc man
p is even worse
milo u gotta fix your keys
operating without a y is fuckin rough
what you want is easy as fuck
dude just plug yourself into vr and never come back out
ew is this some evangelion shit?
xd
my god form has six arms and all of them would fuck you up
if everyone's perfect then how the fuck are you gonna be better than everyone else?
eric that's gay
nah that shit's fine i don't wanna hurt nobody
except i'd grow like 6 arms
ez new body
i'd fuckin do it
@gwin
but that idea does.
not many things scare me
gwyn with a gat
aight niggas im outta work
oh, well that old trailer, yeah. But that was pre-alpha 
maybe but i haven’t seen it
idk haven’t seen any actual gameplay
ghost of tsushima?
also you can’t even enlist if you’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression. I fuckin tried
you don’t need to apply for federal student aid to go to community college, you also do not need to sign for selective service.
which admittedly is not often
i break like 5 laws every time i walk out of the house
cant draft me for selective service if i never took your tainted fake government money
200 iq plays
cause i never did that fafsa shit and didnt go 
tbh all of yall are gonna be drafted except me
i'd meet you guys but it takes a fucking hour to get there and back
india superpower 2020
like getting laid off from our jobs and evicted from our apartments. real nigga shit

did i wake up in some alt reality where niggas dont get shot for bringing borderline ieds onto planes and LA air isnt practically solid with car exhaust?
like
ay does anybody know wtf is going on with the assload of snow on the mountains that seems to be going on? and why the sky seems to be clear as fuck and not hazy/smoggy at all?

i saw a trailer for the amazon game
yeah same
which theater?
tuesday?
come on niggas, you know what time it is
very op
you build a fuckin titano hydra and then there's little to no difference between how you play the two
he's exactly like vi except with more burst and less mobility
sett ult is just vi ult
and naw man
w is broken
like a more fun vi
sett feels good as fuck to play
ngl
wtf is this?
lmao
join, fuck bitch
skribblio
time to DRAW?
theres a proven 2:1 ratio between gf blowjobs and dinners cooked
actually eric just learn anyway
otherwise learn to cook
if you’re just trying to save money and not starve then it’s rly not that hard
being healthy isn’t cheap
well then yeah
pisses me off
actually 
this shit
yeag dude
what the fuck
guys
lets go
you never play skribbl.io
alright fuckers skribbl time
my dad introduced me to the exec VP of Katz network and the guy offered me a job in philly
but we were all wasted and i think he and my dad had done several lines worth of coke by that point
will keep you posted
i've gotta follow up
so i have no fuckin clue
we were all fuckin wasted
again
idk what the fuck happened last night but i think i got fired and im moving to atlanta to work on tv shows
man
never gets unhype
watching people go through the path of pain
but this video makes me happy
not sure why
(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)
that fuckin link
(puke)
(puke)
i lost hour 0
me? fuck no
we all know you destroy pussy on the reg and theres no way nnn would put a stop to that.
either
i don’t believe that
do not believe you
i
nobody 
fr
like
who actually won nnn?
if we were drunk and at mcdonalds i’d order for myself no matter how faded, tyvm
im en route to cava, then
thanks brothers
thatd be hella dope
if my nigmas would be so kind as to put the place in chat
i defer my restaurant vote to group, meet you there
change might to will
except more cause i don’t want to fucking uber to sm and the train is right by my place
same
also 12 on the promenade

i'll have pleeeeeenty of time to talk shit
no work tomorrow, just gotta ride the check collecting merry-go-round.
then im gonna make fun of you
if yall decide to be white women and get brunch
js
dam im gonna be busy
in most cases
i think a human with a gun beats it
and kill him with the plunging attack
it'd probably just drop on the motherfucker from a tree
but yeah
*sweat
it'd break a swea
a tiger could do it
tigers are rogueish
they're pack hunters
lions aint that rogueish
well
pfft
it's just that instead of it happening in 2 seconds it happens in .2 seconds
not that that wasn't always the case
if malph or bard lands a 4-5 man ult you basically instantly win
flamethrower ult just instantly bursts their entire team if they're clumped up tightly
flamethrower ult just instantly bursts their entire team if they're clumped up tightly
or scythe chakaram, you use scythe q to fully stack the passive then swap over to just delete everyone
like chakaram+rifle you just set down a chakaram q and go ham
and then also understanding that the chakaram when paired with a good weapon is fucking op
the only moderately hard part of the fkn champ is getting used to the missle speed on the different guns
so if you fuck up you're actually retarded
but honestly there's like 7 different on screen trackers for your ammo
and if you have enough of a brain to keep track of your guns
if he gets ahead
but he's only fun cause he's fucking ridiculously broken
nah he's still fun
you probably won't get there till like 5-6 am, huh?
how long is the greyhound to SM?
really really fuckin easy
in unrelated news, aphelios is
too bad
damb
duck game?
i got home at a reasonable hour
wow
and it’ll probably be the same again tonight 
no skribbling for me
i didn’t get home until like 1
i missed skribble
damb
wow
but i do want to play it
fuckin weird ass kit
huh
does he just get static level ups or something?
fuckin meme
e doesn't exist
only has 3 buttons
it actually looks pretty coo
riot has been huffing gas
guys
ay happy birthday david
ok
does it take place in disney russia or what?
that shit was gay
noooooope
^
so valve is killing no memes today
but it's also not half life 3
i'd be very excited about that game if i had any sort of vr shit or the space to use it or a computer that could possibly run that without exploding
jfc
if i can find a good torrent i’ll send
cause its so much better to go in blind
i don’t rly wanna say much
new
korean movie
its a movie
you guys should check it out if you find the time 
parasite is a very very good movie
thats kinda sick
he wears a boar on his head i think its safe to assume the latter
and yeah
also its 3 houses
lmk if he’s worth it in your opinion 
i’ve heard the 3rd mc is better
death stranding cured my doomerism
only monster
fucking hate that guy
much like mgs tbh
also i think it's more fun to experience the plot by watching or playing the actual game, since the way they execute it definitely outshines what it actually is
really can't take it seriously
i like the game as one big meme
but it's got some fantastic setpieces
kinda retarded
idk man the plot is kinda fuckin nuts
lmao you did?
u right
gatorade woulda gone out of business in that world
you know, fair
...
i still dont know why they made up their own energy drink for that movie instead of using gatorade
wtf is brawndo
huh?
the meme?
huh?
there is no water in kojima’s idealized america 
a lot of monster energy 
with monster energy
then i quit it
until the orange guy showed up
of all japanimations out there demon slayer isn’t bad
lmao
is retarded
that
nothing ever changes
ninjas have always been the oppressed minority
nah b it's just a well timed luigi down taunt
rly can’t beat that shit
and you can lay down as many of them as you want
cause it has deployable ziplines
and its better than fuckin everything out there
yeah
death stranding is game of the year fuck everything else
alright
^ fr
that's hilarious
holy shitting fuck
my booma
also milo your new picture is not best girl and i'm severely disappointed
that game... yikes is an understatement
8, yessss?
camping at 8 yes?
this game is retarded
just gonna point this out
well is it true?
but most of them lie
i imagine most dentists are like this
nice meme
but i was proven wrong
i was expecting this to not be funny
holy shit
this is fucking gold
that’s an abomination . why?
is that a sink/water fountain hybrid?
doesn’t matter so long as they’re delivered
but you can choose the lashing implement
i was just posting this to fuck with eric
so no you’re out. 20 lashes upon thee, bitch
also gwyn i asked the question and you answered that we would
horus heresy is really hard to get into for me man
i bought the book but haven’t finished it
are we gonna count nutting under the influence as a true nut for the purposes of nnn?
yea
highly accurate
yes
because it's a fucking dumbass meme and we're fucking dumbasses
doing what?
i’ll trade you
jett your bed is quite comfortable 
well second bed turned couch
on milo’s couch
but when i get home i’ll be extra down
i have not been home since i left for your place last night, eric
if you want them, make them up
idfc about punsishments
twenty lashings
lmfao
you make up the punishments
are these fair prizes for NNN?
for parsa this means food of some sort, i guess.
and maybe everyone in chat has to buy you a shot of your choosing once
if you win you get hard r privileges for a year
That’s nutty
wow blizzard decided to not shit the bed?
i mean if you wanna play no nut nobember on hard mode go for it
yes
i think it’s important to note that in light of making NNN more gender accessible and progressive and shit that all orgasms of any kind shall, for the month of november be considered nutting
but im assuming its real
also i just made all that shit up
all that shits off limits while you’re still in the running
or the no nutt nutt loophole
or the handless nutt loophole
that means you can’t use the fist yourself to completion loophole
and nobody can do it
i only assume because it’s funnier that way
oh
if u nut u lose. what are we betting this time?
it has begun
i no longer have a desire to engage in philosophical discussions with the peanut gallery so now I can appreciate that meme and call you guys nerds at the same time
hah
nerds
no
sleep’nt
stinky
ew
grab on y
ew wot
but i cannot stand not having a z
i mean you had enough buttons to dedicate one action to everything 
rly?
not massively different but different 
smash 3ds is a different game from smash 4 tho
nah fam you just sent the fabled jewu
unless that handheld thing is a switch
console games should never be adapted to handheld
its rly weird to send an uwu when blasting gojira
uwu
huh, cool
gwyn i never asked, do your parents know?
its actually massive gay
yes
uwu
pissing on people’s cars was a bit mote fun
so far i feel no discernible difference 
this time im trying an altruistic walk home, so i bought a pack of oreos and im handing them out to anyone i pass on the street
lmao

i see nothing wrong
All the best parts of an entire pack of oreos in one cookie
Superiority
restraint and dedication 
the missing link
holy fuckin shit
transformers gave me early onset diabetes 
l m fucking a o
truly the guiding light of this group of retards
you’re the alpha among alpha males
thank you david
i haven’t actually gotten to say that piece yet in one of these philosophical arguments. so now that i have i don’t need to take part in any more if these. thank fuck
fuck all the dumb shit
so what i’m getting at here is i hope all yall degen niggas live thoroughly satisfying lives that you can look back at and think “yeah i regret none of that.”
i think you just gotta do whatever makes you the most satisfied and then do it enough that you’re satisfied with it
thats really it
which i guess is why im not buddhist
otherwise theres no point in believing in it
i just assume that if you’re going to believe in reincarnation the next obvious assumption is to try and make progress through those incarnations of yourself 
i don’t claim to be buddhist, nor do i claim to know buddhism any more than anyone else.
i could say that i will but i already believe that you know what you’re talking about 
again i did say pseudo, cause that shit sounds kinda dumb
i didn’t know that but you won the semantics war there
okay
if you don’t want to label it
or at least a perpetuation of your being
reincarnation implies a soul to be reincarnated 
and has within it a reincarnation system 
buddhism stems from a reincarnation system
i said pseudo
all that matters is achieving nirvana, whatever that means to you personally
i kinda ended up with a pseudo buddhism
i think those concepts are bs
yes
aside from other people saying “hey i don’t like that”
a soul brings perpetuity into it but theres no reason to believe that anything is right and anything is wrong
why would it do that?
no
eric don’t kill anyone
i think eric falls in that category, so i don’t think there’s anything actively wrong with what he wants and what he’ll do to get that, unless he kills someone
if not, fuck it, make as much money as you can and make sure your children are set
as for cosmic scale, i only bring it up because somewhere along the line i made the conscious decision to believe in the existence of the human soul. the human experience wouldnt take place on a cosmic scale, but your soul would, so for someone who believes in a soul that shit would matter
the fact of the matter is that most parents love their kids
well should and are are two different things i think the should has always been there, but i doubt it has ever been followed through with to a meaningful percentage 
inherent meaning because of unlikelyness is stupid and inherent unmeaning without value is also stupid. I’d say inherent unmeaning because of the passage of time is also stupid but i said that shit and nothing i say is stupid once im 6 shots deep
thats literally the only interpretation that makes sense.
yeah i agree on pretty much all accounts 
well
and i only care because i’d love to hear them
i only care what your views are
i don’t care about the validity of your views
i haven’t actually heard an opinion like that that wasn’t from my dad and we’ve established what my dad has done so im very interested
why?
what are your thoughts on the ego and the spiritual self?
unfortunate. you are simply too late to the party
with the added bonus of invalidating your complaints because you knew i was going to do it to you and you could have said “shut the fuck up, mars” but you didn’t
completely genuine 
completely genuine 
before i did it
i mean i did explicitly say i was gonna do that
don’t say my transition wasn’t smooth as fuck cause it was
ie: my progeny get to keep going and yours don’t, which has no effect on the overarching course of evolution and is only important as a method of feeling good about yourself 
there isn’t a reason to compete with other people outside of the most basic, animalistic, gene pool competition 
which i personally think is a useless attribute of the self.
they all stem from a viewpoint that is dominated by the ego, the self that views itself in comparison to everything else
like, instead of im sorry, i’d say: i apologize eric, but as much as we agree on the end results of our idealized societies, I think your reasoning and your motivations are kinda bullshit at times and downright stupid at others.
that way instead of saying “im sorry” you’d have to say “i apologize” which takes too much fuckin effort and is a waste of time
replace it with apologize 
actually i think its pretty fair to eliminate the word sorry from your personal dictionary 
stop doing it you’ll feel better about yourself
that’s literally nothing
like dudes will apologize for tapping elbows
like maybe i shouldn’t bring it up, cause i used to do it all the time, but i trained myself out of it for work, and now it’s kinda fucked
on a completely unrelated note isn’t it fucking weird when people apologize for no reason 
theres no excuse for going balls deep for no reason
your estimation is correct 
very true
yeah
he graduated college without lifting a finger
my dad used to fuck fat bitches so they’d write his papers for him.
cause i’m a picky piece of shit
i don’t even want to fuck most of the girls i meet
a real chad would have a fuckin massive boner for every lady that has the desire
maybe that’s gay
but like idk
lock yourself in a room with no lights and no responsibilities for two days and try and make something of yourself 
but shrooms and acid can help
it can be hard
ez living
just gotta adopt that chad mentality man
i don’t compete with dildos, therefore i don’t compete with other men.
they’ll use condoms and shit. theres no difference between that and a dildo
because women that are suitable for you are smart enough to vet their guys and stay safe
and at a certain point it doesn’t actually have any impact 
women will always get sex
basically, but that doesn’t matter
but there are no 20 year old female virgins
the ones that say they are are lying.
thats just a fact of life
i mean during this period she’ll be getting dicked by some shitfuck bastard
1 isn’t enough 
yes
also take like 2 weeks to cool off before making that decision 
 a chance is better than no chance. you just have decide if you think she’s worth the greater effort you’ll have to put in to take her now
and im sorry for your pain
i see... did option 2 happen?
liar
liar
why are you posing this question?
so what the fuck
i would have shot it two years ago but she was in thailand.
because i want it and i would regret not having it more than i would having it
they’re divorced. do i shoot my shot? yes.
for instance i’d fucking die for a piece of this girl Iona, but she lives in San Fran and married a thai girl at 19
it’s all about maximizing the attainment of your desires while minimizing your regrets
if you have to spend months winning a bitch over her shit bf, and she isn’t what you really want, and you still do it, you kinda played yourself 
the time investment
thats really what matters
if you judge the taking of the thot to be worth your time, ofc
then just be the bigger chad and take her from her bf
so if she admits that she’d go out with you if she were single, and she ISNT lying to not hurt your feelings
so if she admits that she’d go out with you if she were single, and she ISNT lying to not hurt your feelings
that shit only matters when you’re married
that shit only matters when you’re married
and also because when dating relationship status doesn’t matter
but only because it pads your ego
the latter
shoot
but for the sake of being as retarded as possible while im still drunk, im not gonna talk about any of that, and im instead gonna steer the conversation even further from reality 
if i can get a job at a fuckin production company eric can get into tech
eric has his padding and he’s good enough at what he does that he’ll get hired at whatever he applies to
regardless nothing argued in the last 15 mins has any grounds in reality so it’s kinda useless
that’s unfortunate 
lul
ok the 3 years of Chinese school probably pads that out
all your savings is being spent on tuition and housing 
all your savings is being spent on tuition and housing 
cause in this metaphorical world nobody pays for your anything
what work?
did you work for those savings?
so if for some reason nobody decides to hire you out of college and you were out of work for 3 months, would you consent to being killed for the sake of society?
eric i dont think that your ego could handle working a low wage menial job
gwyn has a point
if you have to catch your food, and a member of your tribe can’t run, you leave that worthless fuck behind
im a fuckin machine ;)
well thats the only way it’d happen
my family can take care of themselves
i never want to be on life support 
im upset by how well that describes my own internally conflicting worldviews
if i was unable to function i would have myself offed
so your thinking is limited by that, eric
at a certain point we’ll have migrated off this shit planet and onto wherever we need.
except at a certain point resources wont matter
pretty much
the answer to that is no, cause people are worthless.
the question is if it’s worth it
we’ll have the ability to care for all those people 
especially when AI take over
yes, because to some degree we can
thats why you dash your malforme baby’s head against the rocks
thats what it was
industrial revolution changed a lot of conceptions around human value
well 200 years
until like the past 80 years
and the value has never been set at a base line of “invaluable”
most early civilizations valued life much more harshly 
well
thats true eric
thats the lie
but if a massive amount of idiots contribute 2 dollars to feeding an african child, you can feed an african village
thats a fucking lie
no it doesn’t 
everything but people
only the individual contributions matter
because individuals don’t matter
value doesnt matter
i mean sure
[1572241670] Gwyn Bateman-Shirley: the possible combinations of things that COULD exist VASTLY exceeds the possible combination of things that DO exist

&lt;&lt;&lt;  i believe that this isn’t true
and i choose to not make that assumption 
but thats making the assumption that there aren’t other states that everything exists in
and not in any other
well gwyn, you’re trying to argue that everything is meaningful because it exists in its current state
no american is gonna be ghandi
no
neither is more important than the other
with set up americans you have potential bill gates 
with impoverished dirt people you have potential ghandis
fuck potential it’s dependent on that individual to sieze that potential 
yes really
i think your societal values are pointless. both the african child and the american child will die and everyone will forget them
idk im drunk as shit
there is no other option but egoism
and if you aren’t happy it’s ultimately your fault
yes
the only meaning to life is to the individual 
on a personal level you need a reason for yourself
but there are so many individual perspectives that any single one does not matter on a cosmic scale
it may have not been pointless if there werent 7 billion people on this planet 
nah i still say that’s pointless 
no
but im not gonna do that for you degenerate fucks, yall can suck my dick.
but i could talk about my personal beliefs for an hour until every piece fits neatly together and you achieve a much greater understanding of me as a person
and fuck you kirkegaard is an insightful motherfucker
and anything that anyone else has to say on the matter is not only false, but also retarded
and searching for my reasons/meaning for living is slowly curing my crippling depression, so i can only assume that i am one hundred percent correct on this matter
but everyone has to find a reason otherwise they’ll just keep being unfulfilled and unhappy
i just think that there isn’t an all encompassing meaning
well not really 
yes
took me till now to finish, but yeah
this is pretty fuckin good
weebs
jojo and chill
small dick game design, appealing to the normies
gg wp
the shitty casuals
still should restart
xd
is that a nier automata boss or something?
he shoots missiles and flies?
vordt
bruh that's just retextured vort
you don't have to restart?
....
truly harty
actually just delete the champion
and remove her ult
and put a longer cd on the jump
have her be stunned if the person she's riding dies, for like 0.75 seconds
but i still think they should gut her into nonexistence
that was the worst thing
yuumi literally exists in that world
but at the same time
xdddd
and the shadow isles were cool before they made thresh a pussy that got beat by a dindu with a gun
i like shurima
thats it
yeah
uh
ashe lore is good
league’s lore is getting slowly better
americans are lucky the government isn’t taking away their guns yet
(you dont)
fuckin nice
accurately?
rly
but when that's done there's no use for them
i mean rn you just need low level grunts to catalogue all the current non digital information into digital format
so you deserve it
but if you're trying to get into banking in 2017+ you're retarded
it's easier on them
i can see that happening, actually.
archeology will definitely not be delegated to ai
maybe at most like low level service industry will get outmoded
which i don't think will happen in our lifetimes
another reason to specialize in creative jobs
^
not having smelly fucked up breath is good
thanks mom.
and i greatly appreciate it
my mom keeps sending me a shitton of toothpaste
yeah that helps
you're better off than a lot of americans
i mean if you can handle your own personal financing without outside help
l o l
those actually need degrees
like comp sci, programming, all that crazy fucking shit that eric talks about that i tune out
just business
im not talking sciences really
i mean definitely
this is why you go into creative ventures, at least then you get judged at face value based on the merits of your shit. so when people don't want to pay you they don't have any excuses other than, "fuck you your shit sucks."
and then when you're finally done, nobody wants to hire you. Because you apparently don't know how to work those easy ass jobs that you've been studying years to learn. At least not better than Joe fucking Dickass who's been working there for four years and brings a goddamn spiderman lunchbox to work.
but it still sheds years of your life that you could be spending making money on getting taught how to work easy ass jobs to make money. and accruing massive amounts of debt
or being born black and just getting into college for free cause system says so
the only way around this is either being born rich and going to private schools that show real nice on job applications, or being born lucky and getting into programs that get you out of public schools
so their entire design is to filter kids into those colleges so the owners can squeeze all the money out of them and send them out in the world to pay off their debts
our government edubation systems are essentially run by college owners
except
the problem is that you need a degree in the first place
restructure universities, they suck
agreed
or they'll just shit you out with the other interns that they shit out
it's like half cost freelo work, and if you're good and they like you you they'll decide to hire you.
not for the students
for the companies
but it kind of is an effective practice
school sponsored internships definitely are though
well it's a different type of work and i don't think outside jobs are counted on official school records
or, a successful internship with a decent recommendation
having an internship on your record doesn't look bad at all
yeah and they're really not wrong, either
bruh you posted cat ezreal fuuuuuuuuck.
I need to bleach my eyes
no
yeah you’re right
already
also fuck riot for putting out new qiana skins
senna’s getting shafted here
isn’t senna’s just her release skin?
im fuckin dead
or no rng effects
theres no card draw at all?
what do you mean no rng?
yes brother
housing
just make sure your house has a nice view
perfect 
l o l
the stock is decent though
yeah but that doesn’t account for how often they’ll need you to stay overtime/ be on call
and then hours
so what department they put me in, what im doing etc
actually depends on how hard im working for that
i mean i can live perfectly fine on 112k
well if he’s happy then screw it
nah he fucked up
oh LOL
he’s still in college so ofc it is
oof
v fair
except i don’t really want to play league on my phone
and same probably 
riot has so much money that if they shit this up seppuku would be a perfectly valid option for their entire upper management staff.
maybe later
no wai
no
focus?
okok
oh
drag?
do you move with a touch pad or by tapping?
its the same version, isn’t it?
console league is just shitty league with worse controls and less champions, no way thats good
but they’re the same thing, so it’s still a tf2 clone in the end
paladins is better than ogrecock
that looks like way early development 
or is it a siege clone? i don’t know.
a card game, console league (puke) and an overwatch clone
i didn’t watch that stream
no
wtf
league card game
no
theodore is definitely not asleep
alvin looks like she’s biting his dick off
same
but children of dune is the third book in a series that nobody reads past the first one. it’s entirely worthless.
so im gonna go ahead and change my previous statements. I agree with Eric. We should execute all poor people and replace them with robots.
so im gonna go ahead and change my previous statements. I agree with Eric. We should execute all poor people and replace them with robots.
the other shit has a bit of value to the average human shitstain
they could have left me the book and I would have understood 
im pissed cause my backpack is an old piece of shit thats falling apart. The only things of value inside it are my phone charger, my passport, and fuckin Children of Dune which, so far, was a fucking fantastic book.
also i fell asleep on the bus on my way home and woke up in gardena with my backpack missing 
nobody is 6’7, rocco, my youngest brother will be in like 2 years
 and he’s gonna be a fuckin 6’7 pos jackass with a chip on his shoulder 
but as soon as rocco turns13 he’s gonna be 6’7
tbey both play basketball so it’s mostly about who’s better at that, and lucky wins cause he’s like 2 feet taller with his growth spurt
and currently size 10 for rocco (11) and 11 for lucky (14)
they argue about anything cause they hate each other
sorry i got caught up
lmao
your mental is weak as fuck
don’t think about big feet but both of my brothers are obsessed with shoe size
8
accurate?
that the starvation of the poor will never be legalized 
wow lag
so im satisfied. dont actually care if you get it or not
i said my piece though 
me too it was going nowhere
its a based ass reason and you know it
i want no people to work
its a based ass reason and you know it
... yes
thats why i want a big ass shower with a bench built into it
but in the shower, these things are a nonissuean
nope. I don’t want to touch my piss, but i do want to touch the chick. The goals clash. I don’t want to wait for her to clean herself firstt
i like pissing. I don’t like pissing on other people
rly?
wo
we aren’t comparing our selves, we’re comparing our world-views, which is con
and some people like piss
well this argument isn’t a pissing contest
yes
and you should just off yourself xd
if you need to compare yourself to others on a financial level to feel good about yourself 
heres what i think
ok
how much of that 70k is covered by your job eric?
I can see what you mean Eric, there’s literally no reason for it. cause feeling good doesn’t count. The “Do unto others what you want done to yourself” mentality is literally something that only makes sense if it’s hammered into you
Yeah
i only hold the door for women and the elderly 
theres no way you actually believe the words you just said
ok i think you’re definitely meming now
ok i think you’re definitely meming now
d e a d, fuckin  w r o n g
once again
change topic
your argument is retarded because it stems from a basis of retardation
your definition of altruism is retarded
being satisfied isnt a physical benefit
ok but
is done for personal satisfaction 
all altruism 
ok
because you said nobody
it’s entirely false
just false
thats
even voting barely matters 
but it was marketed on the fact that it supports the people
it doesn’t support the people
regardless, that’s why our society is dick ass shit. 
or, hmm. An ideal life is one that isn’t a competition 
its correct thats how you earn a good life for yourself and your future generations 
and that sort of retarded ass idea is what the current society inspires
your personal imput into that machine is unimportant 
the point is to optimize the genes of the collective so the whole becomes better than it is
no fuck your genes
but rn it is
but life isn’t meant to be a competition 
maybe at videogames
because you’re not and never will be better than anyone else
thats the wrong viewpoint
You know how many people actually achieve that? None.
the point of working to financial success is to live having whatever you want without any worries 
yeah right now it is
financial success is meaningless
fuck those people
you figure out what would make you feel fulfilled as a person and do that
you stop having to care about doing well financially 
yes
or someone who does something that is enjoyed by the most people
success becomes someone who is the happiest 
we just change that definition of success
if we remove the need for monetary success
yeah in our current society
and neither should you
cause i don’t give a fuck what other people have
yeah
im just gonna say
alright
you don’t know those people.
saying, “They don’t want to change,” would make more sense but is still a huge generalization 
massive because of the quantity of people
they can’t change
that definitely isn’t true
thats a massive assumption 
well
the fact that their is a homeless population means our country is overpopulated 
and im not sure if censors account for homeless population 
i think your idea of overpopulated is way different than mine
very not wasteful
though
we could totally use their organic matter as fertilizer 
i mean
incredibly wasteful
high
too
the birth rate is way too high
nah it’s overpopulated 
that destroys the economy
not riot material 
that’s “ok time to start killing people” material .
thats not riot material
its easier, but the humanitarians exist
i get where you’re going
like
without inciting a massive civil war
that would never happen
we cant
and too many people on the planet
there are too many people in america
but
okay
i also think that we should get rid of our current concept of society
cause it won’t work in the long run
no
if all menial labor was outsourced to robots it would free up space for people to do other things
and working for someone else isn’t a purpose, it’s making a living
to your paycheck
[1571024359] Miles O'Brien: human need job because human have feeling, computer no feel, computer no need job

&lt;&lt;&lt; this is objectively false. Work sucks therefore humans would feel better with computers doing it.
jett was arguing that we need to fix the income inequality in america and eric literally never said that shouldn’t happen, but you guys argued about it like he had
i think from an objective standpoint, this is the correct answer
personally, im gonna jack my dick like it’s the last day on earth and hope the next life is cooler than this one.
so like wtf you gonna do?
but even then if global warming is as bad as people say half that shit could be under water before the end of our lifetimes
if you’re smart you move to europe or australia 
Hopefully before that time comes we get visited by aliens and they force us to band together as the singular nation of Earth or some shit. Or we die so we don’t have to deal with it.
the most anyone can do now? is just live how they want as much as they can before a nation gets the balls to call the US on its bullshit and fuck us.
nation is literally in trillions of dollars of debt
america’s financial foundation is built on lies, loans, and promises that nobody has any intention of keeping 
how would you possibly fix this country’s shitty economy without causing a total collapse and bankrupting the entire world
personally i think that arguing for or against that shit is retarded
i don’t like it and im an impoverished black, chicken suckin nigga
he still gets fucked by americas systems because they treat his class as if it were the uber rich, while letting those other fuckers get away scott free and he still has to deal with the affirmative action bullshit which we ALL agree is bullshit
maybe upper middle class
eric’s family isnt rich
because, and here’s some crazy shit
eric if you had replaced “white people” with “rich people” all your arguments would have landed
ok i actually read it now
you’ll just have to trust that im right, here
I didn’t actually read it so
there, i think i summed it up
addendum: and so is eric
tldr china’s big gay and so is jett
or i’ll just make one myself
or i’ll just make one myself
need a tldr
trying to load this conversation broke my phone
flesh eating attack donkeys?
aint that a bit much?
rest in peace hedgefundhog
Kappa
not even wrong, rly
which
because they fuckin push it like it’s their only selling point
Short guys with big dicks are funny in general 
cause proportions
but when you’re rly tall it doesn’t 
when you’re short a 6 incher looks p big
on a technical level it kinda works like that
i mean
yeye
aight boys, i now officially live in a tiny hole like 5 minutes away from eric
you know that means eventually, there will be nothing left for people to do
doing what you truly want to do is good for you,
knowing what's good for you is knowing what you want
what the fuck is he gonna care
like a lawyer that wants to be an actor but was pressured into it by everyone in his surroundings
if they don't actually know what they want, they won't reach that high level of quality because there won't be that drive to be better behind it
people can learn, they just need to know what they want
fix the climate issue by utilizing the human resource
use their ashes to regrow forests
and then we can stuff everyone else into camps and cremate them
yeah well i agree on all counts.
i see
say culinary jobs
what about specific cases, where a person treats a specific menial job like a craft
okay
i can't say you're wrong. it's mostly the older generations that like being serviced by other people
you mean they'll just upload their selves into the cloud
oh
and will that person be a guy?
so the pinnacle human gets to just lay back and think about what shit might be new, while getting fed rare delicacies and sucked off by robots
there's no way that an ai will be able to emulate that shit
the quality is the problem
researchers
uh
sexworkers
the industries that really survive will be
so essentially
well im down with that
okay
haha
cause im sure somewhere down the line we'll have the technology to make ai that can come up with ways to advance technology as a whole
i see.
intellectual
what do you define as intellectial labor?
so we don't get to a point where it's legitimately better to cull people that don't meet a certain criteria than it is to have them sitting around being homeless and shit. 
cause you need to have places to sort people
as long as you don't have ai's taking up fields of research it's fine
i mean sure
the point is to not make the human race redundant as a whole, but to elevate it beyond it's current level.
humans are only really useful for their ideas. if anyone decides to make an ai that can generate it's own completely unique ideas, someone better shoot that guy in the head and burn his research
in general you listen to music to listen to the musicians
you don't listen to music just to hear sounds and shit though
and that's a shitty process
ai generated music sucks
ai generated entertainment rn sucks
ai's can handle everything else really
but the human race as a whole won't have use for them. the three things afterwards that'll be useful will be r&amp;d, design and construction, and entertainment
or they'll work in the service industry, or they'll join mlms/ low level telecom marketing
but what'll really happen is that people just won't pick up their slack and become homeless due to there not being enough jobs for them, or them not meeting the artificial standards set by jobs
in order to counteract that, colleges could become more affordable in order to pump out more children with degrees to fill up the higher tier jobs
then a goooood portion of our society becomes essentially useless
once ai starts replacing manual labor enmasse
i mean
hahah
that shits so good
yall nibbas haven’t seen american psycho?
hol up
dota's map is bad
and if you won the train fight your whole team gets a buff or something
and kill people on
that you could jump on
just imagine if it had a train that ran through the middle of it
but
why im still up? who knows
but map is good
or wet clay
yeah the character models look like poop.
cause fuck teammates
now they just need to add a solos mode that isn't a rotating gamemode.
it looks like respawn looked at all the shit that made the game fun and then just fucking smacked a giant train in the middle of it to kill people on. true genius. this is why bungie and respawn are the only fps devs that i'll ever trust to consistently deliver good shit.
there are so many fucking ziplines around it
i'm thinking of creating a petition. henceforth all battle royales have to have a train that carries loot around.
but i guess that's it.
until now, i didn't know that that was all it took to get me legitimately hyped for battle royales
that moves
apparently the new map for apex legends has a train
let that game die
speedwagon is the best stand
dont give in to temptation diego
actually it looks like his degenerate team was worse than yours in that picture
with the most degenerate team
against penisretard69
you played
bruh
or, it should be.
it’s playable in plat
Just play jungle
Pretty much
oof
whats your mmr?
lmao
Yes. This would be fun
Ah
But I’d love to see him try
I don’t think milo can beat em wasted
suboptimal gameplay
also milo i wanna see you stream yourself rocking the abyss watchers.
so i stopped watching it
but then he didn't stomp on genichiro's head when he jumped the sweep.
i was watching that sekiro video
miles
xd
didn't beat genichiro
oh
so it took the title because of seniority
sekiro came first
anime dark souls is sekiro
so that spot is taken
code vein is gay dark souls
you bought code vein?
if its controlled by a guy
wait in midas mode can roshan move around?
but not ashe.
lucian can get away with it cause he’s black. Thresh can get away with it cause he’s a floating cow skull
cause no southern twang
but the high noon skin sounds like shit
auto based
she prays to kindred
new base ashe VO is based
so it sounds like steaming hot garbo when she says “Howdy partner” with the emphasis on all the fucking consonants 
wild west ashe doesn’t have a southern accent 
happy birthday 
the 23rd day of september?
do you remember?
fortnite dubskis
kms
league gay, just give it a few months so we can play boarderlands 
some people 
some people 
so?
mens have ways of settling these things
tbh
*him
dude shoulda punched it
shoulda got his experimenting done in elementary school like the rest of us
dude just has issues then
and dry humped
grinded?
there are easier ways
i mean
to go to jail so he can fuck boys?
dox him and send him glitter bombs
cyber him
we should blow up his phone
so he can get passed around by ripped cholos
well lock that dumb nigga up
oh
*order
bail and like a restraining orcer
i mean stalking chicks is still creeper shit, but i’d be able to understand bail
or just stalk?
did he rape her?
i do know the ps2 version had split screen
i don't think it does
that game was my shit
i don't even want anything on there, but fuck i'll take a free san andreas
not sure if yall nibbas heard, but rockstar made a games launcher and they're giving away gta san andreas on it for free.
oh
huh, cool.
when did you go to vegas?
don't want retarded people having their way
^
esp not over something stupid,
just don't like get sent to the hospital or anything.
can't fault you for that, I suppose.
alright then
deeefinitely
getting hurt is opt-in
fucking is the point.
fuzzy cuffs so nobody gets hurt and nobody starts signing lawsuits
fuzzy cuffs
yeah
those complex ties and shit that the weebs like are way too much
and don't overdo it
well just be good with your hands.
never.
but yeah seems about right
98% rigger, 97% rope bunny. i don't know where those got uneven
^
that shit's too sketchy
i wouldn't even think of forming a relationship with someone off tinder or smth
gotta suss em out 
yeaah
but one night stands are a tossup
well yeah
better than forcing or egging someone into some shit they don't wanna do
well eh vanilla is cool if that's all your girl is cool with
same
gaaaaayyyy
gay
didn't expect vanilla to be at 44, but it was
i got pretty much the same thing
ya
i honestly don't think anything will have changed. I was switch the first time, and i'll be switch this time.
last time, gwyn your scores were almost the opposite of this iirc. but you still had vanilla in its rightful place at the bottom, so respec.
alright i'll retake this damn test
Wyeth sounds like girl Wyatt

i think i'd be down
if dark souls was a roguelike
it's gun dark souls
oh actually i have seen that
i actually have no idea what that is
that seems like a decently good time to bool
It's mine too
so lets find some time to bool out
dogsitting/housesitting for my uncle
im gonna be pretty close to samo for a few weeks from the 20th to sept 5th
if only riot had everyone’s backs
if only
which is different enough from the normal one that i do
i guess the last ahri skin was november 2018 unless you count the prestige skin
nah
for an ahri skin?
Indeed it does
cause then they'd be cool
im mad at riot’s priority list basically 
im mad that they didn't also make a kindred skin
im not mad that they made the ahri skin
i want to kill myself for allowing myself to get my hopes up
fuckin ahri
they made this shit
instead of making the best possible, most requested skin, for the best character in their game
but i am now
i hadn't deleted league yet
and kindred was not one of them
riot released new elderwood skins
fucking
(noworries)(noworries)(noworries)(noworries)(noworries)(noworries)
still gay though
still gay though
tft is fun
Delicious
and healthy
videogames are good
but yeah
also liver damage is only semi-permanent if you have the cash
technically the skins aren't permanent
ok maybe im just a fiend
well
it's easy to do that in a few hours
in fact
it's rly easy to rack up over a hundred in a night
its not
yeah
you mean league or videogames?
oh
kill me i don't want this information
Happened
Happened
cursed af

he sucks his boys off so they feel refreshed
here
You better be
I am excited too
it did
thats how good it is
and i honestly forgot that there was an intro
i don’t know
It’s the only thing where the quote, “I’ve gotta make an announcement, Shadow the Hedgehog is a bitch ass motherfucker. He pissed on my fucking wife. That’s right, he took his hedgehog quilly dick out and he pissed on my fucking wife, and he said his dick was ’this big’ and I said that’s disgusting. So I’m making a callout on my twitter page. Shadow the Hedgehog, you’ve got a small dick...” and have it work
i realize that this is actually the best thing ever made
now that i’ve gotten through half the video
actually 
this is mostly for milo’s benefit
I am worried
I was worried
across the face is more like it. backhand for max respect 
upside the head isn’t all that different from treating em like another guy
im not sure i’ll be able to not talk

ez
best parts of e3
bloodlines and cyberpunk
post 12 everyone who hasn’t said good morning triple gay
morning
when evaluating artists though, it’s the other way around 
i think you take the songs at face value first, but if the songs are about the artist then you have to view it in light of them
good morning 
Parsa works in the desert
So I can confidently assume
Why Uniqlo tho
We miss you Milo 
isn’t this new champ just sivir?
but w/e

i know it is
but my character for milo's campaign is fuckin ready
idk about you guys
idk about that one boss
oh you're fuckin kidding
barely legal
or ask for a job
just don’t be retarded and say how old you are
but yea i can most likely sneak you some booze
skype had no response for that one lmao
dumb fucking fags
and that stopped 
then the gays realized that they didn’t need the bar to be gay to be gay in it
the place got picketed like 2 times in the first month after it opened 
deadass
and yeah
*dad
used to be a gay bar before my sad bought it and rebranded
because it means you can drink for free with me at my bar
but you wanna be in like west hollywood/silverlake area
ktown is in the center of everything 
downtown is the real shit
fair nough
on 2 occasions there was human feces left inside the trash chute room.
as in like
the place i was in was 3500 and it was shitty
a 2500 2 bedroom is likely gonna be really really shitty
i'd like to add
huh?
wait
including any if yall negus
or i’ll find a spot on my own and whoever wants to move in with me can
after that i’ll either move in with some of the dudes from my job
my dads for the summer
I am proud of you too
feelsgoodman
90% done moving 
I guess I do
What are you asking?
other chat is better
and now have some old memes
lion gay

but my schedule is fucked to shit and will remain fucked to shit for the forseeable future 
i know im a day late
and the d
i want the d
milo whens your campaign?
Oh well.

against emma you just run up and FUCK HER SHIT UP
Yes, indeed
flipper baby
i would have skipped ranks, but i quit league for sekiro
skipped ranks with a 30% wr???
we’ll see if the homeless dude is still alive in the morning 
so i took the doughnuts he had bought and left behind and gave those and the weed i bought to a homeless guy right around the corner 
and then he just took off toward the liquor store 
so i bought some nasty ass weed from some dude at the california doughnut shop by my house
those are mine
i’ll take my books though 
if i run into a guy with a gun im just gonna give him my backpack 
idk 
l m a o
and this week i found a guy who got fucked up at my bar, fell off his bike on his way home, and got a major concussion 
last week i ran into a dude who tried to smoke meth with me
so the tuesday walking home ritual is definitely the best idea i’ve ever had
cause that shit was a dumpster fire
i guess we're the unlucky ones then
oh
ay what do you nerds think of that new game of thrones?
(yes)
the broken apostrophe just makes it better
here
i responded to old ass messages 
oh wo
but. dont you keep your attack power on ng+? 
(puke)
FUCK no
on monday however i can be there early 
if its on sunday 
i won’t be there till 9
woo
fuck you michael
yuh
victory at any cost, that is the ashina way
seven spears is the only motherfucker who kills you for countering him so you might be right there michael
if isshin is scared of him thats it
everyone else is slaughtered by him
ezpz
demon of hatred is the strongest 
The parent is absolute, their will must be obeyed 
ONE!

ezpz

god hand is a banger in general 
god hand is a banger in general 
(y)
(smile)
(laugh)
then hit that shit again.
then go to sleep
miles if we’re being honest, i’d probably go get really high.
look at this fuckin idiot destroy himself on the internet.
i am in town on that day
im not into that shit
for me
would be weird
so i think it worked out.
but instead i let her smoke me out after work and now she wants me to smash her daughter.
you raise a good point.
and i'd rather smash her daughter.
she was like 48
nah
good thing it's a photoshop
this shirt makes me unreasonably unhappy.
wish me luck vros
and im gonna fuck her in the office.

until a new kindred skin comes out 
im gonna uninstall league when i get home
i miss the good champions

Haha, you already know
I know I can

he was strong as shit regardless, though
i can ask him
but he comes by the bar every once in a while
i forgot his name tbh
Why yes, it is
last month
it's a dude i met like
i know a guy who wants to give everyone dmt
xd
fuck kanye and the blacks
(laugh)
Is it?
glorius
(ok)(ok)(ok)(ok)(ok)(ok)(ok)(ok)
Fair enough.
like jose bautista or john cena
the opposite of feminine
i would think the ideal body type for a gay dude is like
Yeah, I guess so
cause
im willing to take your word on this
u sure?
the equivalent of just massive tiddies?
but to gay guys isnt that like
i know
but that reminds me that i really want to do a shot right about now
im always never drunk
we’re talking about the “superior male” here
and as a followup, do my nigmas think they got swole just so they could rub one out to themselves?
Real talk, do gay body builders get super turned on looking in the mirror?
the range on mortal blade is too short though, so that's nice
lmao
which is which?
im sure those billionaires just want their names on the place
xD
the bag?
LOL
that you can use the spear on guardian ape
i just learned
Okay, I forgive you
whew
i mean we could put a straw in your mouth and leave you in there for a few days
that goes beyond claustrophobia
i think
sounds dank
i’ve alway wanted to try erotic vacuum sealing without a safe word
damn
no safe word?
it should be pineapple
fuck outta here with that
that emoji
makes it less fun
children can’t fight back
or do you prefer papi
hit me daddy
im an everything threat
make yourself an easier target
i have little to no ammunition 
SO WHIPPED
AS FUCK
but also, WHIPPED
im just fucking with you, feel free to ignore me
whipped harder than uti, even
sounds to me like you’ll be whipped
and work a high stress high pay job
wait she wants to wear the pants?
fuck your .12 bitcoin i don’t even want it
yeah thats what im saying
.12 is 600
good catch
i don’t care anymore 
oh nvm its .12
it might be this oscar fucker
thats 60 thou
f u c k
how do i take advantage of this
or an account with my phone number
somehow my phone number just got transferred 12 bitcoin
also
can we equate your pizza to coke?
depends on the food
tips are the lifeblood of any service industry job
oh right
i forget you don’t get to make any tips
fuck
240 from 13 hrs???
unless you have everything handed to you and you dont have to spend 6-8 months job hunting when you’re done
working gay when you’re out of school
i give a f u c k?
think
do you
need based scholarships work when you’re not in college 
need based scholarships work when you’re not in college 
milo will give it to you
with the free drinks
we’ll hook you up
if you ever want a job my bar will take you 
thats why the editing function exists 
thats why the editing function except 
it do be like that at times
AH
wait why are we talking about buying cars in general?
in fact they arent an investment at all
cars terrible investment
you can’t really rent or flip cars
or flip
with real-estate you can rent
in terms of property value
cars are more like homes
 they’re very different 
so my best bet at gaining some passive income is to kill my brothers and sisters and inherit all of those for myself 
honestly, my dad owns 5 properties around LA
big initial investment though
ezpz
t h i s
^this
the robot overlords do their jobs better
idk about that
because the fact that people are stupid is immutable
my point still stands
because they don’t know any better
2 generations from now parents will still tell their kids to become doctors
and guess what
you get the fulfillment from saving lives or some shit
i guess
as long as he wants it
okay
does he want to be a doctor?
which means more debt
with a 300k debt
he gets a shit start too
weston
what field is he studying in?
why?
how?
oof???
thats the difference between UC and USC
to fix that mistake
i edited
that will last you after college
that will last you after college
sor
as long as you’re comfortable being poor
this is also an optimal strategy 
xd
i’ll edit whatever i want. even this message.
i’ll edit whatever i want. even this message.
that there is small dick energy
that there is small dick energy
yes you can
just doing in your spare time while you work your regular job
it wouldn’t be over a regular job
in the 3 or 4 years it takes for all the kids of these antivax parents to die
i mean even sooner than that
we aren’t selling to their kids
antivaxxers are the parents
LMAO
yeah
or me
just ask milo
but working a job isn’t worth anyway
absolutely never again
*gofundme type service
oh you mean setting up a gofundme?
so the ones giving the money is us
the person setting it up is us
i havent used gofund me
and depending on how stupid the donations are that could be work
well we do have to actually set up the connections to those charities 
yeah
put them on hold for 30 minutes while i fuck up the demon of hatred
i think i’d be great at customer support 
i’d like that second one though
you won’t know my address come may
and because you don’t want anyone knocking on your fucking door
you could rent a small office space for 75 a month im sure
thats a very fair point
^^^^
and cali taxes are high
cause cali laws are strict
and they gon get theirs
because the government wants theirs
im sure the more fanatical ones will be ready for round 2
yeah
hmm
discriminated against
i mean
then prove the earth is round
donate to flat earth research 
yeah
it depends on what we do with the 90% of the money
it’s not legal
7 on smart people
they’re antivaxxers
they won’t care
11%
mix some illegal drugs in there too and i’ll start walking to SC tonight
follow it to the letter
nanana
irs is still fucked from that government shutdown last month
irs is still fucked from that government shutdown last month
if there was ever a time it’d be now
this is a quality plan
yeah see
that’s investing
exactly 
and that could take a long time
we won’t get a paycheck for ourselves until those investors are paid
while running this hypothetical business 
and that means that
you have to pay them back eventually 
investors aren’t assets though
im assuming 
but we don’t 
yeah lmao
selling drugs is reselling though
theres a good idea
yes
i think we should try to capitalize on our own strengths
too much effort 
so manufacturing and reselling is gonna be a no from me dog
i want to make as much money as possible while doing as little work as possible 
look man
we could build a word of mouth advertising service 
that said, that one skill is pretty useful
*Idk
unless you count an excessive amount of willpower and big dick energy as something l
as far as anything else i’ve got nothing
so we could probably find those people and convince them to work for us
i think everyone in this chat has the capability to see people dumber than we are and recognize that those people are idiots 
well
also provided we weren’t autistic  faglords
provided the business doesn’t fall to shit in 5 or so years
then we could go and do the same the following year wherever else we want 
that way in 3-4 years we can take a tax deductible “business trip” to amsterdam and fuck up the whole place
i think it sounds like a good time to get all the boys together and start a business 
that sounds like rich people shit
horse racing takes too long to get into
its like a mikiri counter for babies
bruh doing a normal jump kick on any sweep deals huge posture damage
but no, that nigga a fake
i thought he had just starved himself half to death and fucked his shit all the way up
he actually got the fucking voice down enough to fool me
ah
what the fuck did papa franku do to his hair?
i got it d1
kind of easy in multiplayer
it's good
gotta hand it to a nigga who can play the shit outta some trumpet
wait miles that cover is actually pretty sick
That makes sense
yare yare daze
can’t even breathe subconsciously
manual breathers?
honestly thats gotta be at least four times worse than mouth breathing
for maximum stress relief and relaxation 
optimal is in through nose out through mouth
niggas really be out here mouth breathing
but that shit aint important 
and the auto response spam is a factor in all those notification popups
cause i didn’t say shit about not liking jojo shitposts
yeah
also parsa is terrible at explaining things
mouth breathers lul
Verily.
except not like outkast cause he’ll never have a quarter of the brain power that andre 3000 has
he should get over himself and just write feel-good party shit, like outkast
i just don’t think kanye is a good enough lyricist to write this pussy ass sadboi shit and get away with it
i’d appreciate it if he appreciated it, but he takes himself seriously so i judge him as if he takes himself seriously.
what was it?
that man has hundreds of beautiful dumb ass model bitches that would drop to their knees and suck his dick just to hear him say their names and he knows that. 
when has a relationship ever not worked out for kanye in the past 20 years?
say them plainly with your voice and don’t try to compensate for how fucking empty they are by pushing yourself 
but fucking read those lyrics you just sent
in general kanye is a pretty dry well when it comes to emotional depth, but he went from having some meaning, to none whatsoever in yeezus and pablo, and now he’s looped back around to pretending to have some sort of meaning in ye and kids see ghosts, because he finally realized that most people who aren’t monkeys or hoes don’t really want to listen to him jerk his dick on a concert stage.
because his parts don’t even make up half of the length of the fucking thing
good music cruel summer was alright but i’d argue that that album was barely kanye
kanye peaked at graduation 
fuck ghost town too
and fuck kanye
its angels9
no
is the banger of the decade
this fucking album
alright boys
jasmine or sandalwood all the way
sage smells shitty
hot is always in clay
it rly depends on that
is the sake hot or cold?
well hmm
*glass shot glasses
most places just serve it in glass glasses like assholes
that’s pretty dank
it’s out of the bowl things?
but worse tequila 
sake is like slightly better vodka
lived with 1 hp
i threw oil pots at him and set him on fire
that shit took too long tho
so i got good
hes dead
fuck the lone shadow swordsman
guys
pirate jet is the best gorillaz song

asian braised pork belly burger 
its a fucking
all yall negus should come get one
(laugh)
i’ve never been so psyched over food, i feel like a fatass
and im eating it right now
my job is bringing back my favorite burger ever made
that poster has my comedy relief  ass nigga really looking like he’s about to kill thanos
wait
Inconceivable!
Yes, it was
we’re good today brother 
im walking my dog and some random argentinians just gave me their weed
can't play sekiro
milo... own one of those?
doesn’t 
tf is this shit
epic games is cancer
Oh yes, haha
that fucking guardian ape
dunkey's sekiro video has convinced me that i need to buy sekiro
damb
jett, what the fuck?
fucking hilarious
thats
david's name on your skype is "racist"
weeblo is slowly draining my last remaining hopes for humanity 
sekiro is better dark souls confirmed?
I am just curious
ever
ever made
i think it’s ghost stories that has the best english dub ever
this is true
the same 5 dudes playing all the characters 
you’ve got like
english dubs r shit in general 
hey bambino sounds retarded
and so are the americans 
cause the japanese are fuckin stupid like that?
I meant it
(laugh)
fuck you, no free steak for you dickwad
but at the same time
i know
this is cancer of the highest order
and im liking it
my absolver friends convinced me to play apex
i hate myself 
Thank you very much!
that'll change your worldview
imma hit you with some shit
okay
don't
well
have you ever thought of watching jojo?
we gotta elevate your consciousness
i c
o o f
minimum brain
are you tryna tell me that you're operating on maximum brain or some shit?
milo's speech has only become more incomprehensible since his becoming a weeb
I love surprises
but that is to be expected
unbreakable, my niggas, unbreakable
Let's get it
F
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
does that mean you don’t have to play with a warwick top?
how is league now that eric quit?
wait
who can say no?
free steak?
sor 24th
yall negusi can come up until the 22nd
it’s not just tonight btw
How much is it?
not that much from the restaurant industry, but being able to talk up a product is super useful 
having good sales is always transferable between jobs
but nobody expects you to do that and honestly it may weird customers out
i mean if you wanna be sick and learn some shit you can try to start selling clothing items
so
you’re working in retail too
Me too
I have money
soft ripperino
so
but jobs are good
fuckin ripperino
damb
thats today?
oh yeah
eric’s out of town?
yeah
a bit of a commitment 
its an hour trip tho
yeah it does
like 2 blocks down from there
it’s right by the last stop of the expo line
kinda far
its in downtown 
she’s the manager, not the owner
3 at a time tops tho
not more than like
and we’ll eat free
and if you want some food you can come by
one of those all you can eatbrazilian steakhouses
my aunt just yesterday opened a new restaurant 
hey so
&lt;3
I got to argue with parsa at 11:30 at night. today ended up being a good day after all
Sweet dreams
bang gay
mumen rider is a meme
saitama and genos
there are 2 characters in the show
who cares about those characters though? they weren’t developed past “I exist and have X opinion on Y matter. then I do 1-2 things and Saitama saves the day.”
none that involve saitama
In the anime there aren’t any loose ends. They didn’t start developing any other plotlines. So a second season doesn’t have anything to go off of.
fuckin only read the first sentence dickhead
no, im saying there shouldn’t be more because they had a good ending
just read the manga if you want more. it had an incredibly solid ending, that you really don’t need to go on from
despite that
yes
the original ghost in the shell movie
you know whats good
one punch is good but they shouldn’t be making a second season of it
actually
fist of the north star is the shit
i’ll crush your stando with high quality animation and genuinely funny jokes
fuck your jojo
yep
cause that shit is hilarious 
fuck any anime that isn’t nichijou, actually. 
anime
and FUCK
SEKIREI
FUCK
i liked kill la kill cause of mako and the scene where the teacher started stripping during his monologue 
its the sounds, usually 
its not the words
or knocked loose
more like Nails
metallica metal
but not like
h a r d   disagree
how hard?
hmm
eva’s opening isnt jrock or jpop
i can do english metal
i would
i’ll respectfully disagree
so
i can’t willfully listen to jrock or jpop ever
and jojo is a work of art
and that base of a meme show is already held by jojo
cause its only good quality is for its memes
i’d still argue against it
it also gave us “dont shoot! that man’s not black!”
should have ended it with Z
dragonball super should never have existed
yeah
part 3 has joseph at his best imo
and are gay
cause it’s outrageous 
the writing is good
i just look at jojo memes
live jojo
i scored in the sociopath range
you did get everyone talking
Ha!
weebs to the pyre
for its year though it was a 10
nah kill la kill is a solid 8/10
milo’s right i did just wanna bust your balls
your mom 17
*show
in the shoe
she’s fuckin 16
she’s not in the show
that anime bitch is not 18
...change your picture back...
you look sick
good job from soft
and the grappling hook not having a cooldown is bery cool
i do like that they shat on dodge rolling
iron pineapple is the man
good video
or a drunk parent who trips
in my experience it’s usually some retard kid who trips over the power cable for the inflator thing. and parents who are too dumb to realize it.
awful way to go as a kid, death by suffocation in a collapsing bouncy house
i’ve been in 3 which makes me think it’s gotta be a pretty common occurrence 
while the floor is sucking you in cause it’s losing air 
and its just slowly falling on you
over your head
csuse all the fuckin material weighs like 80 pounds
shits big gay
until the thing collapsed with all the 10 year olds inside
have yall negus ever been stuck inside a collapsing bouncy house?
and i just kept throwing them at the walls
Yeah, I guess
Nothing
reminds me of a dream i had where i was getting attacked by 10 year olds in a fuckin bouncy house
i just thought it was funny that you got your ass whooped by 20 10 year olds
no
im gonna need the deets on that one
lmao
Nice meme
just found out that this is an actual sport. that exists 
i must be in a generous mood today. have this shit too.
skullgirls is the best fighting game
prove me wrong
don’t make it not look stupid 
for real though, black skin and bright orange hair really don't go together imo. looks weird
same shit dx
wait i look retarded in dota
now i’ve gotta play that game
they put me in dota
wait
(puke)
What do you know?
*though
it’s not free thougj
but more fun
it’s like apex
if you’re looking for a good shooter i highly recommend titanfall 2
rough shit
you reinstalled apex?
Yeah, it happens
age hasn't made it less funny i think
i know
talking about aggressive marketing reminded me of this
Yeah, for sure
spellbreak just moved to the epic games store
that's for sure
it's a big dick business strategy
i mean
yeah
they’re trying to brute force themselves onto the market and it aint cool
kms
missed a primo chance to start slamming all the lyrics to X gon give it to ya in all caps
i really ought to check in on this shit more
Scrubs
(yes)
from yesterday is making shit pop up on my comp
your fucking poll
 but the story is good enough that yeah you should still play them all
pretty sure exodus has a new set of characters 
Thanks for understanding
One of us
like me
he’s got viewers, but there’s nothing to view for months on end so they just stop caring
so hes broke
on youtube 
sky doesn’t make videos
Verily.
Fair enough.
Well, now you know
crashes every 4 mins
and game doesn’t work
adding friends is dogshit
that might be worth looking at.
i didn't know you could climb in apex legends

wow you can actually just whiff scissors in neutral and use it as a kara cancel into paper on reaction this is crazy


the comments are even better
wait
not gonna point out how i definitely lost points for losing rps, cause im sly as fuck like that.
net neutral overall
but winning rps is a point gain
lying to your friends is a point loss.
you said you were a scissors main you cuck
need nerf
gay
fuck
scissors.
David i think you earned a massive amount of points with that gem there.
jesus fucking christ
just visualize the nerfs in an actual game
upon detailed inspection it's actually an elder god tier meme
it gets better every time you look at it
once again david strikes back with those consistenly clean memes. to this day, no idea how you do it.
Thank you!
and if nothing else we humans are just little machines for the companies above us to advertise through 
cause those things are the shit
yes that was subtle product placement for the lemon pellegrinos
it’s a good place to write, especially if you get this table
so today i got the fuck out and am hanging out in the barnes and noble at the grove.
my aunt invited cousins over from boston to my house, and i forgot until like sunday
Yeah, they should
theres also my personal favorite, #5 a hole is a hole is a hole
but there are more than three schools of thot that govern the world
idk why autocorrect made that plural
3 is the correct opinion
3 is the correct opinion
the female disorder is a rough one
both
i wouldn’t expect anything less from a proper man such as yourself michael
with all due respect, of course 
make sure to slap the shit outta that bitch for being late
are my fellow brothers respecting women?
how all yall nerdy negusi spending valentines day?
Gracias
it's
im sure it not fun for anyone else
its really just fun to be the kirby in that scenario
is kirby after eating krool
only thing more the shit than krool
though krool is still the shit
rip krool
yeah
thats too much
no way man
i'll be happy
if they made his forward air a few frames faster in compensation
he was in a good spot
fuck the gordo nerf
i see
and dedede is king of the stage
they made her downspecial playable
those are squad
but i main zelda and dedede
it's an incredibly good meme
i like that plant is op
yeah
but
you can try to predict it
yep
that shit's telegraphed as fuck but you still get hit by it
and the down special
it's the best move in the game
easily
i suppose
i was gonna say stupid good
piranha plants neutral air is
ez game
you can jump around with fuckin dedede and only neutral air and up tilt and win
there isn't a character where you can't just goon in with neutral air
but neutral air is how you win with every character
neutral air thought so
lmao
how do you play ridley?
he's also terrible
ridley is thug as fuck
highest damage at the longest range, best edge guarding, best recovery
best character in the game
just play piranha plant
so he still gets outshined
yeah but chrom is better roy
is fucking hilarious
which
he's mostly iconic cause smash
roy was ass
lul
the story would have been fine
if i could have been anyone other than corrin
you're right
you know
cause they fucking nailed the difficulty
i mean, you're right though, the gameplay for conquest was great
unless all the characters were grade A idiots
where none of that shit could happen
its one of those stories
and it's still trash
conquest was the not weeby one
no
fates?
although the whole matchmaking part of fire emblem is gonna be REALLY weird
im just talking in comparison to fates
like there's a chance that they could make something half decent
i mean the story isn't fucked from the get go
it's gonna be really fucking anime too
it's
not bullshit
yeah i thought they'd keep it simple and like
wtf is this
y e a h
it's fire emblem highschool man
idk
i.
i just watched it
did you see the nintendo direct about fire emblem?
milo
wait
much worse to watch
apex is boring to play in comparison
im still so salty
the difference is so huge
dude even just watching apex gameplay vs titanfall gameplay
Oh okay, then
each of these skype conversations are unique and masterful works of art
wow
(tongueout)
You know what?
Well, now you know
Haha, you already know
Haha, it's true
Hehe
That's what I thought
Oh okay, then
I said so
What's your name?
I am glad you are
I am glad too
I am blushing
Haha, you are welcome
Haha, no problem
Haha, you are welcome
Haha, no problem
Haha, you are welcome
Haha, no problem
Haha, you are welcome
Haha, no problem
Haha, you are welcome
i thought you weren't making a fortnite reference
i got fucking baited by that one david
i want to kill myself
Haha, fair enough
got stumped
i love that skype fucking
Huh?
Why do you ask?
No problem!
Cheers!
Excellent!
its more fun
disrespect&gt;winning
of which there are a lot of
that's from people who didn't play titanfall
and kill them
cause you can grab people with it
not when they're the grappling hook
rip
good man
you just shot your gun
huh
with just random people?
nice
still, fuck that game, game sucks.
but you get less freedom of movement
for the same reason really
wraith is also pretty good
that's how you win
just pick pathfinder, learn how to control the grappling hook and slingshot, then just run around and flank for big brain plays
but it feels like ass
well you can
you can't play titanfall without an fov that's 90 or higher
it helps
also scale the fov way up
oh
and you have to play through that shit
normally it looks like someone slapped one of those sheets full of tiny holes on top of your monitor
wtf
tis' unplayable
that's how most newer games end up on my comp
right?
it just looked like shit cause you had to turn the rendering down
and now it's playable?
once you learn how to slingshot yourself on your grappling hook it's like a whole new world
it was the same for titanfall
it absolutely changes the game
you gotta learn the grappling hook mechanics
if you play it
nvm my comp has like 2
oh Vram
it'll be like 50 bucks for 2 4 gb sticks\
you can just add more cant you?
but i always splurge on ram
even i have 8 in this shit comp
oof
but it could have been a better game by not being a battle royale and instead being fucking titanfall 3
it's probably the best battle royale out rn
im not saying its bad
the sprites made the game playable
fucking kniferangs and ground harnesses
are aussie greentexts
i think my favorite greentexts
easy
uhh
sounds
Did you win?
that game looks fucking sick
also its gonna be irrelevant once spellbreak comes out
cause its not titanfall 3
fuck that game
i think i'll need to consult the board to evaluate that opinion, parsa
popularity doesn't equate to quality
that's because battle royales are flavor of the season these days
there was an interview in which they said they weren't working on titanfall 3
apex is titanfall for cucks
Oh okay, then
What do you know?
I guess so
I guess you are
Yes, quite.
Indubitably.
Repeatedly.
Ever.
Never too late
lmao
Skype auto-response is what gets me through the day.
(yes)
I think you know
You better be
Haha, I guess so
Haha, fair enough
Yeah, it would
That would be fun
Do not worry about it.
Correct.
What are you doing?
I am happy too
I am happy too
I am happy too
I am glad you are
You are very welcome
Apology accepted.
I was agreeing with you
And why?
Oh hi
I live here
Are you still around?
I am online now
One of us
Huzzah!
Hooray!
Hooray!
That's the spirit!
You should get one
What's yours?
My pleasure!
No problem, enjoy!
Delivered.
i agree
memes are fine as long as the memes shared contain correct opinions.
memes are fine as long as the memes shared contain correct opinions.
fuck
this is a perfectly valid meme.
like this one
thanks.
wow i'm too stupid to verify that opinion, david actually found a loophole
The best kind of correct.
im gonna run with this for as long as i can because it's an exceptionally milkable joke and i have no problems going for low hanging fruit
but...
i was gonna try to do some shit with italics to make it even dumber
now that is a correct opinion
wo
now, _that
and i don't want you to get the dogs, my man.
or at least a question mark, cause you might accidentally state an improper opinion that way 
parsa, you're really walking on thin ice here.
I'll take looking like a bitch in order to frame that correctly
Are you framing that as a question or as a statement?
Are you framing that as a question or as a statement?
but the title of the group chat doesn't say America, it says The Correct Opinion Zone.
i'd agree that that opinion is correct
good luck parsa
because we have no room for incorrect opinions in The Correct Opinion Zone
by dogs.
if you think something different and state that opinion you'll be excommunicated and summarily killed.
correct
so you can't do it.
if you edit that sentence to add a space between "to" and "The" there you'll look like a bitch now.
eat shit
cause that means you're bad at autochess
you should be sad for getting cucked by megacreeps round 3
it is.
well now you're voluntarily giving me ammunition for the gun that i'm gonna flame you with
lucky for you i don't know what that means
so
i don't play auto chess
brain cells bad. self-awareness make depression
lost enough brain cells yet?
but also good
league gay
fortnite for gay faggy kids
fortnite gay
lootbox bad
ea hitler
apex rly good game ook
okok
at least as a mechanic on it's own
one big point in favor of apex is that the grappling hook still works the same
if it was a paid game i'd have issues with the lootboxes, but it's not paid
its also a free game
loot boxes are just cosmetics
you don't need to buy the lootboxes to win the game
it is good
ea being hitler has nothing to do with respawn making the decision to get bought out by them
nah i think respawn is at fault for apex
game's been taken down now.
ah sorry, preordered.
idk, still kinda scummy
if you preorder metro exodus on steam you can play it through steam apparently
rip metro
im just saying titanfall was the best like arcade-y, non-tactical fps out there, and respawn decided to take all the fucking things that raised the skill ceiling and allowed for people to make crazy brain-melting aerial maneuvers while gunning down rows of pre-teens and replaced them with shitty imitations of those things so they can relate their cash grab battle royale game to titanfall and appease their current fans.
if they were fucking steam or something
older games, but subnautica, super meat boy, and axiom verge are all quality games that they could probably have made actual money off of
it's the most idiotic shit
you know they're releasing games for free like weekly just to get people to come onto their platform
yeah epic games is a shitshow
yeah that's why titanfall 3 is gonna take fucking forever
blackout got people who hate call of duty playing call of duty because it's a battle royale
im unhappy
i played both
yeah
it's titanfall for cucks
but there's no double jump, slide hopping got destroyed, cause the boost from sliding is so miniscule and doesn't refresh off of multiple jumps, no wall running, and base walk and run speed is much slower.
like if it had all the titanfall mechanics i'd be with it
it's just that apex legends is lame in pretty much every way when you compare it to titanfall
he's not wrong
but now people can just complain about it after it's released
yeah
which is so fucking bitchmade
but they just didn't disclose that they weren't so they wouldn't have to face backlash from the fans
nobody fuckin asked for apex
they could have just made titanfall 3
but titanfall is better
so yeah
that meme is kinda depressing
lmao
okay
thats like 300 messages 
what the fuck
traps are gay cause penis between legs
this is incorrect 
fuck man
stomach pumped
nvm this is a good video
he have a controller when it's being played on pc
does
why
ok
fortnite?
...
probably 
just going by the demo they showed, their animators have got a lot of work to do to, cause rn enemies look like shit
have you seen gameplay footage of exodus?
not a single one below a 8/10
these are good ass memes
and shaggy
thank fuck
oh ok
is that league now?
is that mid nid with exhaust?
eric uninstalled league?
so many messages 
holy fucking shit
nice
just don't like that one
just messin the foo fighters got some good shit
im a nigger i like to throw shit around and cripwalk everywhere without making anything of myself because i've been horribly crippled by the system so i don't have to take responsibility for my choices
fuck the foo fighters and fuck ur room
and these days succ
i looked it up
i don't even know that song
lol
he's a cool guy
these days
which is pretty rare
amine is a good rapper
holy shit lmao
it’s the BIG YOSHI
also dunkey’s return to the basics makes me so happy
sometimes we still iz kangs n shiet
yall nignogs ever be waiting for the subway or the bus and it comes and the door stops right in front of you?
[1548463156] Milo Amoore: 
What I wouldn't give to have "those" places back. The favorite places of mine I showed you that I can't walk into without being assaulted by the bitter loneliness of memory. Restaurants I loved that I took you to are no more than graveyards for our love that I can no longer bear to visit. My soul resides in these places, and I'm sure you're taking another to them with high spirits and smiles while I lay in the catacomb that once was a home.

&lt;&lt;&lt; where the fuck you find this shit my man?
he ain't a poet but like fuck it
im not gonna roast this guy for doing what he likes
actually
which, on it's own isn't bad, but combined with the lyrics
that song sounds like it was made in garage band
uh
holy shit
this is the bigger flex
died there
i fuckin
"my safeword is pineapple juice"
"my safeword is pineapple juice"
that bitch stole that song from sky billiams
lmfao
wtf
Yes it would
MLK died so we could be morose and lugubrious.
same?
Yet.
i love it

Work gay
Thanks again!
Gotcha
Any nickname?
yep

even though jojo
fighting gold makes jojo look way the fuck more serious than it actually is
till rockstar cucked it
was
campaign when?
cause
is everyone not in class tonight?
good work boys, well meme’d
I am definitely not
I am just curious
Good guess

#1 king k bool main here
im top smash player
i dropped fighterz too
t r u e
which is funny
i think he dropped fighterz for rainbow six siege for the most part
aight
o o f
ok so real talk am i going to santa monica rn or to downtown to see it w/ my boy jonah
they’d have to change the name to miles blackman if it was you
0/10 completely un-immersive
miles morales is a good character though, so its not all that unexpected 
is black/mexican, isnt in a gang
yea
even though he’s bootleg peter parker
you saw it?
hopefully it doesn’t mean that
and im gonna see that fuckin movie even if it means going alone
well i got today and tomorrow free
ik eric does too cause he asked about it
anyone tryna see into the spider verse?
oh shit
and you have your last final today?
nice
when do you niggas get here?
Legendary
eat rocks
is that after the last season of the show comes out and is a complete trainwreck, all the authors who might have wanted to finish it will be scared off. and it will either never be finished, or some complete retard dumbass will pick it up and write something even worse than the show finale.
what'll probably happen
that's good
i can't even begin to start reading it, cause it's so fuckin stupidly long.
wheel of time is too fucking long
it'll probably end up being brandon sanderson too
lul
a much better writer
rothfuss is also
yeah
grrm is slow as fuck though.
most writers aint that fast
since fuckin brandon sanderson writes like he's been huffing cocaine to stay awake for 5 years
you're coming from a bit of a bias there
that said
*story
and not really with the books
that's an issue with the writer though
and a 7 year cliffhanger is fucking ridiculous.
the bigger problem is that it's been like a little over 7 years since DwD was published.
the end of the book and the end of the story are two different things
well
and because the writers aren’t actually good writers, the show went to shit
sorta
after season 4 they went past the book material 
yeah i guess it wouldn’t be as bad if we didn’t have to wait a week between each shit tier episode
oh
not waiting for episodes?
and be done in time for next season
you can probably watch it
no one more season
y e p
it was awful too
Oh i remember the end of season 7 was a monologue 
7 was just dogshit then
6 ending was lit
oh nvm
was season 7 end the one where the building got nuked?
hmm
yeah
though season 7 finale was pretty lit
game of thrones has sucked since season 5
and that you don't even have control over your arms or legs.
better safe than realizing that the shadow people have been talking to you all your life.
that sounds like asking for a bad trip
idk bout drinking while on 3.5 grams
You will
yeah like that
that's black/mexican women all the time though
oh yeah
as rare as you think.
not
and then 8 months later you find out it's someone else's
thots are the type that will show up unannounced at your job and make a scene about them being pregnant with your kid.
thots are fake women
and her dad and brother beat her and make her sleep in the shit ditch.
more likely she goes back home to inda
but is apparently the fault of all american men
that'll never happen
one of those crazy things
This is true
she looks like she shat in the street at some point in her life.
hotter than mia khalifa
they're reallllly really hot.
unless
Y U P
we can swap
100% personal.
it is
are gross
eat dead things
maggot women
black women more like
indian women dog human
no thats indian women
nothing would change.
nothing would change.
and not when.
thats why you say if
come back as a gila monster
and if reincarnation is a thing i definitely don't want to come back.
but i don't want to live forever
if it's a good computer simulation maybe
up until that point
would have been fun though
good times.
cocaine, weed, and a bunch of people fucking outdoors.
70s was all fuckin
Dad?
What's the difference?
same
holy shit
*70
no need for blues in the 70
yeah definitely
that's what you mean
oh
but black people can also just
 eh i guess it's about the economy
this is a huge generalization though
rap songs are about sex with references to selling drugs or taking part in gang shit
disco songs are mostly about dancing, with a bunch of references to sex.
well the content in the songs is different too
disco was better
ik
and it's the same exact thing.
just replace disco with rap.
i mean it hasn't changed really
*money
and instead focuses on being funny and making miney
everybody hates chris just doesn't focus on how shitty black culture is
it's not a bad reference point
and then they dip before they start getting controlled by a dumb thotty white bitch who caught onto the game.
and then fuck them
black guys use their natural bigger dicks to woo dumb thotty white women
and black men are even dumber than black women and all they really want is to put their dicks into as many holes as they can.
and because black women need to control black men
its true
so they can't do that.
it's just that most of them aren't that smart
with their vaginas
black women are taught that in order to get what they want they need to find a man and control him
yeah but you're not in a relationship
it's part of black childhood
no skinny ones have it in them too
cause they're loud, they smell bad, and they're all taught to be stubborn and pissed and obnoxious.
everything is better than black women
black women are the worst
dude
that ones pretty obvious
the black lady is though
these women aint that autistic
gotta see if publishers don't fuck it in the ass
yeah
looks better though
since it's not a neuclear fallout
no.
well.
Read the title.
dmx is big dumb
That's what I thought
it wasn’t me
that was michael
league gay
What was it?
i don’t even remember opening my phone at 4
why’d i send a yeah i guess right there?
why’d i send a yeah i guess right there?
wtf
Yeah I guess
r e t a r d e d
WTF IS THAT SHIT?
YOU CAN'T PICK WHERE YOU PUT YOUR CARDS
ALSO
i don't like either game
is axe good?
ik
a videogame that you spent money to buy
fourteen dollars for a single videogame card
legs?
lul
actually nvm i can't think of a scenario in which that's not completely stupid and needs to be gutted.
but uh
like off camera
or on ledge
like above stage?
what sort of offstage?
UHHHHHHHHHH
only if you sweet spot it though, right?
LOL
*roy
cause chrom looks like a man, wheras chroy looks like a girl boy
i completely disagree
chrom's sick
roy gay
ok
OH
wot
side b and neutral b are marth core imo
yep just marth
was it side b?
what was different with roy?
roy is marth
so he's marth
or is he just marth?
is chrom just ike?
thats retarded
*swap character
can't swapcharacter?
were you taking latino studies?
why
Oh, gotcha.
my comp is so shit, spamming paste lags that shit
wow
LEAGUE
LEAGUELEAGUELEAGUELEAGUELEAGUELEAGUE

LEAGUE
v
LEAGUE
LEAGUE
that are just a pair of small smiles and a pair of large ones
i have 4 options for auto response
why do
Hehe
What's your name?
worth a try
that's a point in its favor
so
i can run smash
that's good then
they're just not top tier
also the graphics aren't awful
yep
i could run tekken on my shitty computer
if
i'd prob get tekken before smash
maybe
maybe i'd get it
if all of smash's music was done by carpenter brut
see
ahh
are you ok michael?
honestly i don't think imma buy it.
ah
is smash out?
i didn't know
milo.
wow.
lol
or wait no other way around
but support midlaners
it's coming back
monkaHMMMMM
i soft quit league for half the year man
yeah
yeah but the fact that that was meta is bad enough
and overwatch season 1 was the worst thing ever
you watch hearthstone through individual games. if those are bad. game is bad.
you play hearthstone through individual games
yeah but
that's what they should do
cause
is renting it out not an option or something?
lmao
just hold it
that’s stupid 
lul
(y)
but the fact that it looks like it has the potential will make all the retards buy it
it won’t 
that one looks like it has potential to be good
sell after anthem then
cause its call of duty
ther’ll be another one next year though
i know that
well yea
oh rip
they’ve got cod, battlefield, anthem, destiny 3
then sell
and wait for the next couple games to come out
you buy now
actually 
maybe they’ll get their shit together 
thats good news tbh
eks dee
in one year
sold too many dumpster fires
that they can literally sell a dumpster fire and turn an immeasurable profit
activision has so many subsidiary companies with so many mindless fans
better off just selling and putting that stock into Activision tbh 
mostly cause smash player base isn’t massive
is not massive 
the problem is that smash’s player base that would pay $25 f
or first day dlc
both are known things
or the dlc characters?
the online is paid now?
thats worse than ea
thats gross
and online will be paid
they’ll do dlc smash characters 
not as much as new games
and make so much money
just start remastering old shit
they could honestly
its just gonna go down more, with the new pokemon being shit
rip
oof
like tonight.
would you turn a profit if you sold right now?
like blizzard
pot stock in other things
just sell
buying nintendo stock has never been a good idea
but
i guess
do you want them to do that?
but that would be shitty
they probably are
yea but thats what the argument is about
who here gives a fuck about fifa?
and i don’t have to care
but i dont have to buy it
yeah
i dont argue for other prople
to me
your point is ridiculous and stupid
so we’ll go play something else
smash bros won’t matter anymore
when sakurai dies
but the point is
apple hasnt made anything since he died
*died
considering that apple hasn’t made a new idea since steve jobs dies
its not a bad point though
thats not what conversation is about
but
yeah
feels fuckin bad man
until micro transactions 
pocket god was good though 
and the guys who made stardew valley
like the guys who made owl boy
or they’ll be one hit wonders
thats not a change
even 5 years ago
even today
big AAA studios dont make good games
so
but you were just saying they wont exist
ok
skype sabotaging me
l m a o
*games
and they’ll make ganes
I am too good
but there will still be companies that want to make good games
and people are too dumb to not spend money on it
mobile games are the future 
it will
no eric you just made yourself sound stupid
this conversation would be irrelevant by then
yeah but
rn
clearly you’re wrong
so
smash 4 with better mechanics and more balanced characters 
[1544078656] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: they should just be making a better, deeper smash

&lt;&lt;&lt; this is what smash ultimate is
except
which is what 60% of smash fans, and 100% of the smash comp scene wants
they should just be making a better, deeper smash
they don’t need to make a smash with a comp scene
nintendo has literally all the money they could possibly need
nintendo has money
this isnt what the point is
but
okay
dude wtf
just a regular duty
its not a moral duty
i disagree
big game companies exist to make money
nah game companies exist to make games
off of esports
yeah if you want to make money
and it makes me unhappy 
yes
and overwatch sucks giant shlong
and the next most popular competitive game scene is overwatch
and league is a bad game
but hearthstone is a bad game
in that your points are correct
i agree with you to some degree
actually interesting 
not like
it makes it interesting on the surface level
if hearthstone is any indication 
but apparently that’s what people like to see
items are stupid brainless rng
nvm
actually items might fix that
yeah but items won’t fix that
the problem with most fighting games that smash doesn’t really have yet is that they’re mostly solved games
soooooooo
4 had shitty mechanics and a large, terribly balanced roster
brawl trash
melee had great mechanics but a tiny and ridiculously unbalanced roster
smash has been great as a competitive game 
not that
how would items make comp more competitive?
items introduce a ton of shitty rng
good shit eric
l u l
yikers
...
that's some real shit right there
put it on watermelon sour patch
acid cheap
cause internal high &gt; external high
shrooms
i'd volunteer my place if it wasn't so cancer

bgm gave me cancer tho
slacks is great

u tryna absolve some faces
memelo
oi
isnt fantano an autist tho?
i didn’t watch video
What did he say?
canadian white girls are just as thotty
go for french canadian white girls
she wants jordan peterson to say he’s a feminist 
same with shapiro but unlike shapiro, he’s not a mass muder killing machine
jordan peterson generally gets hard attacked in most of his interviews
thats cause he’s old
but he’s a dick for a reason
he is
wo
why u hate jordan peterson?
thats something worth celebrating 
wow
Cue
fuckin said the joke i was gonna say
WOW
so its less like so
work starts in 15 mins
but
yes
the boys from solitary confinement would win ez pz
4 team battle royale?
LOL
What's stopping you?
and let em at it
just tell everyone in the prisons that the last man left standing inside gets to go free
cheapest and easiest too
also gladiator fight to the death is the best idea
what was the wait mars question? if you remember it
last night
i shlept af
same
i personally don’t feel that way about streaming and video games
i rescind my statement 
arright you raise a good point
yea
streamers dont need the money
somewhere else
that said he should be donating it to
but this video is cancer
ok thats less degenerate 
50k is a lot
he gets paid to donate a shitton of money to randos
does he make videos of him donating money to streamers?
is the most retarded scumbag shit i’ve ever seen
yeah but to use someone’s fame to make a couple quick bucks in THIS way?
ofc he is he’s getting paid for saying piewdiepie’s name
that kinda fag
mr beast
what kinda fag would make this?
why does this exist
l m a o
yea
when you join it
use your gail voice
no
no
omg
yeah
&gt;.&gt;
all teen videos on pornhub are 18+
thats 2 years after you’re 18
cause then fucking 18 year olds is weird
no i’d say like 30
?
uh
cause they’re funny
nah ben shapiro memes should be a thing
i didn’t think you were authoritarian, but not hard lefties. considering how much you rag on em
yall niggas liberal af tho
its a great time
don’t you love it when someone prefaces their dickish comment with “not to be a dick”
yea ik
they didn’t do this rigged af test
cause
but you’ve gotta take the famous peoples scores with a bit of salt
be like a dick or anything 
not to
so i had to agree or disagree to a lot of shit that i don’t have an opinion on
because there wasn’t a i don’t care button
that that test is rigged
i do think
Economic Left/Right: -0.88 
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -2.51
ds3 looks and plays like a good game
and
cause ds2 looks and plays like a trash heap
but it's not that hard to imagine.
i didn't know it
rather than the vagina

cause the focus
bbc porn is gay
LOL
?
that's gay
finger
elbow?
league?
good point
ah
the point is to nut as much as possible 
why would you take premature ejaculation pills for ddc
he said bbc porn
answer still applies though
bbc not bbw
wait you said
cause it’s nasty 
but that’s ridiculous 
i was gonna try going for 30
yup

troll potential is through the roof
i found an afk dude so im taking him from the south end of the map to the north
you can hogtie players and just kidnap them
omg
ive never felt so african american
and you apparently can’t spawn a new horse when yours gets stolen
so i killed him 10 times and then took his horse and ran
some dude randomly killed me
and just fuck around 
u make a character 
nah its like gta online
its the best

oh is aatrox finally a champion after three years?
oh is cho gath too tanky? lets nerf his damage potential, but make sure he can continue to be tanky as fuck
maybe, but there’s certainly not a problem with that’ lets just nerf his range and his damage to towers so he can’t do anything 
oh is azir’s damage too high?
i love riot’s balance philosophy 
lmao they just gutted everything about him
ya boy retarded
wtf lmao

"It’s always been a fairly straightforward compact when it comes to hip-hop: If you’re a white person eating off what has historically been black culture, you have a certain obligation to repay that creative debt. Eminem continues to attack the hypocrisies and contradictions that allowed him to leapfrog equally gifted artists. Macklemore may have lacked subtlety or a rudimentary understanding of when to share text messages, but there was no questioning his dedication to confront his white privilege."

the difference between post malone and eminem, is that eminem can fucking rap
this is bullshit though
like damn
The most popular young artist in the most unpopular young nation is a rhinestone cowboy who looks like he crawled out of a primordial swamp of nacho cheese. Post Malone is a Halloween rental, a removable platinum grill, a Cubic Zirconium proposal on the jumbo screen of a last-place team.
there are some good ass roasts tho
cause he is a shitty rapper
fuckin
rather than insulthing him for being a shitty rapper
trying to insult post for not being political

i almost did it in eric’s campaign last week
cause fuck it
so i decided to run it down next game
my mf inted first game and i lost before i even had a chance
so it should be ezpz
qt's a boosted animal
yea man
but i don't give a fucking fuck
it's probably impossible

fuck me man
actually a lot of retards did
also what the fuck
it's the first fucking comment
no
and some riot cuck said "yeah i'll make that happen"
but this retard was like "oh but nothing stands out and i need my glowy shit"
it used to be just like the video with nothing but the glasses glowing
i just found out that some retard in league's comments made k/da evelynn look like shit
wait
l a m e
were they good skins?
worlds pass
ew
but the tattoo is cool
she probably has super aids and omega herpes
im not talking about the woman i’m talking about the tattoo
like if it was on her back instead of her vag i think it’d be cooler
regardless of the hentainess of that tatoo, the one on the right is still fucking cool as shit
i can do early sat next week but can’t be sure i’ll always be able to make it
yeah
cause falling out of god’s favor and all that
as you’d lose access to your spells and shit
actually going from LG to LE might completely fuck you eric
had it coming
older game
not overgrowth, lugaru
that rabbit fighting game is a ballsack with toothpick wheels
that rabbit fighting game is a ballsack with toothpick wheels
yea cause shitty ratings are skewed by retards
i didnt get any of those
thats a roughie
oof
i think it's safe to execute that nigger
ew
wtf
eve is def the best
this will be you
or else
dont burn and die parsa
oof
and not whatever beta cuck shit parsa posted
that was about the skyrim video i guess
all these messages
i just loaded
wtf
but haven’t watched it
i’ve had that in my recommend list for like a week
u h
wo
What are you doing there?
except the fucking 8 ft tall space marines monsters with 2 hearts running around with their dicks swinging in the air are much, much more terrifying
there's like zero difference
why don't they just run around naked?
they have all this shit
it just looks so dumb man
this is props to the book
ik i won't in this scenereo
and pizza feet
you can't even move in it unless you're juiced to shit on the most unhol-i mean HOLIEST OF STEROIDIAN CONCOCTIONS.
so fucking big dude
it's
cause
when it comes to marines
my only problem with 30k is the human armor design
maybe
i'll raise em right back
you can raise the stakes on me if you want
i gotta read horus heresy

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
[1541635917] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: apologies fellas

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
i'll let you guys know
when i nut, and i will fall eventually
which is the first of four times you have now asked this question that i have already answered
which is the first of four times you have now asked this question that i have already answered

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
in response to
this is a yes
[1541655938] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: that train shit was a meme

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
[1541655931] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: oh yea

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
wether or not the penalties are nullified if both players lose
and i don't feel like answering four times
but you ask everything like four times
i answered it before you asked 
yeah i did
if you nut you're a lil bitch
thems the breaks
thats it
yeah
lifestyle
it's a fuckin
it's not a competition
nananan
those should be the nnn rules
real men accept the consequences of their actions
if you lose you do the penalty, thats it.
that's a fucking gay rule
if both participants lose, neither has to do the penalty?
wait
which is a huge missed opportunity imo
that literally never got better?
her shitty sentence structure
the same voice tho
they have
that train shit was a meme
oh yea
remember when sadboi music used to fucking slap
oof
this one too
that meme hurts the soul
damn david
i lost nnn on the train home from usc today
apologies fellas
yup
nope
cmon
and they’re all gay
they’re all fake

that dude at riot would be a true homie
yup
no homo
if two dudes tried to eat eachothther out it wouldn’t be all that cool
and women can just eat eachother out and its cool 
thats why men have to say no homo all the time
men are gay
traps are gay
penises are gay
traps have penises
thats the right response 
lul

Inconceivable!

wtf
oh it was definitely the standing at the street corner and staring
Indeed it was
good times
a lot of little kids hiding behind their parents
so far i’ve gotten 60% weird stares 30% oh shit’s and 10% that’s sick, bro’s
pics or its fake
time to go fuck up some kids
it really do be like that sometimes 
shit man
and everything else has shitty features
but youtube is big gay
ikr
also if not spotify, then what? soundcloud? (soundcloud is the only other answer. say yes)
which is a very good game btw yall should try it and leave a thumbs up on steam xd
why do you think i haven’t stopped talking about absolver?
i aint ashamed of the shit i like
i spam my music specifically because i know people will hate it
cause u bois are too pusi
guaranteed 0/11 of you will listen to these spooks
some spook tunes for halloween
was hard as fuck back then cause my hands were tiny
wait that cartoon network game was the shit
get fucking ready fuckers
oh god this one's gonna be depressing
darker
except
yea
pretty sure it's a sequel to undertale
it's free
aren't you guys happy i know about this shit
new toby fox game just came out
we're a bad team cause despite the fact that we don't vehemently hate eachother, we all vehemently hate eachother and would rather int than win
oh yeah mister krabs
oh yeah
mister krabs
lmao
its just that some people are more garbage than others
pretty sure everyones garbage save for challenger
lmao
oof
you just wanted to beat francisco?
lmao?
so because it’s difficult, if the enemy isnt in the right spot, you can start a corner combo?
ic
thats a backwards n
man rite aids hiring real degenerates these days
you dont get to corner combo?
weird
one hit kills in corner is
oh forgot about sparking
i see
naw i mean moves dont do enough damage
time to kill is too long, too imo
defense is complete cancer
dragonball is stylish as hell and very flashy and cool, but only on offense. 
yea
most fighters punish button mashing hard
and it doesn’t punish button mashing. also gay
which is gay
but dragonball only has like block and dodge for defense
it’ll make your reactions better
mechanics are different
maybe?
hmm
which are available to everyone
nobody complains about styles. they complain about powers and the circle dash
if you can land your style you win
either way, the style tiers don’t matter tbh
i get back in 20 mins then 15 mins to walk dogs
okok
yuh
yeah
but khalt’s getting buffed
its now windfall/stagger &gt; forsaken/faejin &gt; khalt
thats pre update
Yep
thats retarded, nobody refers to it like that
wtf
wot?
?
ori in rivals is pretty dope
cough no tiers in absolver cough
cough no tiers in absolver cough
cough since everyone has access to every move cough
that isnt dogshit
not like theres a fighting game out there like that
buuut
in a perfect game there wouldn’t be tiers
i mean
lmao
just nerf bayonetta into the ground and the game would be good imo
l m a o
he should have tbh
the state it was left in is atrocious
Cause sakurai is shit at balancing 
just not as good
it’ll be good dont get me wrong
o o f
and cause nobody will know
probably cause i know it won’t be as good as absolver
idk why im not hyped for smash ultimate 
she did look like an idiot talking to herself
someones streaming herself doing shots at my bar
dont get me wrong, kinda gay is great in comparison to most of the dogshit out there, but its not the new devilman so
story is kinda gay though
castlevania has good animation 
Huzzah!
I concur.
yea it works in real life
oh
and yea you can drift in red dead 2 and its fantastic
the groh player sucks fucking monster cock
i saw that video
which artist?
black klansman was pretty alright though
and yeah spike lee is a nigger
youd only be big gay if you fucked 2+guys at the same time
no you’d be regular gay
and that 10 guy shit only applies in high school
idk, if a man sleeps with 10 dudes i’d call him big gay
apologies 
im the only one who does
i admitted to it
yes
would be rough 
not that she’d be super upset, but that she’d exist 
yes
and deal with my aunt
im not about to make you guys come to k town
yea thats a pretty smart fear
thatd also work
oof yea
for shrooms
honestly it’d probably be safer to just chill in a locked room
is he good?
lmao
KKona
nowhere, most likely
logically where could we go.
yea
wholeheartedly 
i understand that sentiment 
what food you fiending for?
yo miles
thats acid hands down
not the most cost efficient tho
best drug imo
at some point
you should
no
yuh
impossible to enjoy
yea but santa cruz is a 4 and a half hour drive for me
i gotta work thurs morning
nigga im talking about shit thats possible
thatd be dank
tbh i want parsa to say yes
can i get a yea or a nay on shooms?
anyway we hangin out for halloween or nah?
the most apt response would be to slap her
what culture does he appropriate?
thats the dumbest shit ive ever heard
fuck brock cause he culturally appropriates???
wait what
holy shit
yea
yea he would
if i didnt raise my kid?
can’t have that
but then my kid would end up being a nigga
lmao
same
that’d be real bad
now
now
if i had a black kid
yea good point
itd cause problems with the current persona i use in this chat
if i had a gay kid
kms
*anymore
*wont
i wouldnt stick my dick in some low tier thot
that said
yeah exactly 
and if it’s not i’d kill myself
or i’d hang out with it and see if its cool
i’d black pill the thing
oh im free then
18 years later?
oh wait
shoot it
That hard
when your thot has a baby that you know isnt yours and she’s talking the good shit, and you must destroy her.
no harder
knock yourself out
no holding back
really hard
no just.
👌
so it stops
punch it
i’ll bring my gas mask and heater
lmao
id buy
i’d help buy
me neither but it sounds hype
you wont be having school on thurs
if we do shrooms for halloween 
cause
milo do you have school on thurs?
that one was completely my fault
sorr
w h o o p s
consoles are gay unless they’re in your own room
if not idk.
if it does you should get it
red dead might come to pc
james is a cuck
how the fuck you gonna make the only two options brock and james
 we doin shrooms for halloween?
what are us boys doing for halloween
suck dick and die
pc to shit to run
unlike another really good game that i often mention
and its popular so you faglords might play it
red dead 2 is rly fucking good
already got it
lmao
WHEN WE DOIN SHROOMS NIGGAS?
dayum
lol
damb

oof
silver games are easy
no
yes
nearly outta silbur, boys
nearly outta silbur, boys
3 more games
lmfao
its not that loud so u gotta crank that volume up
how about some sadboi music for parsa
oof
especially that what are those girl
and everyone who worked on it should be executed 
and i think all the copies should be burned
black panther was a 1/10 movie
and i’d say its pretty dank
theres one already done for kindred
so stfu and kill yourself eric
theres a read receipt on my message for him
eric
except
full homo
also diego we love ya man
i just had the best thresh game i'll have in a long time, so might as well put that shit away
in an expression of never seen before wisdom, mars speaks stops playing league for the day
is he freaking out again?
yup
compared to american bikes?
jap bikes sound gay tho
but nah. you can control that shit
cause bikes are just loud
i had always assumed it was just bikes being loud
or the rider is a dumbass
well now you know that its either intentional 
did this shit just send wtf
i only bring this up cause some retard just drove past my window with his bike sounding like D-day
which means you’re either an asshole or a fuckin idiot
because if you’re revving you’re engine super loud on a bike in a residential area it means you’re either driving way too fast, or your’re driving in too low a gear and tugging the everloving shit out of your throttle
learning to ride a motorcycle has only made me hate people who ride really loud even more
so
it kills me that i live in a society where cardi fucking b is more popular than noname
i havent heard mary jane love, that songs fuckin lit
okay
oh
don’t remember where tho
actually i’ve seen this one before
lul
whos this?
telefone was a fucking amazing album
yea
imo she’s the only female rapper who can rap well
i always forget to mention her to you
yall niggas ever heard of noname?
ay
were just tryna look out man
so she doesn't file one against you
if she doesn't tell you she's on her period then you drop all contact with her immediately and preemptively file a rape claim against her with your college
get her tested
oh god yeah
still think about that one
in front of an old asian ladyh
yeah
hahaha
ofc i hate them
by existing
well niggers damage my reputation
do you say that like echo?
ekow?
and that theres very little difference between a nigga and a nigga with cerebral palsy
i like that that just looks like a regular nigger
also the blue suede shoes
that's what he did
he fixed his hair
nice
just your opinion
no pictures
rate heather/10
there are nuances to catching coochie
is that game still active?
pokemen go?
or not letting her ride you at all
or not letting her ride you in a moving car
not fucking in a moving car
like
i feel like there's ways you could at least try to prevent that
rip
uh
jett u gonna take that?
that's a roast
oof
feels bad
i haven't talked to jett for a month
jett how you doin man?
oh shit jett's watchin the conversation
it's cause they live so close to all the hentai
asian girls are fuckin weird man
so you don't dirty your dick
just punch her in the pelvis without fucking her
better yet
get it over with.
just fist her and punch her in the cervix
that's fucking rood
lmfao
and that aint me bro
cause that shits a little gay
though im gonna have to offer a prayer of no homo before listening
but the audio for evidence
not yourself obviously
i'd give you 5 bucks to do it, and record it
lmao
more like hua
like one syllable fast
i read it faster tho
oo oo hooa
anything?
i don't think it was
F
i still like hooa
a little too human
i give it a 8/10
cha that's a new one
the old bang bang boom boom ook ook ya ook?
just to watch
that fucking hurt my dick
F
and go from there
all i want to do is tie a bitch up when i fuck her
lmao
we did
cause you have access to both the ass and the tiddy
regular cowgirl's better
ew what the fuck
missionary gay tho
im not a sex god i haven't tried all the positions
dude idk
you would
wiping shit on a girl's forhead doesn't get my rocks off
im not a sadist
jesus no
im not a sadist
jesus no
you wouldn't fuck them with a 20 foot pole
dude black chicks smell like fucking monkeys
im okay with anything that isn't fat, black, mexican or some combination of those three
i've had the traps are gay conversation too many times to not understand
with a feminine penis
he's gotta be feminine
michael does care about looks.
well
don't spam you fucking cocksleeve
id fuck jojo if jojo was kit harrington
LMAO
i think the people you're talking about specifically are closeted gay degenerates
i don't think those closeted gay men don't care about looks
and they want some nice abs to grip while they pound away
the tops are gay too
yes
that's straight guys
they're little women men
yeah they are
because that's literally what attractiveness is for
yeah but as an ugly gay dude, you will get a lot less fuck than you will as an attractive gay dude
FAIR ENOUGH
michael?
source on that?
*chicks
because i don't want to fuck black chick
nope
and eric
being attractive as a gay man only reaaally matters if you're going to be an actor in something, or if you're looking to fuck some guys
it doesn't even matter if you're a gay dude
well no
yes
we've said this 20 times
for men
they don't matter
eric you're confusing me, are you straight or are you gay?
michael
no not u
and then lied
so he was talking shit about both of us
it's geared toward the success of younger women and older men
the world is cruel
men have one less avenue to attract viewers when compared to women
looks aren't important when concerning men
^^^
[1540520894] Michael Bateman-Shirley: jesus fighting over semantics doesn't mean you win the argument

&lt;&lt;&lt; u talkin shit bout me?
sneaky's thicc
its true
lul
heres the thing if he went out and talked to bitches and didn't act like a nerd or a cuck he could fuck the whole world
in his lifetime
i doubt he'll ever get as many followers as poki
nah he's attractive
the yes sent late
not if im not arguing about it
*no
yes
that was the beginning of the conversation
it wasn't an argument though
david you're being stupid
and it wasn't an argument at that point
it wasn't an example
attractiveness trumps all in lower skill ratings
its true
i think we were arguing the same thing the whole time
nvm you're right milo
ok hold up
well clearly you didn't read the whole thing
*incorrect
i think that's incorrec
the whole thing started because milo said it was hard for women to be streamers
that was before it was an argument too
wtf
can i not just state my fuckin opnion?
because i was just stating something
that was never the point
no that wasn't the point either
jesus
its a specific example of a streamer who i don't like with a lot of makeup
it's not an example of a streamer who wears a lot of makeup
to understand
what the fuck is so hard about that
that's why i mentioned it
cause i think she looks worse with makeup
yes
yes
and i think she looks worse for it
she does
there's a separation there
if i was using lily as an example of twitch bitches who wear lots of makeup, i would have said, "all the twitch bitches, like lily."
yes
5-20
ok but how many viewers do most men have?
because milo is correct about the tier list
no you wouldn't
much fewer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^66
than it is as a man
and that it's much easier to become popular on twitch as a woman
im just saying that you don't have to be as good
because im not saying that you can be gutter trash and get millions of viewers
i don't see what you're trying to defend
i wasnt using her as an example
she’d have even less
but if she was milo
definitely not
i personally dont think it’s necessary 
in the service industry 100% do
depends on the job
true david
not
thats
plenty go outside without makeup
mars and a roomfull of retard niggers?
whats the dynamic?
or like 85%
since the viewership is 90% dudes
*matter
it wouldnt mayter
no you could be attractive
that was my point
streaming is easier for women
yes
and milo would get none
poki would get all the followers
at the same skill level as poki
if milo were to stream
but get this
just fuck her organs so she doesnt get preggo
this mans a safe sex champion 
you’re gonna fuck her belly button?
and her hands
and her mouth
dibs on her ass
lmao
and kaylahm is god tier at absolver and i can still whoop her ass
bad
nope
nvm all women suck at videogames
world shook
wtf
remi was trans?
im not sayin poke’s bad
she was fucking awesome
whats her name? the female thresh player in esports a while back?
look at uh
its not like they’re comedians. they’re streamers playing videogames
and they dont try to get good
well they dont try to be funny
anne hathaway looks like an alien tho
trying to get a following as a female without pandering, on twitch which is a platform full of bitches who pander will be impossible because of the competition
there isnt a reasonable alternative because the method they use is unreasonably easy and is unreasonably effective
but just correlation doesn’t equal causality in this case
yes because they’re all doing the same shit
not hard as a female
its hard in general
but she wanted the donations of thirsty retard teens so thats what she gets
but she wanted the donations of thirsty retard teens so thats what she gets
then she wouldn’t have built the expectation of her always wearing makeup and looking like a model
but she shouldn’t have done it in the first place
i know
same with lily and all the other twitch bitches
but i specifically dont like how she looks because she wears too much makeup 
yeah
like an actual human being
she looks better without
before and after
only if we say a quick no homo
uhhhhhhh
uh
i respect those devil spawn thots
ah you right, my apologies.
saw that
*pewds hates women
i like a guy who knows how to dice an onyon
magic man is the shit
b r u h
my argument still stands
which is the edgiest, fucking balls to the wall character in that game
and the tekken character they have is yoshimitsu
@david, kuma's not in soul calibur
ITS 1:54 WHO THE FUCKING SHIT IS YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER
yea
and eve can stop beating around the bush and shove the large rod up her ass
so graves can have his cigar
ban everyone under 17
we gotta ban kids
i forgot kids can play league
oh my god
wtf is that?
exactly 
yes
riot gives me better teams in the morning
both
and from like 9am until 3pm i can win every game
anyway it became very clear to me that i just can’t win league games past like 6pm
yeh imma just stick with absolver 
except a character creator
it has everything you could want
and a retarded cyborg 
and a guy with a jaguar head
you can fight as a bear
cause in tekken
id rather get tekken
soul caliber reminds me too much of those devil may cry edgy fighting games
i don’t think i’d pay more than 20 for it
it sounds alright 
i c
for clarity 
and it shows what moveset you’re using, right?
you don’t get to make the moveset tho do you?
just so you can flush the disk down the toilet
if you cant i’d say buy it
if you can play custom characters online then SC is good
nothing, that little shit’s dead lul
what did xxx get for christmas?
yea post-mortem re-sentencing lol
sorry, was
proof enough that x is a cunt
here we go
ayy
nvm soul caliber is the best fighting game
good chat
and invariably, the first thing i always think is: “what the fuck.”
and once between 6 and 8 pm
once in the morning
i always come check on this group chat like
exactly
lets say you’re fucking bowserette in the ass, but you’re  a real motherfucker, so you decide want her to suck you off now. So you pull your dick out, take one careless step toward her face and bam. Spike in your dick.
okay.
you never know whats gonna happen next
shit gets crazy
yea but man
im not into getting my dick pierced 
its shell also has spikes
but memes dead man
had you asked that 3 weeks ago maybe 
lmfao

Yes there is
key and peele are fucking comedic geniuses
wtf
A b S o L v E r R r R r

fucking retarded
and my hand never touched it
phone button up there
idk how that happens
wtf was that
i didnt even try to call group
cause drake is a fake ass nigga
drake should be paid none of his money

tbh idk of this means i overestimated underestimated modern rap
but a lot of them are good points
some of these guys i dont think have more than 10 songs
maybe
drake is has political songs, same with x
i just wanna hear more memey shit like brutalism
but the new idles album is very politically charged, and it sucks dick because i don’t want to listen to that crap
except i wouldnt listen to it anyway
this
but youre right, post isn’t political from what i’ve seen so far
my point is that modern rap is political and that makes it even more shitty than the lack of thought put into the writing 
liberal
didnt name a rapper yet so my point still stands
[1537755162] David Grothe: How is rap political?

&lt;&lt;&lt; name a rap artist who hasn’t made at least 10 songs that speak out about hardship in america as a person of color/low income/poor social standing.   I don’t know if it’s possible, at least rappers that arent memers. I can only think of Death Grips and they’re barely rap.

Good title
naw man thots want it so they can make big money for all the really fucked up porn
i mean it's technically an injury, just the kind that some nasty thots want to have for some reason
"Booty on the outside" One of the more vulgar lyrics on this track, Ride could be referring to anal prolapse, an injury which can occur during rough anal sex where the bowel can come away from the walls of the rectum, causing it to prolapse out of the anus, leaving ‘the booty on the outside’ of the body, quite literally.Also known as rosebudding as it somewhat resembles a rose coming into bloom.
that's pretty scuffed science imo

Papa John's shares fell nearly 5 percent Wednesday after the report, closing at $48.33
he's
it's no downward spiral
rather than actually putting anything of himself into his music, he's just being as loud and different as possible in order to get people to pay attention to him
kanye is getting better slowly, but like ehhh, coming from him it's like he's grasping at straws to stay relevant
Atrocity exhibition is the fuckin sickest album i've heard since tpab
drake doesn't do anything for his songs.
drake's worse than post malone
but drake's also trash
but death metal wasn't making him any money
and you don't need good lyrics for death metal, cause nobody can hear you anyway.
post malone's lyrics aren't great though because he used to be in a death metal band
he didn't make that beat
first, we've got a piece of hot fucking gold right off death grip's new album
i'll give you a comparison
they're literally the same words that every songwriter past the age of thirteen has written at some point
if you listen to the fuckin words that he's saying
here's the thing about post malone
this shit'll fuck you right up
it's heterosexual

tonight theres some big fuck off party
i do tomorrow 
*security guard
being a fuckin bodyguard for four hours
gonna be at work till 8
i cant come tomorrow 
milo
also
and i’ll int
will do
lul
im nearly there
fuck that nigga
then naw
if i were in the same room with him, and he didnt have a gun, or soldiers to shoot me with
why?
just because you said rip doesnt mean you’re a fan
im just saying cause milo said you liked him
idk
thats an actual self-made opinion on the matter.
thats reason enough for a rip
there we go.
if you like his shit then give him a rip
argument complete
boom
“i liked his shit”
well then why not say
no.
does x deserve it?
politeness and respect are for people who deserve it.
no
but would i say bless you to adolf hitler?
yea
it shouldnt be a thing you say
yeah. but that shit is stupid
im not pretending
that is whats important
nameless people dont matter
i didnt
i dont give a fuck who cared about him
*that
if thats what you mean say thar
thats not what the words mean
that means that your rest in peace has the same value as an “oh”
if you just say shit without any meaning then why say anything at all?
words have meanings to them
but i dont
you can
then sure
tupac level
if he was like
his music was pretty bad man
what did he contribute?
my point is that he isn’t a person who is deserving of a rest in peace. so don’t say it for him.
thats. not a point at all.
ofc it doesn’t matter to him. is that the point you were making?
so it is pretty relevant 
if you believe in souls you generally also believe that your actions in life have some consequence as to whatever happens to that soul
no?
except
and all that life and death shit
he believes in heaven and hell
that nigga is a christian
it depends on what you believe, or more what they believe
i wouldn’t
if he deserves to rest in peace he can have a rest in peace. if he deserves respect he can have respect
that’d be like, “too bad, he died too early.”
also no, saying rest in peace is not a basic respect
so where is squad meeting?
did you read all the charges and shit he had against him from the domestic abuse case?
he was a grade a cunt from day 1
fuck him
i can make 5:30
nvm
so i can prob make 5
also
im out of work and heading home
he was a bitch ass nigga
fuck x
lol

that commercial script is incredible
holy shit
yep
parsa i think you'd like him
and he's a fuckign lunatic
the dude said he was over the series with smash 4
that sakurai picture looks incredibly apt
monkeys arent all that, tho i see them every day
he looks like he’ll split your head like a watermelon
but still, making him swole as fuck is dope
it wasnt less shitty before the change tho
yea
black and red is pretty shitty
bigass lizards?
wow
shit was gay anyway
fuck banner
jumong is a cock hero tho
wowee
battlerite?
like toeing the line just cause it's not racist so you can
b's are safe
if you use the b's you're not racist
b's aren't racist

boi
I saw it
dont fucking pop my bubble
fuck you
but seeing this shit made it worthwhile
i’ve been at work for nearly 8 hours with no break
BOOOOOOOOOOOOYYYYYYY
Kindred W

As a follow up to Kindred's 8.12 buffs we're also potentially returning the Heal on W for 8.13. Change is just going into testing now, so it's not a certain thing yet. Tentative plan is to remove the monster AS slow and replace it with a heal that scales with Kindred's missing health.

While we're working on the W already we're also hitting a couple of notable bugs with it. The first is that some of Wolf's visual effects aren't playing properly when he hits, making the skill less satisfying to use and a bit harder to follow. The second is that Wolf's Attack Speed isn't scaling properly with item purchases.
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
yO WaS tHaT a jOjO ReFeReNcE????
remember POISE?
lol
where every sword is the carthus curved sword?
so a souls like game
sounds like a mother fucking jam.
where the entire game is blighttown?
so a souls like game
that’d be my fuckin jam
someone make me a from soft game with Supergiant behind all the art design and shit
but i dont like the victorian aesthetic too much
then i like
at least up until the nasty fungus aliens start showing up
bloodbourne kinda gay
and each of those releases sold
s e v e n
they released skyrim 7 times
im just saying
and it leads into a remastering of dark souls 3
but its easy money
it was the worst
for little to no work, then why the fuck would you not do it
if you can get money
companies like money
then there’s a massive problem
cause if not, you’ll get a shitty ds2 remaster
and you need to show that to the company by telling them that they fucked up and not playing the game
than there’s a massive problem
which came out like 4 years ago
is worse than ds3
if the ds1 remaster
im putting the niggers in their place
yeah well the wrong people won
its fucking ass
the problem is that a remaster
of course its better
you fucking retards
are you comparing dark souls remastered to its pc release
why the fuck
ok
free mobis from your passive
jg taliyah sounds dank tho
you faggot
and you spam often
because milo spammed
in my name
for the sole purpose of being cancerous
cause jett called intentionally
and it's like 12
REEEEEE
but yea it looks cool
but i dont like turn based combat when its not positioning based :/
a 2d legend of grimrock
the combat is like
it does look sick
rly?
darkest dungeon?
you are?
BASED BONE BOI
SHOVEL SKELETON 
(clap)
MICHAEL YOU FAGGOT REEEEEE
i apologize again
:/
i apologize
kill all white people! black lives matter!
We can not
fuck man
suck dick
that's what jett's about to type
WE're blowing up chat with this shit tho
the story was better when he was fucking felurian and he'd forgot all about the other ho
but yeah the fact that he's always fuckin looking for the bitch is creepy
it was "coincidence"
i mean he didn't stalk her
wouldn't it?
it's an unreliable narrator
he's only been studying arcana for like a year and a half by that time
but they're masters cause they've been at it for a while
but that's explained
which is why i don't mind him being like ridiculously strong in just about every other aspect of his character
he was the baron's best friend
but i don't mind him being a social retard
it's actually surprisingly good
if you're building the same shit every game you're fuckin doing it wrong
there really isn't a right way to build kindred though
i know it's overkill, but i'm a thundercuck that likes to auto people at blue from the river
idk i don't like not building rfc because having less than 725 range at 20 mins is cancer
that's pretty nice
or it didn't work
and last time i checked, the hurricane range didn't scale with her range scaling
she doesn't have any innate on hits
bork isn't bad
you don't do onhit
fucking get rid of the apostrophe on kindred's?
maybe phantom dancer or rfc but not hurricane
nobody builds warrior bork hurricane
bruh
hold the fucking phone
and instead go like, Warrior, stormrazor, BC, and whatever else
so she can afford to build less attack speed and crit
and they buffed her as scaling
reverted nerfs are good
its fine
league is alright
kindred sucks
no
bless up riot games
HOLY SHIT THOSE KINDRED BUFFS ON PBE
streaky
its the month old banger from the new death grips album
STREAKY ON THE OUTSIDE 
holy fuck
fixed it
the fuckin dark souls fiends
who do you think is doing it?
My thoughts exactly.
boys?
it's pretty true
they're supposed to be like
also, yes it's weird that you recognize them
i woulda done it if he coulda given me what i wanted :(
i mean i didn't back out as much as the demon was unable to complete his end of the deal
you're heading there
what the fuck
this one's pretty good
(laugh)
you'll get hit by the full force of that gay shit
it wont miss if you stay
milo get the fuck outta that gay shit
yep
gayla
more like
gala?
dont ever call me a veo again
o o f
whatd you cut yourself on?
and he's still shit
i don't, then
wtf
in pre game?
i cant troll randos anymore?
wait
we’re in this shit together
i got u bro
look at me and try to ignore them
ok ya boi is finally setting off
before i can leave
gimme like another 30 mins
yet
im not
except
I am coming now
ty diego
lettin me know if you decide to go down to the beach or smthin
would you bools do me the honor of
ay since im gonna finna be late
lmfao
yo happy birthday jett
without at least a twenty word explanation
im not touching that
eric you’re gay
team only likes popular games feelsbadman
Diabetes
yes
i'll probably try it sometime
that's a much more expensive pastime than wow is
roll20 best videogame
nobody will get burnt out trust
and cycle through em daily
each make a campaign
or we could
yeah for sure
thats for fucking sure
itd have a lot of players
what the fuck
they the sakura guys
arent
literally not a remastering at all
dark souls remastered is
mb
cause i didnt say that i meant wow
yea it looks like that
i meant wow
oh
tf2 lmfao
my computer can probably rub that shit just finr too
tbh
id be down
gay
dont get me wrong
if wow wasnt subscription based i’d be on it
which is so lame
and thats really the only game we fuckin play together
yeah
in league, the only way you can really quantify your individual skill at the game is through ranked
which is especially easy to do when you go up against the same couple veterans once a week or so
i enjoy seeing myself improve at the game
so you cant justify just trying it out
sadly its not free to play
you probably wouldnt like it then
it depends on what you expect the game to be about
if you had that matchmaking you wouldnt get matches
but the playerbase is small
which is why the devs are making a ranked mode
and 5 of them are single player
i only see you play like 7
which games?
especially the older people
literally anyone in the game will fuckin help you get better
or ask questions after a match
all you gotta do is not be a bitch
they’re bitches
yes
feint the dude out and win a round
when you see someone who’s played for a while, you set smaller goals
but theres a level display at the start of every match that shows how much time someone’s invested into the game
then ofc you’re not gonna have fun
if your goal is to win against someone who’s dismond
only if the game is about winning or losing
i mean
because the core gameplay is fun as fuck
learn from your mistakes
you can play better
its not out of your control
thats very different
are you saying you’re too much of a pussy to lose?
because there arent teams
if league had a 1v1 mode where you could match up against anyone
except its more like
but its an 8 person team
they’re currently making a ranked gamemode
why?
i get matches in less than two seconds oftentimes
or newbies
you match against the really good people
there isnt ranked matchmaking
where everybody who’s stayed is super skillful to the point that it oftentimes drives shitters who are too pussy to get better off
literally the opposite case here
thats
so obviously he grew a conscience and switched back
it was asol
did you look at that loading screen
cause i like milo more than i like those hundred people
i dont give credence to the opinions of a hundred people over, say, milo
i figure one person is more convincing when you know the person
its not hard
i mean i could link you the reddit
thats called selling something
to get you interested
if i want to get you to play it i literally do have to jack it off
? what do you mean dont go jacking it off
even though its dogshit
if that were the case call of duty would be a masterpiece
player base doesnt make a game good
this is why im spreading the word
^
you guys keep playing your shitty games
but w/e
rather than just maining a character or three
and those same people are constantly changing their movesets out of a shit ton of possibilities
especially since its not a standard character fighter
and naw it doesnt get old
ew
and not like an mmo that needs a huge playerbase
since its a 1v1 pvp fighting game
either way its not all that noticable
i see
that shit was gay as fuck
ye man
after atmosphir may it rest in peace
its also got the second best community i’ve seen in a fuckin videogame.
by fuckin miles
better than league
that was true like a few months ago maybe
where are those facts coming from?
at least to learn
easier game than dbz
js
still on sale
absolver is
oof
drake's closet gay
and i don't wanna play league cause they killed kindred
that's fucking awesome
thats so lame
why not wood
and yeah miles you're a fucking nigger
the down point is a grave enough offense without this bullshit added meaning
but thats literally what is
i doubt it works
lmao
the equivalent of steroids for esports???
isnt this like
how the fuck old is your family bruh?
the glasses are so sick, that the devil’ll be like bruh get the fuck outta here, and then i’ll just leave
they’ll probably get me shot and robbed if i wear em in my neighborhood
these shits are gonna carry me to hell and back
ikr
finally found the replacement for my nice ass sunglasses
i fuckin
alright
“do that”
or send them a picture and say
so if you wanted a specific space marine im sure you could just design one with them
my problem is i hate just about everything’s clothing options, cause nobody does cloaks like this one
and they 3d print it
you design it yourself
its custom
its gonna happen
also
you’ve fallen too far
milo fuck you
i will have that statuette
im still looking for a website that does custom miniatures
lul
e a o
from worst to best it goes as follows
o is better than both of those
but like ye
i’ll be a bit late cause i get off work at 5:30 and it takes a long time to get around
i actually think i’ll be able to make that
it's fuckin gay
they're good usually
it's not a quote when you play him
but i see where you're coming from
he's got a quote that says "it's troll time" and he's trundle "the troll king"
that's called
that's a fucking hilarious image
especially when it's over six people whinging about the same thing at the same time
especially when it's over six people whinging about the same thing at the same times
cause i don't want to listen to people whinge
like if they're standing in front of a doorway or something that's when it's too far
that's completely fine
i don't mind silent protests, or like small ones
that wouldn't work in america
that's definitely pretty heavy handed
don't halve my lp gains just cause im toxic
plz don't ban me rito
i don't want to lose points over flaming
so i'm good
i don't talk shit online in forums or anything
then i wouldn't have many points
why don't we just have that
wait that's fucking perfect
cause he's doing some good shit
HOLY FUCK that's so sick
what's that shit?
it's so incredibly gay
and i don't want to put any facet of my life in their hands.
well that's the actual issue
i don't see a problem with having a lot of land and no neighbors
that's why votes should be weighted
if i had a quote book that'd be in it
[5/19/2018 10:01:47 PM] The most wrong you could possibly be: even a broken clock is right twice a day&lt;&lt;&lt;
except normally it's supposed to be about promoting yourself
leftists make baseless claims and repeat them until the news thinks it's true
that's why i said nearly tho
i mean they're all retarded
hard right wingers are nearly as retarded as hard leftists
that's fucking hilarious
i haven't heard that shit
nobody realizes how good we've already got it
they've got fish and chips
so they don't count
but here's the thing
and i'll repeat
there's a coastline in nigeria
(puke)
(puke)
lamb is like the one land animal that i'll eat sweet
they're too poor
and niggers wouldn't know
but like i don't know anyone who isn't like
i'm sure it's passable to like most people
that's a fucking abomination
chicken can't go alone though
it's harder to go wrong with things like beef or chicken though
depends on where it's from and how fresh it is
i don't
i guess i don't count most seafood as "meat"
i just don't like my meat with anything sugary on it
you can't pick out different flavors in the meat itself?
and here's my counter point.
there shouldn't be anything i need to put on my steak to make it taste good
if the steak isn't pre buttered, they aren't doing it right
bro i don't even put sauce on the steak
that's incredibly fucking stupid
that's fucking stupid
personally i don't like to mix sweet and savory tastes
cause that's what amercians think asian food is
cause it's all like pinapple meat and shit
and i don't give bitch niggas my money
look if you had said hells kitchen i'd have said fuck yeah
ok as long as you didn't spend money on them
that's a 0/5
bruh that's gay as fuck
don't even deserve the title of excriment of man's best friend
they're catshit
no that phone is worse than the one you're looking at
they probably just have it so semi-rich fags can eat that shit and pretend they're super rich fags
it's french
idk what's not dank about that
that's dank as fuck
it's literally made
eric's not wrong about that
so i wouldn't know how much space you'll need for that
and that's like once every two months
i don't take many pictures and videos
i'll be honest diego, 
that's very un vegan of you
why didn't you tell us?
phones rly don't need ram
im sure it's cheap as fuck
even that's so much more than you'll ever need in your life ever
but don't get two hundred fucking fifty six gigabytes of space
yeah but that's a bad reason
yeah, but if you do, we'll have a good reason to
and we'll troll u for the rest of your life
this is the dumbest conversation that i've ever taken part of
and it's less than 14 gbs
i've got fucking 12 days worth of music on my phone
that's fucking retarded
that's 128 gigs of storage tho
because they don't have headphone ports
that's more expensive than an actual iphone 6
"waddup?"
"waddup?
hey can you stop by my mom's house
you're what?
i haven't met jeanne
i don't say im good tho
hardstuck d5
back where you belong
R I P
LOL
(ok)
the music matches beat for beat tho
nibbers?
i wanna beat your asses in a videogame that im actually passable at
grab absolver while its hot
bruh
if you see laurel in that picture you're a fucking autist
they don't need their cs
if you dont win you’re trash at league
r i p
and anyone who hears laurel is obviously fucking retarded
yep
ype
then i hear laurel
unless you turn that slider all the way to laurel
yanny
compared to the meta junglers at least
kindred’s still pretty ass
then one with a 2:15 timer
2 scuttles to start with
cause those niggas at riot didnrmt kill kindred
bruh this patch list gave me a mad stiffie
i gotta walk my dogs
those are the trifecta imo
those are the trifecta imp
but that goes without saying
oh, and shoot your goo my dude
are fantastic 
and its her fucking nipple
the cash money one
he's more of like a support/assassin
which isn't too bad in my books
it's about as edgy as like thresh or zed
he's a fuckin pirate ghost
yeah that's true
it's impossible to be edgy when you're bilgewater
also he's bilgewater
Make me
REEEEE
and rocco tbh
mfw that picture is literally my brother lucky
i love seeing those dumb ass monkey ass niggas get arrested for dumb shit
underrated
live pd is a good ass show
the best of those shitty gemstone skins
spoopy vayne
if you're going, good luck
and just becasue it's on top of the ritz you know they're gonna charge you extra on everything just because they can.
idk i wouldn't consider that dude high tier
and im assuming it's less expensive
and you decide wulfgang puck's place is better?
it's just good as fuck
it's not fancy or famous
don't get me wrong
no it's not
fuck people, they're cancer
nvm i wouldn't have said that shit either
parsa's a   p u s s y
parsa didn't say what he got?
empathy is for cucks that dont punch women
suck my dick, faggots
13
i heard it was just alright
the cirqué
that one is an oldie tho
oh yeah
cause adcs can be soloed by anything just about
unless they’re adcs
point and click ranged champs are pretty gay
im playing him jungle, full ad
*though
fuck it thiugh
just thresh
how is he not like
and if he is
how tf is this guy a support
uh
yea milo its usually the same for absolver, except most people want to get their asses beat, cause you get better that way
cause they’re embarassed to lose to a shitty low rank retard
in absolver
cant get good people to rematch me
i fucking
LOL
they do tard rage at you tho
well they dont roast you, since feminists are terrible at roasting
its the thing that makes people think you have a really big pee pee
at least futas have tits
traps are gayer
im with it
that google assistant shit is pretty lit
and if not, i’ll get myself arrested, just so i can fight you and whoop your ass for ez status
prison gangs r ghey
it better be for some shit so fucked up that nobody will cone within 40 feet of you in the first place
if any of you gaylords ends up in prison
thats actually true tho milo, well said
git good
i'll go full fucking ape on him
i want to beat this man's bitch ass face until there's nothing left of it
you're forgetting the periods
he's even my fucking age
i'll fucking wipe this monkey ass nigger off the face of the earth
i'll kill him
the game would have been better if they spent all that time they used porting it to xbox on fixing all it's shitty bugs and optimizing it
i didn't see those changes
if you're fighting mundo and you don't pick up one of those it's your damn fault if you lose
yeah
so theres a bit of an unfair advantage
but he’s as tall as a 12-13 year old
10, going on 11
nah
LOL
rocco’s undefeated this season
im heading to my bro’s basketball game rn
but everyone plays like they’re cross faded and have no eyes
i can usually carry a silver game if one lane doesnt int
:(
league thinks i suck
+22, -19
im at -19
thats some bullshit
 wait you boys are at -15 or 17?
it's fuckin so close nigga
but it'd be better if it cut the bullshit
To show the world that Kim Jong Un's way is the winning way.
I will make them practise 23 hours a day.
I am thinking of creating a league team for North Korea

it's still his fault
why the fuck did jett leave every conversation he's ever taken part in
cause if you turn your brain off and look at the cool superhero shit on the screen it wont matter if the movie is in any way coherent
at worst a 2
so i still think infinity war is gonna be at best a solid 5/10
thats my reasoning for not trusting eric’s taste in movies
cause disney sucks dick
cause disnet sucks dick
nigga
?
yes
thats how sith work
he should be the new ruler at that point
kylo killed snoke
why was that fight even happening
that wasnt good
there were no good parts
its not that its cool to hate it
and you liked the last jedi, eric
you guys liked black panther
but
yes
it's an omegalul, but don't put omegalul as the o in zoe, that shit sound gay when you say it out loud
cause it's so bad :/
kaisa really didn't need all that shit
shit, i don't want that shit
you don't want that shit
that's some nice fuckin lag
as long as they don't mess with it
new vegas remastered is like one of 3 games i'd actually appreciate a remaster of
or new vegas'
i dont like this
the scuttle change sucks ass
rip
 as warwick?
only it'd be like
that's a better name than buddy
you can have my aunt's dog
that's going to the grave with me
and milo, as a nigger, the odds of me having kids before 18 is so high, that it's safer for a nigga to be assumin that there's like 3 or 4 of them out there
..... loves them
nobody....
they’re little shits and
tell them
if you find my kids
theres so much blood
bibbers i just cut my finger on a can of dog food and now im gonna die
Eric
你好
riven fan fiction?
is this
its time to stop, sneaky
i don't want to kill harambe in dnd
what's up fuckers?
?
is it roast time
same with wow
absolver &gt; league in pretty much any scenario 
same
fuck my ass im hypergay
I have to
now i want to kill myself
vrohiyo
since he's 10 fuckin hours late
mfw the first part of my 2 part message doesn't send and i look like a retard
level three is gay as fuck
that's a fucking
jett if i was admin of this chat you'd have been kicked rn
it's a japanese anime so you can't be totally sure tbh
kaiba boy doesn't have a vagina between his legs tho
that's just regular gay tho
ctually i don't want to know, nevermind
up until 4 and 5 in which case they're no longer traps
that you're wrong
i'd argue
damn
Helios
:((
also no
how tf did hunchback beat mulan
but the promenade is where all the euros go to shop and shit
except there's 2
but it's just mg5's pick your sidekick thing
i thought it'd be like a
LOL&gt;
now it's tied for first place
but yeah
i always knew cho was familiar but i couldnt remember from where
holy shit
but look at that shit around her shoulders and tell me it isn't retarded
(puke)
anyone wanna viciously murder one other?
duck game?
thats not all that bad
hell yea
since they fucked up the hair
oh and aviator is trash too
no it's a really good skin save for the GIANT FUCKING DUMB SHIT AROUND HER SHOULDERS
it'd be the best skin in the game
got rid of that bigass stupid fucking fur she's wearing
but it'd be 20 times better if they fuckin
no she's fine
i only played her in a custom game vs some bots to test out
best model in the game
 by far
all her models have that ass
she has an ass, but the actual outfit is stupid
fuck me her kit is fun
i played her on pbe
ty eric
not in silver &gt;.&gt;
if he's bot you do 2 camps and kill him
if he's on red side you go red wolves go to his red and kill him
that's just late game
and that's as kindred
that's the only upside
that's
and the shoulder spikes just get grabbed by anyone who's not mentally defunct and you get thrown on the ground and killed
they're curved inward
actually that's a fair point diego
that's fair
ik you don't
and now they're gone
it's completely different
there's more to frostbutt than thiccness
she's thicc but there's literally nothing else positive about it
that's not true
but i won't cause she'll be perma'd
it's so cancer
like the kind of thing i don't want in my games
she doesn't look good
since she'll be banned every game
there won't be a few weeks tho
and now irelia's gonna be permabanned
irelia didn't need it
's trash now
looks like her abilities mark targets and if she dashes to them she gets a reset
yeah
what the FUCK was that???
in disguise
or a bioengineered clone super soldier
yea
cause he is dead
thats why he was kicked off
so he had to assassinate basedyoona
it's time to feed
and it's pretty fucking gross
gives me cancer
gives me cancerous 
they rework irelia before nunu
she looks drawn
this is the first time i've ever actually seen one of these memes before you posted them david
nvm i'm just a retard
since that's kinda doing overwatch an injustice it doesn't deserve
personally i wouldn't attribute the loot crate business model to overwatch
if we're talking the modernized, acceptable loot crate systems
so that's 16 games right there
ea's been using their gay loot crate model in all their games since fuckin
i'd argue against that too
that's a little cancer
if anything that's an EA thing
it's not if you want to win
since everyone has this group chat muted
i feel like this may be the worst place to call for action
lmfao
if anything erykah badu is just shitty ratchet bjork
since bjork’s first album was in 1977 and badu’s was 1997 20 fucking years later
and this is the first one where he’s objectively wrong
david i just saw that meme
this means i don't have any phone numbers any more
so when i plug it in, it can't recognize my phone, because my phone is disabled and i can't confirm anything from the phone
i didn't have itunes on my new comp
it's disabled forever
and it's not disabled for five minutes nah
and my phone's been disabled
saturday after work i realized that it's been sometimes pushing buttons while it's in my pocket
hol up that's fucking funny
same
like
and it's been 2 months
but like you won't be relevant until session 24
but you'll die session one
you can't start as the rogue trader
you can't
yeaah it's not that lmao
it's not rogue trader shhhh
: ^) 
:)
my camp pain would be space 5e, all the regular shit's there, but you can homebrew aliens and maybe classes and we'll balance it out to keep it kosher
Michael lasted 30 seconds
Bruh this ni🅱️🅱️🅰️ adds me to your group chat where he and miles talk trash then blames me ???
kms
why don't void champions look like those fucking things? those look fucking terrifying
are they a bunch of negusians or negusites?
negusi

i'll give it to milo tho
o why'd you buy tho?
cause i cant run the game
actually miles and parsa just got beta codes from me for free
what the fuck did i just read
i’d hand out more keys for vermintide if i had them
sorry i changed subject tho, i like was responding to miles' earlier comment
you won't be in range enough to land all 5 hits of your passive, unless you manage to hit w
i can't see her being an adc when people spam cait, kalista, and trist
she'll be like swain levels of underwhelming
she won't be buffed
she won't be nerfed
she'll be nerfed before she comes out
i feel like you'd be banning kaisa less to not play against her and more to not have her on your team
i feel like you'd be banning her less to not play against her and more to not have her on your team
it's an auto attack buff
camille doesn't have a 3 hit passive
kindred's at the very least is not a passive
kindred's at the very least not a passive
look when a day goes by that Eao isn't treated like a whore in some way shape or form, she'll be surprised
he's also a lot less cancerous to deal with
it'd be 6 ur right
it'd be 4
you'll run out of sorcerey points faster
it's balanced by the fact that sorcerers don't get spells back on short rests
which means quickened spell double fireball don't work
the post that it doesn't stack at least
i didn't see that
there's also
that's cause of survivability
you're supposed to tell me every 10 seconds like a good gm
i haven't rolled anything but 19s on those
next time i go into a fight and start dying i'm gonna commit honorable sudoku in the middle of the biggest crowd i can find
that'll be dank
i'm hoping to get to the point where yew just eats spirits and demons and shit and has 10-20 entities living inside him at all times
to give them babies and steal their souls
that's pretty scary
yew pravaal doesn't give a shit about any of that anymore, he's a high elf
or a blackmsith's apprentice
you'd have a farmer
you'd take off that fucking stupid commoner tag too
because it's not
it's the same thing as if i were saying that white on black violence is a big issue
but you're still responding
it's rly not
and i'd outheal any damage they manage to possibly land on me
don't you even know about hay fiends?
they're just commoners
you're just racist
all i'm saying is commoners deserve names, backgrounds, and personalized stats
and adventurers aren't always men
monsters don't give a shit what they kill tho
i'd say male and up to 50 can have a 12 str
and nonentities
except they get generalized to 10 because they're commoners
because that's fucking retarded
it's low as fuck
can't read, cant talk
there are a lot more people than the bottom .1% that can't read
that doesn't make sense
yea but life doesn't follow bell curves and averages
yeah but that's retarded
it's not
eric my dude idk why you treat the handbook like it's a god damn law manuscript
but 20 isn't the peak
no they don't
just because it's unappealing doesn't mean it can't ever happen
it's just nasty
they're just nasty
they're just not attractive
but they'd have to be an orc
as soon as u jump you're just dead
and who's in it?
no
no that was 8/10
had the social shit
just this one
no lul
which is why i want to kill you
i know
you motherfucker
i didnt use that phrase either
you motherfucket
you literally just said what i was saying about the movies
oh my fucking god eric i want to kill you rn
MEMELO
LOL
they gave no shits about killing everyone and thats great
the best thing about this movie was that these superheroes were just super down with killing everyone in a room
unexplained 
yea
no its like a thousand year old hologram
and nobody walked through for like thousands of years
just a big hologram
it was a hologram
itll tilt you
you wanna know
eric
and that gave me quadruple cancer
he was like the chad of black lives matter
and he in the movie was like the ultra BLM nigger
those dickheads give me cancer
nigger
hard r
he was literally just a nigger
and he tried to prove his point by killing black people
he was like the radical black lives matter fag
no
no
stfu
so if you can pay to have your tumors removed id say go for it
the villian will give you cancer
you can see it if you want
it just doesnt pierce
like a bullet hurts
and like force from stuff
bit i think the thing was he still felt pain
the claws have always been stupid
idk man
that was nice
he also beats a nigga with his fists and head
a sword and a shield snd spear
no gun
yes and no
the panther god was bast
its just twisted egyptian mythology
a metric fuckton
a fuckton
according to marvel they would make hoverbikes and spaceships
yes
they would make hoverbikes
its slightly better
yea
in the comics i think there was also alien influence or something
and marvel movies are designed to not let you think
i mean it doesnt unless you think about it
those two made the movie slightly enjoyable
i would have given it that if it werent for the bald warrior bitch and gorilla dude
lmfao
yes
which is why its a 4 and not a 5
and it is dumb
that is what they want you to believe
yes
yes
marvel has never gotten anything beyond a 1 in the believability category
and that cant even be said for thor ragnarok
the onlt thing realistic about this movie was that gravity pointed down
it was utterly unbelievable 
there really wasnt any in this movie
its not hard
you make the “ancient aliens” version of egypt?
true
its not like its a whole new idea its just a comic movie
i mean the aesthetic was true to the comics tho
yea but thats fucking boring as hell
and the movie would have been over
tchalla could have said 6 sentences to neutralize that one power grab situation 
yea that shit was retarded
yea but every time you quote me eric you prove u cant read
yea but i reaaaally enjoy making eric say stupid shit
im not talking about the average of all movies being a 3/10
or if people score terribly
learn to read china boy
thats referencing movies that are not from these days
[1519279522] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: these days 3/10 is average

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
thats not what i said first
i was never not referencing a larger set
above average in comparison to other new movies in comparison to all movies
im not saying that tho
???
no
that movie was good
the first one
and like iron man
im comparing them to things like casa blanca
if only 2 of them are good
but idc how many black actors you cast
tru
lel
slightly different meaning there
not the average
the idea is that the rating is the standard
pixels got that rating
pixels
you know what got rated 5/10?
and these days its not
but i am not
id be down if i was home
which shouldnt be the case
and only 7/10 movies and upwards are worth watching
that means that an average 5/10 is unenjoyable at best
because that makes the rating less reliable
i’d rather change the average rating of the movies than than the value of the average number
that average at around 3/10
which is better than the vast majority of movies out there
its slightly below
but yea
trust me i only meme
everything sucks
nothing is good
these days 3/10 is average
nonono
yea i was rating the music
better than 2/10
good movie
but still see it
and the villain gave me triple cancer
because they replaced most of it with traditional african generic crap
the rap to generic crap ratio was abyssimal
4/10 movie
we’re gonna find some actual reasons to roast this movie
im gonna go see black panther in like 20 minutes, had to hang up cause i was leaving the house
milo’s got it down
dope
w0t
dark brown hair light anything eyes (ok)
dark brown first then jet black
no wtf
milo just said that
wait tf
r like 3rd
blondes?
wat
Who's the best then?🤔
I love blonde girls
and my screen is too broken to function 
im walking around
...
ye
yea
i hit call instead of leave
mb
if you disagree u quadruple gay
yes
gragas aint no bih
if that was the definition illaoi would be the only thicc bih in league
but she thicc
she gonna succ
B I G   S U C C
but at least she thicc
she’s gonna suck
and ashe
xayah doesnt either
kog doesnt need it
she’ll suck
every adc has some movespeed
tru
yea
been too long since we got a hot new champion
ur right tho eric
ult and e
but a 5 hit passive? comeon bruh
she looks broken if her damages are high and her cds are low maybe
wait kaisa doesnt look broken
she looks fun as shit tho
reksai is supposed to be the thiccest bitch to crawl out of the void
idk if i like this one
sarah kerrigan?
in my defense i got home from work at 1 last night and went back at 10 this morning
lmfao
rip
i’ll never see her
she’s literally unplayable by low tier players 
rip
ah
camille is good and probably wont get nerfed
or camille top
you can camille support
yea understandable 
RIP
tbh the game is in an ok spot concerning kindred
ur ass is grass
watch the fuck out dual twin
so 
i can at the very least beat zombies at league of legends
with a fuckin 83% winrate on kindred
yea
o i finished carrying myself back out of shitty bronze today
hi
if you're waiting till 6 for me
DIGBO YOU'RE A KING
we don't have those
goddamn that's straight savage
depression
ur in the shit now
MILES LOL
or maybe i've just heard loyalty and love too many times
maybe it's just cause of that
you're definitely right about that too
that's why pop music went to shit
and i hate that about rap, when it's not about the music and instead about the money
he's showing off but integrating that into the message of the song.
he's not like adding any bullshit just cause he can rap fast
but there isn't a single word in that rap that isn't poignant to what he's trying to say
nothing even begins to approach for free
there isn't anything that comes close to wesley's theory or hood politics in dam in terms of lyricism
it'd have been nearly impossible to make something on that level again
i mean it's tough no matter what when the album before is TPaB
i mean it's tough no matter what when the album before is TpaB
he didn't use it much before damn
it's 2 parted
which isn't that great when the song is three minutes long
and that's sad cause i liked it
with "something's in the water"
honestly that's four too many
and that's three too many
because i don't have anything good to say
it's weird though
i definitely didn't realize
my criticism was that it wasn't good rap
me i don't mind rap
that's it
they can't be perfect
but they can't be good
people can't be good
it's not a label you can apply to things
thats why they're ideals
ideals aren't achievable by humans
perfectly good isn't possible
good isn't possible
i've said my piece
that's good
doing your best isn't enough
it's not
you don't
how do you know that you didn't just save five fuckin stalins?
how do you know that the one person that you killed wasn't the next ghandi?
that's the serial killer shit
it's the justification afterward
you're an idiot
and you're wrong
they're wrong
if they choose to kill one person instead of four, and then go home and say "oh well, did my best" they're not right
thats the scenario we're arguing
because you're wrong
no you don't
you're now "The most wrong you could possibly be"
you're now "The most wrong you could possibly be
you don't deserve a title that good
you're no longer flatisjustice
i've also changed your name
because we've already established that you're the most wrong anyone could possibly ever be
i don't care what you have to say about it
lets say you're hitler's dad or uncle and you somehow knew he was going to try to kill all the jews.
if you get through all of it i'll give you five bucks
cause it's so fucking
i can only listen to it fully when it's in the middle of a playlist and i'm doing other things
insane is raping a slave C:
naw it's not insane
that shit's also boring
it'd actually be so fucking nice
that's it
i wish he didn't say i am t'challa in the end tho
that's fair
but that's like only kendrick
that's not okay
don't say oh my gosh o my word sixteen times
i didn't listen to the end of that song
all you have to do is listen to downward spiral and you'll get it
i guess i like rap when it's unconventional
not that much, but it's alright
if it's done like
i don't mind electric
that song isn't gonna be in the movie tho
so it's even worse
thats fine
k
cause there would be 0 point in putting me in a facebook group
ok
do you mean a facebook group?
yep
think thats a good way to drive a kid in india to suicide
i
i’ll try it i guess
not the rohit ones
thats also cancer
like at least four hours after that conversation is over
the problem with that is that when there is something interesting i never find out until afterward
and thats not counting the spam
im already past my limit
but like
bro id do it
rohit messages a lot right?
lul
some idiot was speeding in a van and ripped off the whole front of a korean woman's car
i don't even wanna call him that much
im just the only one who flames them for it
i mean we know what happened
i was gone for three hours and i have to scroll across the entire continent of north america
what the fuck
:(
and it makes me sad that there isnt any online for it
pyre is really fuckin good
boys
that doesn't look like thats what level 3 is
that's like
what's that?
don't even have to do right
all you have to do for level 2 is understand what's right and wrong
you're just not human enough to mediate
i'm a better mediator at like my job
because eventually they'll get sick of your shit
it's just a fucking massive pain in the ass
conflict isn't something i'm afraid of
i'll accept that fact after i beat ur ass
lel i'm at 2
but it's pretty simple
i mean maybe it's not if you're a liar
eric you suck dick at life and you're adopted
based on results i'd be 9w5
wait bilo is that your first orange?
same
but everything before and during  the movies is dope
its a little gay
im not the hugest fan of the post episode 6 shit
more or less
so naw the eu was way better
and those are hot smelly garbage
all we have is the original series, the new movies, and all the 3d clone wars shit
none of them
they’re not anymore
no
it was definitely better than what we have now
and so was swtor and kotor and all that shit
so it was fine
i mean it wasnt ever claimed un canon until disney bought the rights
sidious
whoops
but not sideus’ body hopping
yea
its retarded
they did tho
so yea its that now
i mean all that shit was cut from the canon when disney bought the rights tho
palpatines motive was to be the most powerful sith and live forever
and they kill each other all the time
sith are top shit
sith are cool as fuck
but if you pay attention i did only say jedi
not gonna lie that is pretty true
like after the entire movie
at the end
he was in it for 2 seconds bro
honestly the jedi and all that good vs evil shit is one of the most boring parts of the star wars universe
and its like easily one of the best star wars movies
also rogue 1 was a star wars movie without the force
nigga got that juice on lock
he absolutely has it
you cant say that nigga doesnt have the juice tho
dejavu
dis nigga drop nonstop fire
lmfao
lol
wtf did you do?
in league?
if waterboarding is the kind of thing you find rewarding
i know a game thats rewarding for completionists
thats it really.
yeah.
i feel like this group chat is accelerating my crippling depression
fellas is it gay to kill all the jews? i think they should all die, but i dont wanna be gay or anything
im heading home to get my shit
yea
THIS NIGGA LOOK LIKE JEFF GOLDBLUM FROM THE FLY
LOOK AT THIS GOLFBALL HEAD ASS NIGGA
ty
yes
some dickhead let their dog pee in my apartment’s fucking elevator
then campaign, when?
if we’re going to kbbq on sunday
hol up
yea i have work tomorrow night
sunday free post 4:00 pm
: |
have fun
cant make it
nope
depends what day
or wait
im down
lol
swain dumpsters every champion
flair
in terms of like
coolest shit in the game
the passive with the ravens
still tho
*mobile
he can blow up squishies if he gets on them tho
less monile than kass and doesnt quite do gp damage tho
truuuu
you can fuck him early
only at lvl 9
but yea his ult lets him 1v5 better than illaoi when he’s ahead
its only balanced cause his low damages everywhere else
understandable 
well that happens when nobody knows what he does
yea
but hes so fuckin cool
new swain isnt strong
so in 1v1s you probably have to wait the whole time, but can end it early in teamfights if they're grouped up.
it's based on the health you drain
the gameplay previews aren't that good
this nigga standin still, coat waving in the air like "kneel, bitch"
ranked is good guys,trust
it wasn't the same without you
don't know how many there are tho
you're also limited by the slots
cause don't they play like
I don't even remember how to play that game
since they're just fuckin googling cards
mouth want burritos
hell yea vro fuck ur stomach
weeeeeeeeb
just buff lethal tempo
since its useful on anyone
fleet’s fine
naw
revert the ult changes
doesnt deserve to be as good as she is
and mf
fucking nerf the zoe bitch too
fuck that shit
and i dont wanna be forced to use my gay nigger star guardian skins just cause everyone else has them.
i mean you can look good without skin previews
whats with riot and these stupid pointless client changes?
and pointless
thats kind of stupid
but that's probably just cause we're ahead of the times
but only if you're hanging upside down from a tree
i want my bitches tied to the fucking ceiling and gagged so i can't hear their whiny bitch voices
or you're like shouting ook ya ook during sex
yea i don't know about that one
that's pretty gay
yea
riot just made T1 a millionaire
20k in one day

i thought it’d be like, top down. one of those gpd games

milo's support just runs away

team?
yea technically
charging monkaS fees?
monkaS

nice meme
we’re definitely going tonight though, right
that'll feel good af

this is incredible
i just made a new account to play with some skrubs

i knew there was a reason i turned off notifications for this chat
from veggie tales
the fucking cucumber
is that
kappa
yea
kinda sucks they were so obvious about it tho
everything’s got dlc
understandable
like the selling point was always the sandbox portion
isnt the story just like a a side dish compared to the whole of the game tho?
thats cancer
wow
project hunters is kinda fun tho
urf is shit as long as its random
fuck pbe
little late m8
happy fucking thanks fucking giving, fucker

yea i do 
ay if yo not nibbas got yo back they got it
yea he definitely does tho
dont trust those nibbas
thin lipped nibbas are sus
i mean black mouths are more characterized by thicc lips rather than wide ones imo
yea
for black nibbas
they’re thin
but not all blacks do
he also doesnt have chicken smacking monkey lips
yep
yea
ohhhhhh
but he’s not a nibba
the lack of curly hair is offputting
well
is it makeup?
yeah
holy fuck
i wish
im working all weekend :( but maybe i’ll call one of those days off
my mom comes into town on tuesday
fucc
jeez

a tournament was laggy
and it was laggy
you dc’d 3 times
or did eric call someone a nigger in all chat
did you win any games?
cucks
wow
you guys actually come in last?
oh did
Did you guys win
i saw what she looked like for the first time while i was looking for a video of tyler1 fighting his fans at twitchcon
her hair and glasses stand out too much
i dont
said “sup,” then left the building
i was in my gay af uniform tho so i was looking like a dweeb
mfw i walked into lilipichu of all people at the weaboo bread spot right next to my job not 2 minutes ago
he scared me
i removed him
yeah he was really creepy
vore is like the blood and shit right?
i actually know someone who was into vore hentai
you gon venture into the darkside
what actually*
what do actually turns you on at that point
fuck man if your nutting 31 times a day
i agree with that
yah
just my experience
idk
like they will argue and debate you if they don't agree with what you say
and they value their opinion over others
like they usually just roast other people for conversation
at least the people I've met
usually act like him
but i feel like people from lower class areas
idk if its just me
including franny
i kind of just removed their entire group
he's still in there
sorry eric
and left channels
from everything
so i removed them
okay fine i won't play with you anymore
but yeah then i told him
i know he doesn't really mean it
and franny was flaming me too, but he just wants to be able to flame someone because he never gets to
etc
too
then tells me franny is annoyed of me
telling me he doesn't want to play with me if i don't the call
he starts flaming me
after like 3 games
so i didn't join to concentrate
and i want to not feed
cause its not fun to hear his bitching
i didn't want to join the call
but yeah pretty much
then his own champion
like he spends more time watching me
he flames me specifically
like you help me realize what I'm doing wrong
yeah but its constructive
i think i may have told milo
did I tell you guys
you know what happen right?
lol
oh just noticed its apologize
and begging mikey to convince me to let him talk to me
so he can apoligize
you know he's been begging me to talk
Why is it called the roast of dualtwin
but like i guess if you dont ever let him get close you should be fine
i just assumed galio would win based on their respective kits
lul
gp players
galio will ruin you
fuck no
ye
even more money
and then gives you
if you hit a lot of skillshots it pays for itself
i guess its sort of like a cull tho
oh
but yeah
u already brought that up
sample size
o sorry
the winrate is also relative to the pick rate which is less than 1%
and really good at xerath
the people who play support xerath or spellthiefs xerath are probably really good at it
what's team doing?
arivdead
team has arrivd
fkn roasted
is that dom and qt?
but this one had two clearly correct answers
i feel like that'd be more applicable if it were any other question
i mean
two of you fucks willfully voted “im autistic” and im not even surprised
dont want it
i
the jpeg is so strong
omg
is in that picture
who the fuck
so tilting
its
if i didnt dc every minut i’d be so fuckin good rn
LMAO
bitch i make black people look fantastic
i was very confused
yeah thats what i was thinking!
i had no idea where we all knew dual from and assumed he was digbo’s friend
i literally forgot he was a person who existed
oh he’s not part of this group.
but we’re always using his discord, huh
its been a while since i’ve heard anything about the dude
i forgot about franny
holy shit
he looks like this meme
he looks like a faggy mexican cross-bred with a bulldog
he looks like a faggy mexican cross-breed with a bulldog
what is he, black?
anye?
also
i dont know how to respond to that. the missing it and the pointless apostrophe is distracting to the point where i can’t gorilla rage at you or cheekily copy your grammar sass
correct my motherfucking wouldnt?
did you just
bitch
i dont know his real name tbh
i still wouldnt say hi
and i recognized him
if i ran into him on the street
i dont know him
i mean
dont care one way or another
um dual?
that was an hour ago
o wow
call shenanigans
oh
wat
r        i         p
the fucking emote
beautiful, paraa
ye

exterminatus
oh god
socialization
lol gay
i just got in a league game :(
holy shit
i'll figure it out
gaaayyyy
oh
i've been scouring the dell website for something along those lines but have come up empty so far
would be dope
that
oh
s' not like a new car
if you're not ordering for a business
i don't think you can get those
oh, naw
idk
of the loan?
i can wait it out
it's cancer
k
and not deal with loan crap
or wait another week for my check
and buy the computer tonight
do i get a 300 dollar loan
so heres the question
lmfao
that shit used to be so hype
and are retarded
just cause they like her more
and replaced bernie with hillary
its like they looked at the model for bernie vs trump
that's not even close to right
that's so wrong
buy them now
preseason hits tomorrow
i'll buy a bunch of champ shards rn
preseason is gonna be a fuckin fiesta
so it's not that hard
ok
is the projectile fast?
fuckin yassuo
LOL
asol is a jankum boi
jank
but he's also
yeah
some jank shit right there
and asol is
azir is a dps mage
tru
*asol is
azir was too
asol was
ye
including that
everything i say
90% of
for like
that's a good mentality
heh, fags.
i can understand why you wouldn't like her
so
for men of quality
she's a manly man champ
she's not an egirl champ tho
and janna
that's fuckin broken
maybe even 5 or 6
i was thinking it'd be like 10 at best
that's so long
40????!!!?!?!
bro this character is awesome.
is fuckin gay
which.
but i get a feeling that whatever you pick up, you press w to use.
i hope that's how it works.
being able to pick it up off people is retarded enough
just removed
ofc the guy who made yasuo made this bullshit
zoe is fucking awesome most broken piece of shit ever
what other non-faker mid laners exist is a better question
egyptians=africans=niggers.
those are some dirty niggers right there
and egyptians fuckin believed in prepping human bodies for the afterlife
egyptians were niggers
greeks burned/buried their dead to appease their gods
rome did yeah
bro these niggas didn't know dead bodies got people sick
if anything they'd think it's a little bitchmade
so its not a tool that's available to people in war.
you couldn't spread the plague on a whim
back in the greek and roman era
i mean to say
naw
that's warlike these days
that means i win
get fucked
that's smart as fuck
leona's a smart cookie
not that similar
he's not god of defending tho
apollo is the gayest of the gay
apollo doesn't do fighting
her theme is athena
yeah but that's just her kit
it's athena
if there's any greek god she could be compared to
did you just call leona apollo?
nibba
wait
in a very not ugly way
taric is ugly
astraeus maybe
not sol, since taragon's greek, rather than roman
wtf
that'd be dope
they could
yeah that'd be better
instead of shitty lore events
you mean like in game events
oh
and they need to update the freljord too
noxus vs ionia too
it's lore, not a fucking serial novel
the cliffhangers need to stop
that's fucking retarded
yeah
bro
he's dank af
he could just not be a part of it
asol is technically not from taragon
that was literally not having a single active brain cell
that wasn't tilting or inting
are u kidding me?
i play better than hashinshin there
holy fuck
feelsbad
a big problem tho is that league is pretty hard to pick back up after dropping it
solid brick wall of skill improvement
solib brick wall of skill improvement
fuckin
yea i would know
yeah
dogs r the best
LMAO
that dog is fuckin outtie tho
and im fuckin tilted
in response to miles
“that’s d’amores”
nobody said
im with it
yea no that shits dope
and thats fucking dope
its not as blatant as the others
idk im down with urgot’s edgyness
fuck kayn
idk who thought that was an ok idea
yeah
she picks up item actives too btw
yea
yeah
flashes 3 times
just

riot’s on disney’s sparkle powder
Edited previous message: much better

i see it on the discord server
oh
a rat?

i don't know what that is
cancerous, but passable
but i guess its passable

whoever did is an omegacuck
idk
fucking bitch man
connor better ask
not me
lmfao

this was the point i was making though
though
ur not wrong
fuck you im suuuuper good at dota
but you can't ever tell what the fuck's going on cause all the abilities look the same

bronze is literally less toxic than normals
yeah i figure silver's worse
im in my b1 promos
i want to get the fuck out of bronze
no
they're gay yacht dad clothes
no
those clothes are gay in that they're fucking gay
i'd say yeah but in silver you're like just barely getting the hang of things, and by including it they can test how beginner friendly certain things are
since us bronzies have no idea how to play the game
they should add that you need to be at least silver 2 to get a pbe as well
cause fuck bronze
and if i could play league i'd be playing ranked
im on break at work, sadly
tfw you arent a bitch nigga and already have one
this video is fucking insane

*boss battles
music is an art

i havent heard shit about cuckhead's fanbase
LOL

my fuckin autocorrect
...
the fact that you used the be cool thing to replace both a b and a g really threw me off
one day im gonna make this in real life
lmfao
i thinks so?
by just now i mean like 2 mins ago
they gone
dont have :/
i will tho
but the other took me a hot minute to realize
one was rly obvious
they were both traps
i saw this pair walking
like just now
but not too many traps
so there are a lot of gay guys
sf is very openly gay
cause like
i dont think thats totally the case
no
ive seen more in 3 months here than i did in the year i was in SF
on the real, LA has a fuckton more traps than San Francisco does
yo fellas
UGH yer telling me people actually find places to live on this?
suck my dick
gtfo
i didnt say team, bitch nigga
fuck graves
idk, ask [B]ilo
you mean the mysterious hacker, who's face has never been seen before by anyone, 4CHAN?
mucho
muy muy shinderu
lol
what the fuck
my mood has never been so effortlessly destroyed in my life
when are we gonna go see blade runner 2049
nibbas
also that bitch got one sock on and it's fuckin tilting
she shoulda kept spinning.
that kid is an IDIOT
fuck yes
oh and squeezy is the fuckin hero
that's incredible
whatever the fuck this nigga said wasn't even remotely related
like
that's incredible
and the nigga literally didn't mention vegas once in his thoughts on vegas
i read that whole thing
milo
why'd i start that with also
also milo
dont talk shit about anna
its anna
same
why?
ty my guy
thanks, bless up fam
and i fixed it a little bit ago
it was set to the wrong day on skype
oh
thanks
i was straight dead asleep mb
ye
maybe more like 20%
like a solid 25% dead
im feeling
but ty
just not in this gay ass group chat
nah they did
stay till 10 tho lul
i go twice a week but start at 1
understandable david
ikr
yeah like half an hour ago
nice
you?
yeah im chillin
AAAAAA
lets play some fucking videogames
YA BOI 20
WHATS GOOD FUCKERS?
o yea im sure they're insecure as fuck
because comedians in general are overflowing with charactet
*the
rhe exception is fat comedians
eric's almost right
ok
yeah it wasnt supposed to not be autistic
yo milo i was tryna emulate those basic white bitches
(ok)
wow you guyths are like tho in thynch how cute
"mistakes were made"
yo that dad in the background of the trap picture is like
thats almost blatant heresy
yeah milo what the fuck
nvm your descriprion may be correct
it came from shy ronnie? lmfao
nvm
o whoops u right
and for some reason people just keep saying it even tho it wasn't that funny.
cause haHAA came from the fucking deez nuts vine with that guy who had a jaw like an actual gorilla
and we're gonna totally ignore the fact that even if it is a thing, what you described is definitely not what it is
when the fuck did something like the phrase haHAA get attatched to a specific type of joke
that's not what I mean
nonono
what's a haHAA joke?
wat
you just gotta question how much of a joke it is.
where its gone on for so long
there comes a point
look at dunkey
like
i don't think he'd be too nervous to play league with a dude he's tryna fuck
punk bitches disguised as muscular men
or
don't gay people like punk bitches?
nigga.
you see em in his videos
yeah.
and instead all they did was make a bunch of nerdy dudes go full on gay for like two months.
im sure xayah and rakan were released to make more women play league tho
which has probably happened
sky willums introducing any of his friends to league
that's like
i mean i'd make a new account
lol
i'd play jungle and make that bitch mid
fuck no
except not really, cause i'd rather jungle
lul maybe
then stay the fuck outta sight
i want that bitch to make me a fuckin sandwich and ward my goddam lane
is that the case tho?
it looks like hell
this is so filled with quotes
hah fag
eric call them a bunch of nigglets when they fuck up
our aim isnt known for being good.
but i cant make any promises
i can roll up with the boys
rip
 r i p
yea
traps arent gay until theyre naked
 michael's right i guess
you should probably just cut your dick off so you can fuck guys without it being weird
you dont want to get caught in the middle of the scale milo
r i p
i drew the scale
so youre not a trap
you dont dress up like a girl
no
of the trap scale
i'll draw u a picture
but they're not
i mean
w h a t?
thats a trap
traps are 100% dudes
but after the surgery you're not a trap
yeah
since gender identity is just a lie that people vehemently try to believe in
not the same thing
no
well
same thing
a trap is a crossdresser
yeah
yea they do
if they get breast implants they're a shemale
surgery counts
which is still gay
past that its a shemale imo
any bigger than a cups
traps dont have tits like
memelo, my guy
i mean lounge wine'll be alright
ahh thought you meant in the rooms
in the lounges?
eric being on or off the stip isnt the point
tf
is so not free
the wine
its called not blowing 10k on a vacation
no
like from an objective standpoint you're wrong
but your point is wrong
eric you're trying to prove a point
yea
eric you are fuckin dumb
you are stupid
you dont know how money works
eric
thats absolutely retarded
vacationing from somewhere in the US to somewhere else in the US does not have a starting cost of ten thousand dollars
we're talking the US
we arent talking mexico
what the fuck?
nigga no they dont
wtf are you on eric?
and middle class people are fat
middle class people are
arent tourists
rich people
no

dont go on vacation
rich people
hotels arent usually filled with attractive people
you fucking destroyed me
diego
wow
where even is that?
thats nutty
milo what the fuck
while you eat both halves on seperate plates
look at the waiters the entire time
and like
one at a time

a health pot's worth of gold is nothing
unexpected power spikes

most of these rewards are fuckin dumb
hm
that name is dank af
i think mine is toughguy69
jesus
Our Lord Helix
im probably just depressed i didn't think of big coin
tbh
yeah i feel

i'll only be able to play at like
rip
cause you could feel safe behind it
mhm
ew
it's a glorified anivia w :(
mhm
bitch ass chigga
i don't like that the soldiers stop interrupting dashes after they're out
ic
and since he's slower you don't have to rush or anything
right so it'll always go off
rly?
he moves noticably slower
he doesn't move as fast?
so
but riven's shield is stronger
it's riven's shield duration
make it last 2 seconds at least
that's boof
o
&gt;.&gt;
in the late game it'll be solid
70% ap ratio
oh they made his shield awesome too
that's solid
but cucked his range
they increased his damage output
rip
right they shat on his range huh?
whoops
*good
how god is my nigga?
u good
ye
im p sure they give you your username in the email
you gotta get on the pbe client, and just hit i can't remeber my password or some shit
you just recover it
so
its fuckin stupid
and it doesn't crash as much
than i do on the normal server
i legit get better ping and fps on the pbe
too bad fag
hah
 wait lmfao
yeah
i can get through the early game, generally
cause like
its funny
im not home
naw
rn?
ye
now that she's not crazy busted
when i was tryna get back into riven
and me every once in a while
and the youtubers
all the streamers
that wasn't a joke
a belated april fools joke
rip everyone but me
that fuckin sucks
real?
i
like
how do you not have one yet?
also
how does one's pbe get deactivated?
how?
wait rly?
use jetts
rip
o
play him as much as possible
play him rn
is pretty funny
that
ye i doubt it's been updated yet with these
ohhh
yea
they're also on messenger
that took me a bit to realize it was urgot
the urgot one tho
it's pretty funny
the fuckin katarina one
those memes aren't even good compared to the others
just like base skin ahri
doesn't ahri already have one of those?
that's the biggest thing we have to worry about.
when yellowstone goes off we're fucked
but like
since that's mostly like the san fernando valley and shit
LA and everything south won't get too fucked by an earthquake
i mean
and fucking brit fags
truuu
3 hurricanes in one year
fkn
midwest and east coast is so fucked its almost comedy
yeah
trump's gonna fuck that hurricane if it steps up on america
we've got hurricane jose now
holy fuck
is so fucking good
the editing in the first one
r u fucking me rn?
is the middle bitch fucking riven?
he was funny too
ye
fraud
no im sure he didn't
no
did he say something about them?
i mean he's popular as all fuck
it was him
he did say crafted
o god
cause nightblue is a fuckin nut
i bet he did
yeah if he didn't he'd be fuckin broken
cause he would have shit mana
he wouldn't
no
good strat
getting rid of the tear makes him useful
so enemies spike earlier and harder
his build is just really expensive comparatively
mhm
he gets fucked
but once the sup gets it
yeah
well
so having him solo in the jg makes sense i guess
the problem with ez was that he was outclassed by ardent censor adcs in lane
i mean
tf
meniscal
the ardent censor nerfs went through, right?
right
and the sup probably is too
but that means the top is a supertank
and stealing buffs is easy with like a q auto and smite
yeah your counter jg harass sounds pretty dank actually
idk it doesn't sound as good as graves
red smite is good in general
i mean
ic
yeah
only in the jg
or is he building normal ezreal?
so he's building for that attack speed?
it makes 0 sense
ez doesn't have anything to help him survive
ez is like
and the knockback on his autos
yeah but graves has the armor from true grit
he's trolling
how??????
how
w h a t
what
*wait
ait
fucking hilarious
you still called him a fieldnigga tho
lmao
you called him a field nigga
had you said the word at all?
thats depressing to read
jfc
lmao i guess you're right
what a fucking faggot
and he immediately started hitting on you???
you told him you were and e-girl
that shit is fucking hilarious
the first review
sorry my dude
lol rip
it's difficult to talk about.
you and eric can
the title was perfect for the time
the title was perfect for the tome
so like
its a remake
is the best kind
a well written horror movie
how was it?
you guys went to see it?
and its kinda shitty
yeah tbh this place feels like more high school
excuse me for being geographically illiterate
well
i keep mixing the 2
OHHHH
w a t
are you at samo rn milo?
oi
ez
put kindred in dota and i'll play it
cause its not like people are faster in dota than in league
understandable
yeah
haha
dont make fun of my fat fingering my phone u shitbag
ehehe
regy
remi
regi
k
thats so retarded
thats retarded
an adc that can become immune to cc?
wait
fuck olaf
thats olaf
mechanical skill vs game knowledge
that's not too much
the tradeoff is its more expensive
oh
sit in lane and get items?
so everyone can just
wait
or have different jungle monster spawns
like base a character around doing different things at day or night
if you make the day night cycles relevant its pretty cool
idk
uea
thats retarded
yeah
to secret shops
to sevret shops
there are items that are s p e c i f i c
so you're telling me
*dota
idk dora just doesnt look snappy to play
that shits fuckin awesome
having a dude named carl is way better
why do they have the stupid titles tho
tf
T R A X I S?
WAIT PARSA WHAT
lmao the alarms
rly boring when you say it like that
that sounds
rly boring when you say it like that
that sounds
wow
feels bad
you can't solo carry?
unfair levels
like
yeah
that's fuckin savage
the enemy loses gold
wait
like to retain the feel?
is it cause it was based off warcraft 3?
to intentionally make movement and basic attacking unresponsive
it sounds like a bad idea
like that sounds bad
why is that intended?
^
is it on stream?
is it good?
o yea?
still
you got sven for that
no
i can't find any like
0 backstory
yeah
shit game
no kindred
naw
ye
*moving
with how the characters take time to turn before movint
it looks unresponsive as fuck
fuck dota
wait the face even looks like a mei face
exactly
^^^^^^
that shit is blubber.
i feel famo, but here's my defense
is that a drawing of hurricane irma as a thottie?
oh holy shit

*ornn
just
orn is pretty fuckin strong btw
there's so many complaints
yeah
but all the concerns are just left behind
jokes and shit
and they've responded a bunch to other crap
and riot employees have not responded to any of the criticism
i'm reading through the comments on the page
shit like that
or tank ekko
tank fizz
cause of like
i can kind of see why they'd reinforce specific roles
actually
it could be fine
just all across the board
if they do that
yeah
fuck new players
riot doesn't revert changes
they wont
actually nvm
if it flops they can just revert it
true
exactly
nobody asked for this
its like
it was cool to have champions able to perform multiple roles
but why reinforce certain playstyles for champions
maybe
ic
so fuckin similar now
they'll be
take teemo and kennen
i mean
is pretty retarded
which
rather than your champion
so it's more like how you play is defined by your keystone
mhm
way too much
these keystones feel like
still
alright that's okay
so i assumed there were just the keystones
didn't know about the mid runes
ok
ohhh
in compensation for a removal of customization to your base stats
you literally get one thing
and all you get is the keystone
oh god
is it generalized?
is it
not a good thing
that's
so everyone will have better base stats?
ic
how tf is kindred gonna jungle without the stats from runes?
i like the old runes better.
this is a worse decision than plants
league is going to become garbage
i saw that
oh
now i feel good about myself
i went on reddit and zoned out to cringe pics
i didn't read that, milo

its the ultimate burn to harry potter fanfiction
fuckin tops
its not long enough to feel like it could be serious, but the writing quality is like
its actually perfect
holy shit that story is comedy gold
oh i missed the a in at
t one time, he had dreams of being an actor. The larger he grew, the fewer agents and scouts would come calling, until they finally stopped altogether. There wasn't much in the market for a squid that would split a schoolgirl from stem to stern.
might be the best couple sentences of trash writing ive ever seen
this
what the fuck are you doing with your time, eric?
omg
like
that sounds fucking retarded
hell yeah im gonna read it
thats the best thing ever

devourer meta
^

yep
yea
i read that very wrong
OHHH
o
i'm never on facebook lele
wait both?
because they're stolen
david's memes are the best
ofc
well
that anna one is so fuckin solid
true
like damn
pretty fuckin high lately
your meme quality has been
jett
either way i'd probably be better off drinking a gallon of bleach
idk
a furry one
or maybe
it's actually a pretty gay outlook
so it's a good time
but it's kindred
they may be aggravating
oh they'll all be fun
and 19 games that i don't wanna play
than i can playing 1 game of urf kindred
playing 20 games of normal kindred
if not more
i can have just as much fun
kindred doesn't need to be all urfed up to be fun
but see
you can't bait me like that nibba
we already know im boosted
tf u think im doin?
i'd rather get to silver
it's called bullshit
its not
no see
makes it immensely not worth
the fact that i may have to play 20 fuckin games to play that shit once
so im boycotting that shit
i've never gotten to play urf kindred since random urf started
nevertheless
fling yourself around the map firing arrows like nobody's business
you just
all kindred's shit
kindred's q would be so awesome
so its not worth playing
so i dont get to play kindred
except the randomizer favors the especially broken urf champs
idc about winning
gtfo with that shit
i wanna play champions i like to play
i dont wanna play some op crap
random urf throws balance out the window and lets you do whatever you want with the table scraps rito gives you
urf was only good cause it threw balance out the window and let you do whatever you want
but random urf is not good
i see what you're saying
milo
^^^
i'd rather lose in ranked than play random urf
random urf is unplayable
you might be gay
im sorry milo
milo?
are you playing urf?
no
and fuck you

idk
forever
*him
kick hi
Faces are in short supply these days, I know. But try to send me one anyway. You may be surprised to learn that even you have a face.
Gahhh! OK. Laptop open. Where do I start?
And, ya know, a PLACE TO LIVE.
I can't even THINK about kids! That requires some serious life skillz
You got kids?
Send me a picture of a face.
(hearthands)
shut the fuck up or get kicked parsa
Send me a face. They're normally found due north of your shoulders.
i think same has always been the best word tbh
team where are you?
Tired
nope
same
stream?
idk i'd say that's pretty close to a fire hydrant
a bachlorette
oh lol
a tree?
a fire hydrant?
if not a mom
what is the closest approximation to what your mom is?
wait milo
i had a dad
it's already a thing
gender studies?
YES
i can't respect the cucks who fuck traps knowingly
i can respect traps
Go on, then. Send me a face.
Picture of a face, please.
If you've got a face lying around, send it to me, and I'll tell you exactly what I think of it.
h o l y fuck please don't
as long as you don't know.
if you don't know you're clear
that's like saying anal sex with a dude isn't gay because you aren't touching his dick.
it's a trap because it looks like a girl
it's not a trap if it doesn't look like a girl
I'm not here to chat.
Send me a face. Yours, for example.
Fuck you faggot
you lagged out my skype &lt;-- same here
Yes you should
you lagged out my skype
same
Try sending me a picture of a face. You can probably find one at the front of your head.
Send me a picture of a face.
If you like frank assessments of your face, good. Because that's what I do.
(heston)
he isn't cool and he will judge
except eric
we won't judge
or you can take it like a man and be gay, we're all cool dudes here
if you get fucked by a shemale tho, that's a different story
and go fuck a shemale
take comfort in your 10% not-gayness
just with a shemale it's 90% gay and with a trap its 100%
it's still gay
that said
*isn't anything you can justify it with
.....
there isn't anything you can justify it that wouldn't make you completely delusional.
a trap is a dude who pretends to be a chick
you put woman first there
a shemale is a woman with a dick
for instance
there's a difference in how you can think about it
rly he lives here?
what????
...
jackson wyoming
looks like thats what im gonna spend the next few hours looking for
thats rly good
oh fuck
but this place is nice as hell
i only been here for 1 day
hell yea

this right here
here
apparently the town is basically donezos with corona
if you decide you want to come by sometime before october we will make room for you
heres the view from one of the windows
my mom’s friends house is pretty sick
took a solid 26 hours of driving but im in wyoming
alright
i love it fkn hilarious 
hahahahahah
i needed to turn my phone over
know exactly what those letters stand for
wait i definitely 
i dont know wtf that stands for
uh
cause the house that we’re squatting in is still filled and we’re waiting for the owners to leave for their 4 month boat trip
we had to take like a 6 day detour
nah
love me somma the rat
i was

oh
what swsw thing are you doing tomorrow?
also
its pretty dam fun
and this is nba jam with superpowers
i love nba jam
it's so fucking slick
once you get good at it
but the gamefeel of pyre
and i know it's good
i haven't played bastion
i still unironically think pyre is their best game
now thats a good fuckin bundle
oh shit they added pyre to the $5 itch io bundle
alright sounds gucci
hahaha
would you prefer i gave you a 1 day notice or a 1 hour notice?
yes
but
it's fuckin impossible to walk through my room
aight
ruin whatever you've got goin
and just
i'll just barge in on you and your gf
i can actually save money
since im not really worrying about rent and shit
cause
i'll prolly swing by new york sometime soon
i mean i'll see you for sure
yeah
to organize my fuckin dnd tokens
i took like a 2 hour break
nearly all packed
im good
so i get that shit
it's like nearly 15 min
you don't gotta watch it all rn
how u doin?
yo
this video is fucking god-tier
but
im sure you have not played this game
this game is bs
fuck darkest dungeon
BAH
get that donation money from those overpaid spergs working at amazon and google
gotta get super big famous
yeh
no time to waste
gotta go real quick
yeah
to stream the online mode whenever it comes out
or better than speedruns
ngl i just want to stream cyberpunk speedruns
makes sense
exists?
that
a streaming class?
that was pretty great
yeah
so why tf not?
i was just thinking that my coronaputer would be good enough for me to stream shit on and have it be quality
yeh
and we can promote ourselves
so i'd get me and some creative motherfuckers to play on twitch or something
it would be pretty sick
first
but i gotta get really good
to finish my book and become a dnd streamer
i came up with a great plan
but also
*year
the plan is to finish that in this years
i'll probably come back
after i finish the book
like
and wyoming is pretty much that
i need some place where i don't have to constantly be shitting myself over money
and rent in la is a nightmare
this house sucks
tbh i feel pretty good
uh
yeah with my moms
but cuz corona and my landlady is being a massive cunt
well the original plan was to do so late august
and not set in stone until 2 weeks ago
3 weeks ago
cause this shit was decided uh
yes
then who knows
jackson hole for a year
moving to uh
yeh
so it's not my problem
*friday
but i'll be out of here by frida
because that's fucking disgusting
i don't want to cook in there
so
every night
also my fucking places kitchen has been getting fucking filled with flying motherfucking termites
yeh
and it's a massive pain
so i've been learning that shit
im good i just got darkest dungeon from the GOG summer sale
wow bloodborne
lancer big good
wow thats a lotta stuff
rip your memory
good luck my man
lmfao
bruh that picture
wtf is this
oi
you can still go out and do things that aren't looting
11pm is workable
geez
1pm in samo
it's true
crazy
they just changed the curfew to 5pm
hybernate or smth
either way nows the time for us gamer guys and gamer gals to retreat to our gamer caves and chill for a while
but I doubt their bullets are fuckin rubber
they’re not shooting people or anything just guarding specific places
yeah
and now we’ve got the national guard out in CA
its really not good
There are a lot of stories of individuals that are using these riots to stoke the racism fires in both directions 
wtf
and keep doing what i was gonna be doing regardless
tell a good story
so imma just write my book
but I don't want to be a martyr, and it seems like a lot of people who are out there rioting do.
but I don't want to be a martyr, and it seems like a lot of people who are out there rioting do.
i hate our current system too
if people want to burn the world down i'm happy to let them
like i look at the pushback i get when i say this stuff to you or my mom or anyone really and it's pretty clear that the emotion and the tension is running higher than I have any right to try and calm
at the same time I don't think i can say anything to stop them
and im not gonna get myself caught in that
i think things are going to escalate until a lot of people start dying
i don't agree with the direction they're taking
as far as the riots and stuff?
better to distance yourself from alll this crazy shit and focus on yourself
anyway
yeah def
all 4
and those cops needed to be imprisoned
some cops specifically are the worst of the worst
i mean they're people
that's all
i just mean the policemen are much more scared after that
but they incited this by burning that police station in minneapolis
cause this behavior needs to be exposed
demonizing the protestors
im not like
that's nuts
not good
yeah the police out here shooting people
my dad fuckin wants me to riot lmao
also the riots have been getting really crazy
too risky considering everything you've got goin for you rn
frankly
good
gonna riot?
what are you gonna do?
lucky her
cool
i see
yeah dude
or staying in ny?
are they heading back home?
oh right school year's over for ya
yeah
lmao
that's nutty though
cool
i didn't know julia and noah were sharing an apt
right by usc
one half day of riots and instant city-wide curfew
yeh
if it has both
i might just pay for a month of that streaming service 
Finding these movies has proven to be a massive pain in the ass
where tf did you watch these movies
and the himboness
im excited to witness the boolishness
alright
also wtf is a brother sister movie
which one first?
i actually cannot turn that down so I guess im watching both tonight
alright
fucking
LOL
fucking hilarious
that's
any % begins at loading screen lmao
its amazing
you need more ammo
and seargent
a meeting with the general
DUDE
OH
lmao
i'l be able to play absolver like 50% more
it'll be sick
yea
with almost all the bells and whistles
with corona neetbux, i'm aboutta be able to build a custom desktop pc
shits real
bruh
because this is solid fucking gold
im not getting any sleep
tonight this shit is putting me to bed
oh sick
(ok)(ok)(ok)
the art is wild
wow that looks great
electric guests, right?
or at least whatever you gave them pre interview
all of them are up on there
on the page
i'll check it out
nidhogg pyre
nidhogg basketball
wait room looks sick
no way he's power rangers guy
charlie li is he
also
with poggers
otherwise i woulda spammed the chat
I had to wait 3 mins before I could actually message you
fuck yeah
i got on just in time to catch yours
AYYYYYYYYYY
O
oh shit you're on
i’ll just have to watch it then
do you know if a video will be released afterward?
is this a stream?
oh shit
hell yeah
so what are you up to today?
hell yes
good shit man
well i wrote it on the itch.io page didn’t i?
best game evah made
didn’t fucking doubt it for a sec
yup
ofc i have to shill it
im in the game
yeah
sweet
mind if i spread the word of your masterpiece?
yeah
have you shown it off to milo?
i am of course, rooting for my boy
oh fuck
oooooo
that'd be awesome
hope they give you some cash money to start funding your game
well gl
so what happens now?
that's pretty great though
you just gotta kick yourself in the nuts and improvise the whole thing
i think it seems we know where your strengths lie
god damn, that's quite chadly of you
ooga booga man mode?
good on julia tho lul
that's a bricks shitting moment if i've ever heard of one
the pitch was today, right?
oi
sounds sick
knew you had it in you
thats fucking awesome
oh shit
the next 3 chapters are kind of all getting worked on together, so i'll send them through when i keep going
and there's one moment in tracy 2 that's kinda real shit and i think i can still tack more onto the chapter, but i've moved on from them
i think the first kisket one is better than the first tracy one
i added more
idk
tru
hmm
10 sprays per second
so its like
spamming the start of the blood spray
well
makes sense
that
so my computer really can't handle shit
on my laptop
and i also don't have any graphics processing
not enough ram for my shitty comp to handle those sick graphics
maybe it's cause i have too much background stuff
without giving you the actual death screen?
does it spam the death scream and do that shockwave effect across the screen?
hm
will lag the shit outta my game for as long as its open
well alls i can say is that smashing the t key while standing on a savepoint
wtf
really?

two steps ahead motherfucker
by the elephant
but i was slamming the t key so fast there wasn't time for an actual death animation
and on the second time the game hard crashed
then i jumped into spikes twice
i hit that shit like it was a mommy gf for a solid 5 or six straight seconds
and then running around and dying
by smashing the t key way too much
i may have broke the game a second time
also
very good
eventually i sank into the ground like the tar and just died
yeaah
yeaah
which is great
was able to get over
i wasn't able to do it
gonna see how easy it is to get myself stuck in that wall
to strain the physics engine as much as i can
and just fling myself as fast as i can go
its also cause i play the game like a spaz
big fucking retard i just run my face into walls until i go through them
you know me
cause im a brainlet
and the screen shook real bad
i went into the wall
and i had to reset
that said when i did get up there it glitched out
but tbh it just made it easier to get up ther
that wall is there to prevent that?
where i walked off the map right?
up there btw
i think you put that wall
it's good
10/10
i was grinning through the rest of it
that shit caught me so off guard
the music change
no
fantastic
fucking
and the dead seedpods hanging that teach you how to deal with them
and the minotaur ghost
i love him
and the death count guy
filled it out
the just extra finishing touches of art
it's so good
oh my god
fuck your whenever im playing this isht rn
oh fuck
ofc i do
yes.
once i finish the thing and begin editing
that's gonna be one of the bigger changes i make eventually
is the white suit guy who points out the ship
is the white suit guy who points out the ship
i didn't highlight it enough
that fish amphiron
also
i moved way too fast through the first three scenes
put that at the beginning, 
eventually i'll restructure that chapter
text convo
especially that insight with the uh
it definitely was
the next chapter is kisket
i'll send you more
hm
thanks for lookin through all this dawg
ok i finished reading all the notes
drink some fucking blood and channel my inner nic cage
could definitely lean into that
so
i do remember the whole thing feeling like an lsd rage fueled fever dream
that said
i don't know the tone you're going for in swsw though
yes i do.
yes
it rly is
yeah lmao
also i fixed the amphiron/earth human all humans thing in kiskets chapter
also these tips have been very helpful
im usually nitpicky about that too but it looks like i fucking missed that routing/rerouting thing
thank you for catching some of the double word choice things
also
mansplaining is the way between us
manly men
we’re both dudes
don’t ever let me hear you say you were mansplaining something to me
also
thanks for hitting me with the critical eye
lul nw
sure
after din
dw bout that
oh im on like chapter 7 rn
alright
but i haven't actually gone back to edit it
this context
just not
but you'll have context
it's just the first chapter and i realized that without context it does nothing to set up the character 
yea
ok go ahead and read it fucker
tis trash
don't read t
ech
thanks mang
ex dee
it's pretty nice
yeah
when they first dropped it
and they made a big forum post about it like 6 months ago
they keep the servers running
eh
they dropped it 100% to make a different project
yeah
but apparently these guys like my characters
hate monologues as a player so i just resolved to not do them
rn im busy trying to write a fuckin monologue for the dnd game im running
pretty good time
long story short
but yeah
so if you press buttons with all the rhythm of a monkey with adhd and constant muscle spasms they just kinda stand there taking the hits cause they don't know what else to do
and none of them can deal with awkwardly paced combos
cause they don't really know the mechanics all that well and they're generally pretty shitty at mixing up their jab spam decks.
but they're really predictable
so people just run drunken style, light attack spam, and the real dicknoses run a power called sharp impact, which makes all your attacks deal a bit more damage and chip your hp on block which is not a thing normally.
for reference, most attacks that come out as fast as the drunken style's stumble thing, that don't have super armor give like 7 frames of advantage
which is enough to guarentee a decent hit
that gives like 14 frames, of advantage
and it's really easy to use it successfully because it's got catch-all dodges and one super armored stumbling thing
jabs give a bit too much frame advantage, the parry class that i like to use has issues with buffering commands, and the drunken style gives way too much frame advantage when used successfully
the game was left in a somewhat unbalanced state
and it's very fun
and every once in a blue moon you run into an oldie
still it's kinda fun to beat the crap outta those guys
but since the game's dead, there aren't any good players left, and the ones that are have just been cheesing their way to high level
like riding a bike
but it came back to me
cause i was getting my ass beat
coming back was kinda shitty
i got good again
yuh
independence training at its finest
and then have them find their way back
take their whole bed while they're asleep and put it out in the middle of the city
like
so that they become super tough
just means i should maybe stress them out a WHOLE bunch on my own
idk, i don't think i'd want to divorce the mother of my kid just so my kid can handle stress a little better
hm
at that point definitely
milo, jett, were trevor's parents divorced?
yah
i've had a pretty even split of friends with divorced parents vs undivorced parents
eh
now that i think of it
i suppose
oh lel
yeah they are
what do you mean it shows?
well i mean it's not like divorced parents are the most common thing in the world.
none of them
really?
cool
small pog
the basic basics
all i know are like
what's she like?
i haven't really heard much about elizabeth
oh
very chill
ah
whats the plan for today?
but chilling is good for now
yeah i honestly can't wait to see where you go with swsw
nice
nobody wonders that
gonna party?
what are you up to now that you're done with all that crunch?
well
and people wonder why pc is still the master race
that's sorta dumb though
that's sick though
jeez
you can finally take a breather?
oh shit
totally donezos?
the demo that you're showing off?
hows it goin with you?
s' goin great
and it's fucking hilarious
you can actually see the degredation of his psyche in his video history
but youtube comments turned him into the monster we see today
he used to actually be pretty chill in his early videos
just fuckin chef's kiss perfection
just fuckin chef's kiss perfection
are incredible
but his robots
and that's alright
the guy is spastic as fuck
yeah
makes me want to play halo ce again
also holy fuck that clip
but michael reeves is a goldmine
im not usually a fan of those offline tv gremlins
fantastic
is
the payoff in the end
michael reeves new video is quality content
and i just clap all the sale noobs and fake jades that are left
made a new ass spanking deck
got some new fresh ass dubs
lul
i love this broken ass game
like a lil bitch it had me crawlin back
and im playing absolver again
i finally caved
btw
but they're close
they're not quite Deathconsciousness good lofi drums
they're pretty great
im a fan of those lofi drums on this album
yeah
dominating this randomly generated listening session
king krule has been uh
i see
this aint on spotify
O?
so clean
from the sun
those water effects
nice
*game art
for the art?
really good spot
its just that im currently in a really
oh it's not because im trying to be a good playtester or anything
and it was already sick
it got sicker from the last version i saw
good shit with the music
also
stand still till you get back
im gonna
yye
4 is 7 pm your time
oh
still gotta unfuck my sleep
from now until like 4
i'm super down to try the game over call
either way
literally now

i was asleep by the time ya sent that
sup
:000000
ez glap
then wednesday at 8
then tomorrow at 4
like go to bed at 1 pm
and slowly go to bed later and later
gotta reverse psychology my sleep schedule back into shape
actually, lying down to sleep just gave me a great idea
but yea. sleep schedule is fubar’d see you in five hours dawg
had to dig through an assload of prog shit to find a description of a fuckin planet.
i think its very funny that i missed all your blatant hints from 3 years ago that Polya was gonna join horror squad and be the last member of team 3
i think its very funny that i missed all your blatant hints from 3 years ago that Polya was gonna join horror squad and be the last member of team 3
anyway, yeah, thanks for the imput
that way i can sully your boy's good name without doing Raros-g dirty
except with a curbstomped ego, cause there's another douchebag out there that everybody knows is better than him
exact same massive douchebag asshole (voluntary) incel
Grandson of Karcin, son of Polya, Raros-en
Im gonna have a Raros that isn't related to Raros at all
actually i just got the best idea
*80
i was thinking of having him be 80\
i wasn't planning on using a mid rp raros
and inability to carry the weight
he's been pretty fucked up due to all that GUILT
but it's self imposed volcelling, based on the thing with karcin, right?
true it is
but it doesn't matter as of rn
i believe that krayna is a very persuasive individual
ok cool thanks
cause it sounds like something he'd do, or at least threaten to do, constantly
alright
wouldn't want to do your boy dirty
i will take this answer into account
assuming Raros-g wasnt a massive pussy and had a son at some point, what would be the likelyhood of him naming that kid Raros-anything
i wanted to ask you for your expert opinion on something
Oh
lmfao
not like a quick thing
a solid 4-5 straight seconds
for like
shits hilarious
it's goddamn fantastic
is that the real voice for the show?
is that real?
that one's a fuckin doozy
THAT is a high tier meme
cause
did you edit that into the actual game
i watched that snap you sent me 6 times
here
is legit the best line of 2020
"baby imma love you if you look like a crab in five seconds
wait
but i'm not a massive piece of shit so remind me to send it to you later on
i found a youtube video that can definitely ruin the rest of your day
i got halfway through and i had a minor migrane

it's guarenteed to give you a headache by song 6
with no boy pablo

wow
thanks
but uh
im not entirely where the change takes place
hopefully the message doesn't get lost in translation.
but then i think it sorta branched into more esoteric forms of meaningful crypto communication.
it started off being on topic
fill the thing with emojis to absolutely ruin this first impression
lemme just
not flowers
oh those are uh
is that her with all the hanging colorful flowers?
lemme find her
venmo rite?
my playlist is there
i did
very cool
cool
or does she just put up with you being a massive nerahh i see
is she in game design as well?
yuh
but that's because i didn't ask
yesterday
uhhhhh
see you told me that you were interested in someone a while back but i knew nothing about her until
nice
it's a compliment
:P
yuan
you got yourself a big tiddy asian gf?
elizabethyuan?
ok
it matters
hold on are you saying anime openings are the okay ones or the ones i should judge you for?
probably
:0
i see a looootta japanese
i can't tell if it's full of bangers
seems shifty
family mix
so i just hook my account into the plan or smth?
sounds great
o
yeah.
hows it work
sure why not
uhh
hopefully though, if i get going enough on this manuscript that won’t be a thing for long
do enough of that at work
so i just leave that shit cause i hate picking up after people
idk what i’ll do about the kitchen, as much as i like it being clean we’re all paying 100 bucks a month for a cleaning lady and it wasn’t like an opt-in thing
ye
a gamer den or some shit
cant invite ladies to my room and have it be like
yeah exactly 
getting a gf will do that to you
sick
or in the rooms.
oh like in the living area?
thats how it goes dawg
justin runs the house?
nice
now it looks pretty nice
like someone who isn’t me
i actually went and organized it a lil while ago
its about the size of a walk in closet and my roommates are complete slobs in the kitchen, but it’s mine
best vaccine is to just get that shit over with xd
energetically and all
like chicken pox
yuh
maybe its a little weird to be saying that but
get too deep into your head
dont let that shit like
its true
damn
i see
are you checking every day?
the place is so compact theres gonna be 5 people within 10 feet of you at all times
i mean it’s like almost impossible to practice social distancing in nyc
confirmed ones, right 
is awful
that
oh yeah
but the thing spreads like a motherfucker
thats not all that much
nah i haven’t checked
seems like the answer
nice
but like I don’t ride the train or bus for now cause i’m not like an idiot or anything 
im mostly just jokin bout all that
im not all that isolated, at least not more than anyone else.
i’ll hold u too that dog
its really good. Didn’t work, still ended up going insane, but not because of the voluntary house-arrest
and uh
i went and got kenshi to help me not go clinically insane
hows the isolation going? you gone insane yet?
yea def
but that’s still pretty spooky 
shit your pants you’re gonna die
and not like
that said for us it’ll probably just be an inordinately bad flu
hopefully you’re alright 
:0
anyone myself 
but idk
i know people who know people
nah not rn
what about you? ny rent is no joke
though that will take a while
and i can get coronapay from the govt
i've got my parents helping me out
yeah
its not ideal
im not
and her simp
1 thot
which is essentially easy mode
im creating my first team
i caved and bought kenshi to stave off the boredom of being under voluntary house arrest
alright
they rly out there trying to kill their employees
oh yeah i'd heard about that gamestop shit
thats it
salt, parsely, garlic, red pepper, lemon
if you don’t have enough salt after boiling your pasta in salty water you can add more
you can add black pepper but this is aglio e olio five flavor pasta and adding a sixth flavor is  illegal and punishable by death
put a bunch of salt in that
salt the pasta water
OH
parmigiana cheesiano
stir it save half, and then eat the rest with some parmigiana
then dump the shitload of parsley on it and squeeze half a lemon on that
then dump the pasta and that bit of water into your garlic and red pepper oil
drain it, leave a bit of water in there
then wait for the pasta to finish
i put a lot in there
not necessarily hot ones
red pepper flakes
either way put some hot pepper flakes in that
but when it’s dark brown and kinda crispy it’s way better imo
the garlic might burn if you leave it unchecked
as soon as it is, either take it off the heat or turn the heat all the way down
when the pasta’s like 1/3-3/4 done you set the garlic in some olive oil and get it sizzling
chop up a shitload of parsely
while the pasta’s cookin
cook it the minimum amount of time on the box or less cause that aldente shit is king
put your pasta in that water
first you slice up like 4-6 cloves of garlic depending on how much you like that shit
the pasta’s simple
lockdown sucks
well fuck
aight
best tasting shit
simplest shit
its that aglio e olio i talked about
try this pasta
but
not sure if you're up
o
i definitely still don't believe
and 2
1 i don't believe
which
my friend's parent's friend's friend in the secret service
same here tbh
:P
game on
in which case
unless you already did that
i guess
buy food and shit
so
i heard from a sorta untrustworthy source that there could be a nationwide shutdown in the next 48 hours
how are things going for you?
sup
check it out whenever you got time i guess
here's the link
it'll be great
and they have to crash the stock market and incite an uprising from within the labor force to free themselves.
where all the devils are running primetime businesses
and send them as souls to corporate hell
eventually im gonna just say fuck it and kill all of them
that's where i get my fun, yeah.
so all in all i did a good job
but now they're paranoid.
eventually they got the balls to go out and kill everything
absolute genius
and they came with the plan of barricading themselves into one of the chambers and covering all the enterances with heavy rocks.
and i got to make the cave just be totally disgusting, while naked goblins crawled through tiny tunnels and shot arrows at them through holes in the walls.
i had them track some bandits into a cave system, and they turned out to be a family of hick cannibal goblins that had been eating people off the road for like 15 years
i literally just spend 5 hours catering to the whims of the weebs while parsa spirals out of control
happy fun sparkles and rainbows or anything
which isn't to say that it's like
3 mega weebs and parsa
is great
my game
fuck the gym, my anti-social personality makes me instantly hate any space that has other people in it
the entire time that im in my room
and just go to town pretty much
not even at a gym or anything i just bought some weights on a whim at target
and work out
and then write my nerdy books
go to work, come back make dnd shit/play dnd shit
other than that i've been a mega nerd
the most interesting thing i did was probably see that movie that i told you about last week
looka you, slaying all the citezens of poontown
wow
is this with someone unknown to me?
a relationship?
probably for the best ngl
yeah it seems like that's the case for a lot of schools
cause of the school closing
have you been under like semi-house arrest?
that majorly sucks
:(
np
i've been letting some people read it if they wanted to give feedback. so i can stop living in an echo chamber bout that shit
i been feelin pretty shit about how my book was going, and that was impacting my mood. so i went back and rewrote the beginning a third time
here
oh
how’re u?
in chillin
just saw it with me madre
real fuckin good
like
its really good
not that at all
but its also
yes i know its a jesus movie
check this movie corpus christi
Oi
a furless cat
like
i thought it was like a cat
i actually don’t know what he’s supposed to be
yeah he do be ballin out
aside from being an animal
i mean
wow what the fuck
it is sick
sorry in january
not 4 days ago
the mechanics are fuckin weird and i thought maybe they'll inspire you or something
it's like a demo, 30-mins to an hour long
released like 4 days ago for free on steam
star fetchers
just cause it's fucking sick
except i found a game you might wanna check out
been basically doing the same as always
im aight
a half zombie half decrepit robot lizard thing?
feel like half a zombie
classes beat you within an inch of your life yet?
hows it going my guy?
ofc it's like a mini swans album
its a slow boil imo
and washer while having an awesome climax
that mash your face into the AC vent shit
but you know me i like the loud shit
washer is dam good
lmao
very sick
and the segment at like 3:40
and i fucks with it heavy
good morning captain’s got some kickass snare drum shit going on
i love nosferatu man
yes
he's not too good at it yet
and uh
its his first game
he doesn't
and a few weebs from SF
so not him anymore
parsa, jonah took off for a thing for a few months
and is nothing yet
mine started like 3 weeks ago
im just in it cause i have a shitfucking ton of money
ok
eric's is uh
and then theirs mine
there's eric's with milo and miles and jett
honestly it's 11/10
like
so
parsa's a gay monk
that's essentially every session
1 walks out
3 on the spectrum tieflings walk into a bar
so i'm prolly gonna give it prio
rn is the good dnd group
i'll listen tonight
ok
rly
but i def didnt listen to it back then
probably 2-3 yrs ago
im p sure you've told me to listen to it
:P
but never the whole album
i've listened to bits and pieces
gonna have to do that
idk if i've ever listened to it all the way through
in good morning captain?
it's absolutely nuts
yeah thats the one
ofc you do
chills, man. CHILLS of the spine.
and then i listen to it and that drum flair gets me EVERY time
every once in a while i’ll forget that disappeared behind the sun is actually a perfect song
fuck man
the latest k6bd page is a biggun
fuckin shit
yeah it's funny as hell
but this is fuckin amazing
jonah loves this shit
i've actually seen this before
karmic balance restored 
this makes up for the other thing
new page oh shit
also
you're welcome
it made me feel terrible
and
i had this shared with me today
here
and yeah ronnenfedlajfssfa is a himbo
plowing into the fields is the bomb
lmfao
like 30 mins ago
oh wait it ended for you
happy palindrome day
oh yeah
holy shit lmao
but “cum blizzard” is amazing
the dude making them is pretty fuckin dumb
they are pretty good
extra fuckin points there
used town of salem too
that meme is really good
is fucking nuts
this one
this is the best one
but
i've linked this guy before
alright
but ay what's going on? what you up to today?
ur donezos
that'd be the end
if that was real life
wow
thats a fucked up dream bro
w o t
S L A P S
cause that shit
im gonna say oxygen though
that's so fucking hard
honestly
suh dog
ay is cool
au
u want in on some duck game?
uti
wassup?
ayy
lmao what the fuck am i doin to these tos people
xd
all of his moves are just him shouting and throwing shit at people
if we're talking non jokes, though, definitely gira
i mean
i wanna see niel degrasse tyson or bob ross
lmfucking ao
fdr in the wheel chair?
that's fuckin amazing
HELL yeah
this is what sakurai thinks of your gripes
woulda been the bomb
edelgard
and you just know milo’s gonna main him xd
(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)(puke)
why do they keep shoving this shit in smash?
is the shittiest goddam mc of them all
and this one
the next character is another FUCKIN fire emblem mc
FUCK
gotta shove my hands in the crap
but i wanna play it
its a lotta crap
ye
idk its tough
ok
punishment for not placing it is enough
and honestly i think a reward for placing the checkpoint isn't necessary
*good
and the fact that they have to pick which hub they want to start from is goo
yeah i think the hub strat is good
hmm
i feel ya
nvm i haven't played it in a while
oh
the one you had to leave behind right?
also you traded the checkpoint for the powerup, right?
why did you have it be 2 checkpoints in the first place?
hmm
wait
oh right
i forgot its just 1
right
and also is there a way to pick which checkpoint you respawn at after you drop it?
are there certain parts that clear away your checkpoints after you place them?
hmm
so
i forget about the checkpoints entirely
i mean
ye fair
and that enemies are dangerous as fuck
but idk i kinda didn't mind the one notedness of the combat
but yeah a ground jump isn't too bad
idk about climbable walls though
make it super short
like hollowknights wings
a brief jump
i think as an upgrade it could work
hm
ye
they just gotta get good
and move a lot
with the throwing
you can go fuckin nuts
i mean
lmao
that too
yeah
i don’t think he can do grunge 
i guess he could go for a pink floydish sound
well
as is, at least
i can’t see kendricks voice keeping up with the good shit
thats why im not sure about rock
mhm
his voice is too smooth
itd probably be terrible 
as long as he doesn’t think he can step on papa Rides’ toes and live
but bruh
“Did anyone not named beyonce create more meaningful albums” is not really ever high praise
i mean
Well here’s hoping we’re not boutta see DAMN 2, electric fuckaloo
aight
i don’t want kendrick making anything even remotely near rock
w h a t
wait
dming
but im playin dnd rn
i do
that's pretty decent
rly
que?
but the idea of being in highschool and getting given a gun in the cafeteria appeals to my sense of humor like nothing else.
idk man i think im too into this stupid game
haven’t gotten to use it yet
i bought a gun
in uh monster prom
hell yesh
killer bean man
i got a gun from the gift that keeps on giving.

im leaving in a sec
i just woke up though, ngl
yeh
its so good
got no brakes
this train
yeh
there's gotta be more going on
if the rp taught me anything it's that fights where you just run up and beat the fuck out of each other are boring
my train encounter is fuckin awesome
shits hype
and im way more excited to dm than i've ever been to just play
im running the first session tonight
damn
yeah
until me
it's cool but nobody knew how to use it
dynamic lighting is this bullshit thing they added so that your characters have semi-realistic lines of sight
its the dnd website
roll 20
roll
even though you technically got back last night, i forgot to say something then. so im pretending that i totally didn't forget and am just saying it rn
welcome back to LA
s u p
i learned how to use the dynamic lighting
oh fuck
yuh
im very happy.
so
i finished making the map for my opening train robbery scene
nutty
it shook my desk while i was tryna work
yeah
and go to the beach like responsible dumbasses
and if it comes down to it we just tell the truth
shouldnt be hard
yea
yea
oof
f u c k
oh
when's ur dad gonna sell the place?
i shoulda realized sooner
wow
yuh
kind of a 0 iq move to NOT take advantage of it
xd
no wonder you're down w/ the acid
oh right you have the house to yourself
oh ok
hmm
oh you'll be at your dads on friday?
sounds dope
aight
of bullshit
cause
unfortunately i gotta be home by 8

early
friday?
hm
this one is very good
holy fuk
hahaha
oh hell ye
oh cool

my guy
ay
yuhhh
happy new year my dude
i kinda crammed my schedule fulla dnd shit cause im a big nerd and apparently fulfilling my nerdy fantasies is my top priority 
but next week oughta be good
ya this week i don’t got any good days
OH weve got time then
hmm how long u here for?
im down
k
which is fine
so we’d have to split it
yeah but its only one fullie
well
i didn’t want to
tonight? nah
sweeet
damb
it is awesome
u still in san diego today?
oi
that was so fucking stupid that im thoroughly in love with this game
annnnd im hooked
through the first 5 portals
i was literally juggled
that causes me to teleport randomly when i get hit
and on my first run i got an item
i got noita
so
but ye, whys it fun?
:P
dog when i want incorrect opinions i say them myself
or that death stranding is a fun game
that's like saying the new fire emblem is good
yea
cause that aint legal
actually torrenting the files
much safer than like
yea
also streams arent illegal to watch, just to host
streaming sites like couchtuner
its online
well kinda i saw the first three episodes and the first one was good
no
we don't get to have that anymore
i like gritty star wars man
people just dickride baby yoda cause it's baby yoda
the mando sucks
just kill it
no more star wars
so now it's all bad
but then disney nixed that shit
i liked the side content that was being made before disney did their necromantic fuckery
i mean heres the thing
same
and then hand back all our once beloved franchises back to their rightful owners
break his brain jar and smash it
and assassinate walt disney's brain robot
we gotta raid them
i actually hate disney so much
i don't fucking know.
WHAT
WHAT
what
that i’ll do in my young adult life
it sounds kinda like the coolest shit
yeah
a few temples and then the desert
uh
im hyped but we’ll see
yea
with her for this retreat thing
im gonna go in november 
so assuming she doesn’t cancel all her plans for it
yea
wants to start running spiritual retreats in egypt
but she’s been riding the comedown from that
she had essentially just gotten back when i went to go see her
i told you she went to egypt right?
she’s good
how long has he been playing the game, since christmas?
a master of rng
lol
fucking
wow
oh
sword shield has shinies?
well what you been up to my dude?
you are rn?
i didn't realize that power cords start at like 50 bucks
yuh
and i feel incredibly stupid rn because of that
i forgot my computer charger in san francisco 
waddup waddup
not the wires on my person but the wires underneath my bed.
thats rly what it boils down to
i hate having separate chargers for every single appliance
actually the more i think about it the more physically revolted i am
i can’t do that with a dongle
no bluetooth bullshit, no airpod shitbull
charger from backpack to phone in pocket and then my NICE, PERFECT, WIRED headphones go from that to my ears
its ridic
and o get so much fkn milage out of my portable charger rn
esp in public
idk man i cant stand big headphones
i guess my mom realized i really just wanna hit people.
that and some boxing gloves
wanna die
i
and
headphone jack
no
has
it
and
and got me an iphone 10
my mom went ahead and broke my personal codes
time to kick his ass in smash
oh shit
thats some good shit
coo
whatd u get?
merry chist day my dude
but holy shit that was funny
ok she did pull it back out
she’s actually incredible 
that it’s fucked
just you know
and made the worst face
and then checked on it
and she threw a baby squirrel off screen
i went on to watch mepearl explained
she’s actually just
she’s hilarious 
christ alive
holy fuckin
fucking wow
like
it is an incredibly good fucjin persona
but
im sure its a persona
i mean
i can’t believe i’ve never seen that
holy fuck man
actually terrifying
actually insane
“IM MEANT TO BE GREEN.”
shipt
fucking
holy
and a maybe on the oppossum lady
holy shit
lemme see these fuckers
it rly does
i’ve got 5 now with parsa, so i can’t add you full time, but if you ever want the chance to come in there and kill his pc for no discernible reason i would be very happy to have you
oi btw if you ever wanna guest star in my dnd thing just lmk and i’ll find some way to shoehorn you in
idk why i never thoughta that
thats nuts
and get surprise gimp kills
his attacks are slow cause you can launch yourself at them with your fire hydrant
like his kit is so janky but once you figure it out it looks like it kinda just works
cause it just sits there so you can throw people at it
the lime is nuts
and its evidenced by his usage of the neutral b
than all these other trash players
so much more brain power
he’s just got
yeah man
and that the lime was slow
thats nuts
i didn’t know the bell stuns
high tier pac man is fucking dirty
hes so gimmicky
holy shit
i was also pending p hard
oh ttyl and i will
yuh
went grocery shopping 
i’ve been with my moms
oh it ended a while ago :0
OOF
the pend is real
35 mins
and have no desire to grow or change
i dislike everything that i don’t understand 
for all of his normal attacks
i just don’t like his hitboxes at all
oh, I don’t enjoy snake
i do know that jett has some mad nasty gyro plays
i don’t know the tier list
i never learned him
idk kirby is a nice meme when you really wanna fuck with someone
oh kirby
like mario and nerfed krool and ness and rob and ryu/ken
but there are many never touch characters that come before olimar
i don’t understand him
olimar
...
but you’re a slow boy and if they have projectiles you just cant
just run up and side or down tilt over dash attack
i been sleeper picking them for a while now tho so i don’t mind it
yeah
lmao
and if you can land your shitty slow abilities and create space with your shitty slow dash
they’re actually easy as hell once you stop going for nosferatus entirely
mhm
and levin sword has huge range
and they do a ridiculous amount of damage with smashes and arials
i like the specials
so i just bust out the thoron and onebang them while they try to recover
nobody plays robin
robin
me its just zelda, dedede and robin
and then fling yourselves with side b and joust
you both walk up and down special each other
pac man dittos sound pretty much the same tbh
cause dedede mains are memers first and players second
that said, i’ve never had more fun playing smash than in a dedede mirror
YUP
and you can send it behind you
getting hit by that and instantly flung offstage
its the most tilting special
i mean i only play lucas for pk freeze
good
okok
pk fire?
joker
and fkn
fkn hero
so he spams op characters and learns their combos by heart?
ic
but i still can squeeze out wins cause zelda is op
my smash game has gotten WEAK
yes
cool
icic
well get into LA
when do you get back from SD again?
may b
so rip
pixel mecanic
but
yes it coulda easily been thar
i c
yeah
not good
cause that looks
ok
oh
albeit incredibly hard to make
tbh i think dead cells coulda been pixel art and woulda been awesome 
vector art is dead cells right?
best pixel art in the genre so far imo
like HLD
art
its better when the pixel art is
but yea i feel
i suppose
yea thats fair
the pixel dust shit
you mean all the sparks and shit
thats fair
i see
it looks p standard
you don’t?
looks nuts
yea same
looks like a better wizard game than wizard of legend
im on that shit as soon as i get home
noita looks wizard af
“uh oh, stinky” of the brain
poop in the brain
i have brain poop
and agreed that it was a 10
and i listened to it
wait you already sent me long season
but what can you expect in a society with no free porn
korea has issues
yeah
still tho yall r weebs 
slightly better
so its jpop
its japanese
well
it sounds like kpop
Dx
kpop?
is this
is this kpop?
fishmans?
i may look up the tower hint but working on dnd stuff had me too busy to play games for a while
cause the ziplines are awesome
and then it was good
covering the entire map with ziplines
like i ended up spending a shitton of time just
death stranding is great if you put the work into it being great
xp
and he only tells you once
but i forgot the hint
im in the tower
my skype lagging like crazy
also
all games suck, cyberpunk is the only good game left
but yeah
i like it, but i could never call it good
*terrible
and death stranding is a terror game
sick
oh its out???
ape out was the last one
kinda lame man there are no good new games
its
bet
def
yup
until like last month
fuck get me a fifty cal rifle and a long distance scope we're taking this motherfucker down
i’d never heard of it
nah
lol
that game old af
off is literally old news
check that shit out
new news is this french game called OFF
homestuck is old news
i guess
now you have that big fuckin thing if you want it. merry fuckin christmas 
i sent lancer pdf to your email
oh here
that’s pretty much it for that
when 2 out of 20 characters are good, then your thing sucks and you suck
unfortunately that doesn’t mean that as a whole it isn’t still shit
that was a payoff i was not expecting and was incredibly pleased to recieve
and because of how i researched, doing the other timeline first, and sitting through two 20 page economy/obama rants
and they talk
dave finds obama’s hologram
because 
the best part is the epilogue of the timeline where john stays
idk
uh
jake is a character 
uh
jane is a character 
vriska exists twice
uh gamzee exists and a lot of people end up fucking him
downs are pretty much everything else
but hussie wrote it, so it’s canon
with the shitty fanfic header and trigger warning tags
its even laid out like a fanfic
it IS a bad fanfic
like that
like theres literally 20 pages worth of dave just going off about how much he wishes he could have met obama. and how karkat reminds him of obama and that only they can fix the economy because no matter how xenophobic and awful jane may be, thats not what it’s really about. What it’s really about is the economy. And what it’s really about is Obama.
and he just doesn’t shut up about the economy and obama
in the fuck off and die timeline, dave convinces karkat to run for president against jane
and in one timeline, john fucks off and dies and in another he doesn
the whole thing is about the new world and jane becoming uberrich and fucking up the government for the trolls cause she’s xenophobic as fuck
like
i honestly think he’s never been funnier
but dave is at an all time high
all in all it’s like. Pretty fuckin stupid
and its got it’s ups and downs
the additional homosuck bullshit
but i finished “researching”
so it took a min
arright
hahaha
bro.... no way
san fran
its like we’re bros or something 
what a coincidence 
nice
west?
to go north
im gettin on a plane in a couple hours
aight
beat them with bootleg merch till they drop then hire the 4chan deep web shadow dataminers to brute force their way into disney’s servers and flood them with memes, gore, and hardcore porn until their network bursts under its own weight.
but this time we naruto run down disney hq and assassinate the board of directors 
like the area 51 raid
we should inspire a rebellion of all the sweaty nerds
and this movie is the mile long hike back to the crime scene just to put another bullet in star wars’ cold rotten skull
solo was the double tap
disnet killed it with last jedi
i feel nothing for star wars 
wow
worst shit
actual worst
john boyega was the only good part of force awakens
i rescind that statement 
good
orly
he pushed this shir
fuck john boyega for allowing finm to be royally fucked in the ass like this
fuck the director 
fuck disney
garbage tier movie
shit movie
don’t tell me its less than 10
then i’ll go with you
unless you are
no
and will do
same
lol
pretty much as weeby as it gets
that’s 
lmao watches volleyball anime
and jonahs a mega weeb
its a goon i met in SF, 2 goons that he knows, and then jonah and whoever he decides to add
: V
: V
looka that boy
 LOL
AUGHT
and though they’re all pretty weeby i think i’m ready to thoroughly crush their souls
got nearly all the players 
i’ve been getting set to dm
And its been good
im excited as fuk to hang
Hell yea mang
hell yeah it is
its that oldie
oh my god
whats that?
age of war
oh then what you been doing?
swsw?
what have you been up to today then, mr stuck at home?
i feel ya
lmao
fair
oh
i could totally see that not being a thing that i've said in like 5 years
have i ever said the name of the place?
my dad's bar
hyperion public
mostly cause it's fucking far and im not feeling like getting fucked up or nothin
HP is having a christmas party tonight, but idk if im gonna go
major bummer
that sucks
fuckkkk]
what's good?
SUP
it's incredible
and start spamming their theme idea
and then they immediately get super pissed cause it's 3 am and nobody's thinking straight
like: Nope, bad theme, NEXT!
and then between games you wait for people to call out themes and do everything in your power to shut them down
and 3 am all any is naming yourself stupid shit like Dr Octococktopus and going on imaginary crusades with a bunch of similarly phallic named randos for weeb skulls and gamer girl bath water. 
they're not the same game at all. tos is a strategy game
i like 3 am all any
i don't actually like town of salem
alright i figured it out
what r ya gonna waste time on instead?
nice
does this mean you’re through with throwing subjective numerical labels on other people’s creations as if everything in the world was meant to be tailored to you and your specific desires?
sounds like a blast
hell yea
oh btw when are you comin back to LA?
why's it for dickheads?
wait
yuh
23rd to 27th
i’m getting set to visit my mom for a few days
sweet
what’s up?
aight king fuckaroo
big feel my guy
gmornin
wassup dude
i've cracked the code, so to speak
and i think i did it
with there still being a possibility of a response
and i think i finally figured out what would be the most retarded time to contact my main man
so i was thinking about it
at work rn but i’ll check it in like 3ish hours :/
its finals week my guy ur allowed to have em lol
since you can just fuckin plan 48 hours worth of all out assault
you don't have to plan your life around it at all, it kinda plays itself while you check in once in a while and play the social part of the game
you get unlimited future orders with that
but i bought lvl 2 like right at the beginning of my first game
cause you only get 4 future orders at lvl 1 clearance
it's kinda p2w
i realized why subterfuge is hard to get into
you know what
idk them
which in itself isn't a bad thing
and with mc rides as willy wonka
the album reminds me of charlie and the chocolate factory but on lsd
idk it's hard to describe
but the production specifically was wonky
it was cool for sure
idk i just thought it was weird
hmm
ik
idk why im just not the biggest fan of the yots songs
so good
say hey kid is my 6
lost boys is quite good
lost boys is sick
hustle bones just slaps too hard man
big dipper, inanimate sensation, hustle bones, hacker, and either guillotine or takyon
its changed a lot
yeah its good
hmmm
bottomless pit?
hmm
yeye
 not would be
will be
so
i believe in us tho
yes it would be
you gotta check on your army
but
but at that point im sure one of us could just buy the servers
hopefully the servers are still up
l m a o
that it takes your attention away from literally everything else
its design is so good
yeah thats the problem 
its legit so good
this shits so good
yeah
subterfuge caught me again
fml man
this is gold
thats rly fkn funny man
looking as professional as it does
this shit agows up
and
lokw
fkn dying
im 
its so bad
wtaf
wtf
its not even close
so off
so fucking wrong
hes just
is that hes not even trying to say it right
the problem 
the fact that they sound dumb isn't due to twitter's existence, it's due to them saying dumb shit using twitter lingo to try to connect to its userbase
it's a social media
if someone's being dumb on twitter they're essentially being dumb in public
i disagree with that
i mean
fuckin petty
that's
again
is this what she's saying?
so she doesn't like the fact that black people don't go to her her concerts as much as white people?
that's racist
i mean
.....
whaat why?
:O happy thankness day
its sick
or belly button
just spring into being outta my dude's eye
born from another god's thoughts or actions or body parts
cause most of their gods are like
but that mostly works
that's some optimized worship right there
travel to a specific church to worship the god you want to worship
so you don't have to like
very useful
ye
kinda ridiculous to keep track of tho
definitely
except for maybe 6 or 7
crazy ass motherfuckers who just kill each other all the time
all the gods are like
by far
the sickest religion 
hindu is
primarily buddhism inspired
like
lot of buddhism inspired art there
wait that wasn’t a question 
cool?
ah
why’ve you been dabbling in buddhism, tho?
1 for you unfortunately 
so
probably till 10 pm for me
im on my way to work
lmk
oh my
:0
have been pretty awesome
the last couple pages in particular 
its sick
buddhism and hinduism is pretty much the entire religion there
ya man
im gonna keep at other places too
yeye
and they'd rather hire anyone after that
and 2 they have winter vacations
cause 1 they don't have a ton of projects
yeh
200iq way to save money
which is a genius habit
so i feel like im poor and don't spend
wayyy late
cause i got into the habit of picking them up like
i forget how many paychecks i get in a month sometimes
xd
nvm im good
i was worried i'd have to rob someone
actually wait i get paid on the 29th
gotta make 350 before the 30th
blehh
interview went well but they won't have anything till january
hate
beh
yuh that kinda sucks
yah, yo?
was good
oh man i missed that from before
wtf?
as in pope
no 
yeah
had to trim the fat
saw this line
that would be optimal 
i like going to concerts alone
too
i may just get milo into swans and bring him
i don’t mind going alone
9th is a lil early 
right
its rly the only way to go
sublet it
right now
im buying tickets
oh shit
hell yea
and a lot of good ones that are ridiculously enough 
cause there are a lot of bad ones
but yea you kinda have to shop around for good ones
i was just jk
lol same
they’ll love you
don’t hit on the girls
be cool with them
esp once you get to know the bartenders
it’s aight 
also don’t go too often cause you’ll be broke in no time
bring friends
bar life lol
n i c e
with the homies?
what are yr plans?
AYYYYY happy birthday my dude
gotta leave early
so hmm
in hollywood
but the best, easiest theater to get to is the arc-light
and now im thinking i'll go see parasite later
and then ate food and cashed my check
i slept way in
rn im not up to much
ye
yea
little league is good
oh
its a long ass album
only have the one album
i rate pretty sick
i just checked them out cause they were on your thing
lmao
21 year old boyyy
hype hype hype
yaaaah
O
what you been up to my guy?
so
we can only hope
xd
maybe hovercars will fix it
city's too sprawled out already to make anything other than driving viable rly
already
it'll just make life easier for tourists and people who don't drive
it won't
there will be stations right by them
so kinda perfect
and beverly hills
lacma
but that's like
at least on wilshire blvd
they're in the process of adding some
esp in ny
that do be annoying
i can see how it might take a minute to catch one
even if there are a lot of them
subways in ny are pretty dam crowded
actually now that i think about it
like how long?
rly
tis just too far for a mans with no car
but now its not
and it was kinda fine when i needed to head there anyway or lived with my dad
its rly traffic dependant
yeah
oh
1.5-2.5 hours each way
it’s total time
i don't mind having 9 hours so much as 9 continuous hours
hell naw
doing 5 peoples jobs for 1 person's pay
and then add that on 9 hours actually working there
anywhere between 3-5 hours round trip just travelling
its fucked
i can't stay there
but idk
well it does just gotta adjust the timestamps
*counts
so none of it count
and i forgot to clock in
no break
i worked like 9 hrs
lol saturday was fuckin nutty
sat?
oh that was
what me being at work all day?
?
hah
those kicks are lightning fast
fucking same
its fucking hilarious 
holy shit this is amazing
fk me man
all day
ive been at work
what the fuck
but AMERICAN
cheese at all is fuckin weird
he put fuckin american cheese on that
and then even worse
on a sandwich
why would you ever eat teriyaki chicken
why
sounds fucking awful
that fucking sandwich he described
and lets get this on the record
but
made me laugh my ass off the first time i heard it
machinegun lettuce really fuckin
so definitely not the real dunkey
only problem is he’s a massive weeb
he’s even black
this dude is the dunkiest dunkey clone i’ve seen so far
ic
did i ever show you kneecaps?
simulate that walking man
embrace the meme
but idrc
walking sim was the meme call of duty kids used to make fun of some truly avant-garde triple A shit
it really is not that
yuh
it’s its own thing
but like it’s not
so it is a walking sim
technically it is simulated walking at its finest
xd
it’s actually kinda nuts
its a game about building connections between people and every single part of the game works to support that.
not at all
on like the 3rd mission i left a rope to help people cross a mountain and that fuckin thing basically went viral
which goes into why it’s better to start on release
but for the most part there aren’t time limits on the deliveries, so you’d get more likes for taking it slow and leaving behind useful items
you also get likes from the npcs based on the quality of your deliveries
like there’s a system where everything you place or build in the world gets left behind in other people’s games for them to use. And people can leave likes on the things you leave behind and you have an overall score based on the number of likes you have
uh battery power i guess, but mostly the fact that it’s less fun and it kinda sets you back in the metagame building sharing game
and on a bike you can make them in 3
they usually give you 30 mins for timed deliveries
i don’t recommend the motorcycle option unless the delivery is timed
if you pack say, 4 pccs on your bike you can just build enough charging stations to cover enough of the map to last you 4 hours.
you can hop on a motorcycle and literally blast past anyone and anything without giving a single fuck
OR
and it’ll take double that
or you can wing it and pick up all the dropped packages you find and try to climb mountains and jump rivers without ladders and ropes 
cause you can stack yourself up with a ton of ladders and rope and scout out the area and avoid all the enemies like a pro and it’ll only take like 5-10 mins walking
and also how well you prepare 
it depends on how sidetracked you get
and then you deliver it
then you basically walk your ass to wherever you need to deliver the package to
it’s very fun
so the pouch baby points at them with a little glowing mechanical hand and freaks out when you get close
but they can hear you and your pouch baby can see them.
you can’t see them, amd they can’t see you
but the thing is
the BTs and they want to grab you and drag you through mud and oil to a fuckin monster that will kill you and then explode and create a massive crater
and where there’s rain theres the ghost things
because the rain literally speeds up the passage of time and causes your boxes to rust and makes them really vulnerable to falls.
and then you have to avoid rain
and beat you up to take your packages
You have to avoid package thiefs, that’ll come at you with electric spear/cow prodder things
which you don’t want.
and the contents will get damaged
and if you fall, you’ll drop your packages
And rivers will sweep you away if you get caught in them and get tired
and the entire time that you’re walking you gotta stay upright and balanced so as to not damage the packages. The heavier your load, the easier it is to fall.
and then you walk
and you try and distribute the weight so it’s pretty even
you go to a building, pick up a package. Load it onto your body or your vehicle or your little floaty package cart
uh
monday
i won’t be back for like 2 hours
i literally just got off work like 20 mins ago
heading home
i am
and he can’t talk about his feelings cause he doesn’t know how
he’s the big man with the big sad
idk man
he’s sad as shit
except norman reedus ofc
but they’re always fkn crying
even in the slightest
so nobody’s sad
to this energy shit that they’re using to network america again
but within the first 10 mins of the game, they explain the tears as an allergic reaction 
and i was thinking “oh boy here comes the pain train”
and in like every cutscene everyone is crying
in the marketing
actually the biggest meme
its
literally 
yes
everything you do he’s like “Great job Norman Reedus! With  this we are one step closer to putting America back together. Thank you so much. You’re amazing, keep up the good work bud.”
but that shit was the biggest lie and die-hardman is the most optimistic motherfucker of them all
all the ads pictured everyone as super sad and hopeless
pretty much the opposite of what it actually is
the game was advertised as like
tonally
just gonna say
he’s a fuckin bool
so once shit settles down and the unbelievers and the shitters leave it’ll just be people that actually like the game
so it’s really incoherent 
rn it’s kinda oversaturated with shit people are leaving all over the place
it’ll probably be better then
it’s reallyeasy
the one thing is
its quite good
pretty sure in my serverfull of people i was the first to get a vehicle xd
i never slept
oh fuck its 7 am
like holy shit
so in the beginning i was heading around doing my thing sometimes turning around but never far, but suddenly i had to go all the way back to where i started and the terrain is just completely fuckin different 
and when more and more people travel along the same pathways, roads begin to form
or towers for others to scout through 
and then there are structures you can build like massive bridges to cross rivers and charging stations for peoples electronics
but for the most part whenever you’re in uncharted territory you don’t have access to it
so you’ll have other people doing different shit leaving behind their ropes and ladders and shit if you need them
in other people’s games
essentially what it is is that all your equipment gets left behind 
I don’t think anything will compare to experiencing the first few days of this game
is incredibly good 
the way this game implemented online services
holy fuckin shit it’s 6 am
holy shit it’s 5 am
they really captured norman reedus’ sperglord energy
they really captured norman reedus’ sperglord energy
they really captured norman reedus’ sperglord energy
they really captured norman reedus’ sperglord energy
alright this game is the shit
map it all out
da map, da map
what are you making?
you’re working on swsw?
all the best games are walking sims
lmao
and from what i’ve heard it’s more than what it was marketed as
except it wasn’t marketed as anything but that
just like everyone has said it will be
it’s a walking simulator 
nothing 
on the other hand im currently loading up death stranding and im hype as fuuuck
* to schedule the meetings after the cancellings
and the company owner has been the one calling me to reschedule 
got all month to figure this out
but im not worried rly
:/
pushed back again
these tees are sick
but
i hate shopping 
as has been established on multiple occasions 
guten mong
guten mong
will do
but thurs
cause he got sick then i got sick
but our schedules have been kinda spotty
but he's been pretty adamant that i come in
thurs
and see what happens
i just gotta be honest as hell
ye me too
but an internship there pays better than whatever the fuck im doing rn
i'd probably be an intern
no clue
yuh same
l o l
a production company that my mom used to work at
in which case i'll just buy it for both of us
unless these picturemill guys hire me
and i won't for another few weeks
it
sadly, i don't have 10 bucks to drop on t
and i want to experience it very much, just to fuck with my already fucked head EVEN more
which as a concept is terrifying
but it's a strategy game revolving around global nuclear war
because there are no visually horrific images
technically it's not horror
is defcon
a horror game that we should definitely play
now that i think of it
OH
same
they got big drills man
so you gotta deal with them the old fashioned way which makes them difficult again
and even then you're like damn i really can't waste ammunition on them
when youre backtracking
until later
none of them are fodder
they're wandering around
and system shocks enemies aren't just flying at you screaming
it's brutal
like the only way i can make it through that game is by scumming with saves
mhm
yeah
orly?
i think it's a great game with cool shit and i like the big daddies and all. but it's not scary, so don't call it horror
i think it'd be more justified
like it really is
if bioshock was labeled as an action rpg
but bioshock is not a horror game
dead space is kinda like that but dead space gets away with it because of it's awesome shooting mechanics and it's insane gore
but most action horror games are challenging because you move really slow while enemies move really fast
just cause shit hits you hard
without feeling clunky
it's still really challenging
even though system shock gets kind of actiony later on
which was in my lifetime
everything past 3
cause resident evil is not horror. it's action horror.
most of all
i guess i just don't like the resident evil style horror
silent hills, great
mondo good
system shock
good
amnesia
but things like uh
just seeing the marketing for that game made me mad cause it looked so bad
fuckkin agony
or the ones that get a lot of marketing
like specifically the newer ones
i don't like most horror games cause most of them are kinda shitty
i think i made an unfair statement
okok
with actual people
and this is just big journey
i mean journey is one of my favorite games
but i love weird ass shit like this
just cause im not a huge horror game fan
and i kinda prefer this over pt
im thinking about it
actually
i will
yeah
...
except it's a triple a game by a studio with all the money in the world to throw at it
norman reedus ups simulator
the fact that it got made at all
imo
the game is like a goldmine
idk man
it's insane
and so stupid at the same time
he looks so serious
in your game and get away with it
how the fuck can you putdie-hardman
yeah man
who's wrong here?
sooooo
and all the bad reviews gave the new call of duty a 10/10
but all the good reviews say it's like nothing they've ever experienced before and it's amazing
i hope it turns out good
for some reason i got hyped enough about death stranding to preorder it
that said
got
just make the best of what we go
*do about it
cause their aint alll that much we two individual goofs can do it
which probably isn't the best convo fuel
and the people on it
idk im on a binge of thinking very pessimistically about the planet
stories, art, games, music
making intellectual stuff is cool though
aside from maybe space exploration. that hasn't stopped being cool.
it seems like no matter what we do physically, everything keeps sucking
yeah
absolutely not
do you really think i will think about the potential ramifications of making an artificial david lynch intelligence that wants to turn people into paste?
yeah but lets say im a closeted computer nerd who knows how to write code like a motherfucker but has no friends outside of 4chan and has never known the glorious touch of a bosom.
or something
unless you like the person
once you can have an ai do a person's job there's no reason to keep the person there
cause they're literally just trying to make people lose their jobs
though
whoever attempted it is a piece of shit
im sure
or make design choices
or like do intricate, detailed work
creative decisions
well i mean things that make
luckily there are no bots going into game design
fine
LOL
if you make a bot and someone sees your bot and thinks "i can do better than that" then boom you just inspired more bots
with shit that has the potential to spiral out of control like ai domination of any particular field. just being associated makes you part of it
you're kinda still responsible just for putting your hands in it
i'd do it but i'd do it for a percentage of profits
and that's a 1mil% gain
and that's a 1mil% gain
in less than 5 years
then they're gonna make 10mil off of it
cause if you sell that shit for 10
the bot's usefulness
and b
then you're undervaluing a- your usefulness
make the bot?
make a song?
i wouldn't
ez clap
wouldn't be more than 5 mil
wouldn't be more than 10 mil
could literally just use their spotify money to buy the rights to that thing
since there was already that study with the ai trying to find the "most pleasing song"
shit they could even be doing it now
and they'll keep making fake names for them
spotify's gonna have ais writing their piano songs soon
i bet
bruh
and they're a fake fuckin person
HAHAH
that made it
artist
lemme find the
i like this shit
hahaha
what the hell
with 6 million listens
with one song
valbona ceferin
holy shit
hfs lmao
all released in 2019
with 3 singles
sigrid vaas
i found one
peaceful piano?
ok
this has lyrics
no
lo-fi shit?
is it this 
oh
im just gonna chalk that up as another point in your book
so
i can't even load the page for chill
well
really
for it to be a piece of art i think there's gotta be a bit of meaning to it
idk
it's always been like background noise music that dudes on the internet pump out by the dozens to fill playlists
but that kinda music hasn't ever REALLY been real music
nvm, that's smart
right it's just a one time fee
for plays?
so ofc they're not actual bands
that sorta genre kinda started on youtube
well not that dumb
but the fact that they commission them themselves is kinda dumb
im trying to come up for an accurate description of them
mellow pop-tone drones?
or like
the vibe shit that's essentially just white noise
yeah that makes sense
oh
what?
needs to go
whoever is in charge of designing these shit playlists
to listen to songs from 2019
i don't click on blues or jazz roots
spotify kinda blows
and the actual size of their library
the playlist function
outside of like
bruh
lol hell yes
wow ending it on ini sounds not good
dankerino
waadigans are dankerini
same
so you’re fine
but it probably won’t need to be finished for another few coms
and you may or may not get more
you may or may not get everything you ask for
ye nw
it rly is
omg i didn’t even think of that
haha
i love to help when it comes to story stuff
always cool
yeye
:0
and ty
again nw mang
aight
yeee
but yes plz
sunday i work at 4
also imma start the new prog RIGHT now
hows swsw coming?
i always forget i have to do that
: p
: p
buuuut yea mang thats p gullible
im glad on a level that it worked
i just woke up
:0 
hell no, i dont have the self control for that
hope you got all ur nuts out
happy november 
but ye
not for another 45
also an oldie
he said sup prime corruption 
thats some oldie shit
yeah
was nice
he says wassup
nm i was carving pumpkins at eric’s place w milo a sec ago
doing anything for halloween?
nice tho
up
whats uo
happy halloween my g
wassup dog?
OIIIII
but more like those teenage anthem type bands like greenday, but with kkb-ish undertones
i finished the album its def not kkb 
ok
yeah its good
it reminds me of kkb but more edgy
i think you’d like
only 1 album so far so not much else to go off of tho
i just found em and they seem like they could be pretty good
you ever heard of glass beach?
oi
nice
howd all the essay writing go btw?
well whats up with you my man?
lmao
jfc amnesia is so good man
pastrami is like the cream of the crop when it comes to sandwich meats
idk what tf they’d put in there but that shit was so good
and id get pastrami ones
there was a jewish deli by my moms back in middle school that used to make these pita wrap sandwiches 
there was a jewish deli by my moms back in middle school that used to make these pita wrap sandwiches 
pastrami is a gift from yaweh
this shits delicious 
damn
and then the reuben comes in and its like
but only up front
it can be kind of overpowering 
at least for steaks and pork
which is slowly becoming my favorite condiment
it goes fuckin perfectly with horseradish 
but also
best sandwich 
i just found out that my dads bar in studio city makes a fucking mean reuben
are u fuckin kidding?
...
that cat looks incredibly unhappy 
probably best to leave it at that, he's not gonna top that one
the fact that within the first ten pages, dirk imposes himself as the narrator of the story, decides to get suggestions from the internet and is told to stop making homestuck is a fucking gold-tier joke
i can appreciate some of the humor in this reboot
lmao
ok
the china shop is impressionable youths with no identity
im gonna retract that statement about kanye fans if they wanna ride that wave they can
...
wait that's mean
his life is turning into the most fucked up rube goldberg of stupid shit
i gotta see kanye find his lord and savior jesus christ
oh YES
oh no
its just that you focus less on those lyrics and more on "i almost drowned in the pussy so i swam to her butt"
it's not uncommon for rappers to reference prayer and jesus and shit
technically
a lot of rap is christian
but i guess i will now
i wasn't gonna listen to it
awesome
fucking
i want my main character to be curbstomping goblins and thinking about his fuckin rent
now that's some shit i'd pay to see
adults who live normal lives that are thrust into crazy magical situations
now
it is
just copy homestuck
you wanna generate a massive internet following of tweenage girls and boys
powerpuff girl serum of fandoms
it's the fuckin
fandom generator
homestuck is literally like
that said, i appreciate andrew hussie's gif animations
that isn't beyond canon
definitely needs a new name or at least a sub title
yeah
what.
its like the seer without the way industrial bits
its kinda like
the album definitely has a lighter feel to it
i'll have to relisten
cause i can't quiiiite remember it
i'd say cathedrals of heaven is more between 8.5 and 9
actually
the nub is good too
sor the nub
not disc 2
only got to sunfucker though
which is ridic
but so far there hasn't been anything below like a 9
i didn't finish the album on my way home from work last night
amneisa is fucking in sane
my man this song is some shit
sunfucker my guy
or death folk
maybe dark folk
actually it kinda reminds me of sacrificial cake, just in terms of feel
idk if i’d call this folk
wtf
bruh
fkin leaving meaning?
title song?
amnesia? fuck
fuckin amnesia my man
hanging man my guy
hanging man?
leaving meaning is a proper swans album
idk wrf your talkin bout
oh sickkk
well that's fine
oh
gonna get to that now
holy shit i never downloaded the swans leak
it's ridiculous
fuckin sick songs
ya mang
some of the short drones are the best
i mean
lmao
it is
yeah
just for basededness
probably prisoner in your skull
and its rly hard to still name a favorite anymore
looking at the tracklist rn
well shit
ye ye
lmao
way unexpected
animus and the sound is
yum yab didnt grow on my until i heard it on the jarboe album
wo
that’s honestly understandable 
fuckin a c e s
has he compiled his thoughts on it?
holy fuk
sounds like your schedule is fucked you may want that time for other things
lmao don’t worry too much about it
rest in peace man, good luck there
wait thats fucked
ay no worries my guy
any monad peeps currently on the godhead are welcome
you can join it if you want
prep on the next prog is completed
arright
i know what i forgot
i know what i forgot
i never tested swsw for you
 ay
*gnight
gmight
yeye no prob
hows the crew?
a lil late, phones not notifying me for some dam reason
oh can you tell em i say hi?
or is the party part over and you’re in the wind down part?
who you drinking with?
yeye
easily the best juice, best citrus fruit in general 
that stuff is insane when it’s super fresh
compared to really fresh grapefruit juice
the problem is all the pasturized florida’s natural grapefruit juice that you find in stores SUCKS
and you’re right about grapefruit 
good aj is the shit
morning, afternoon, right before bed, it doesn’t matter 
i can guzzle that shit all day
bruh i started hitting the lemonade too young 
so it's hard
and im a fiend for lemonade
apple, orange, lemonade
possibly
i haven't decided
and then hit taco zone for a buritto
heading home boutta stop and stock up on some juice
im good
niice
hows it going?
and fucking delicious
and he makes it look kind of easy?
makes shit that is doable
unlike babish
this guy
i don't think i shared this guy with you
oh
when you’re done lemme know how you wanna build Zeiat for combat?
coo coo
sounds good
oh lmao ok
hell yea
i was gonna wait since it wasn’t full
whole album?
oh hell yea
but it's done.
that was a fucking long prologue
good night sweet prinse
you sleep
shit right
v different feelings
also is this american folk or european?
gira doesn’t strike me as the type
how is gira folk?
i guess?
thats cool
huh
thats nice though
yeah i don’t like singles that much
damn
i was holding off till the album
i didn’t 
oh
ic
ty
s i c k
what kinda mellow?
swans album though
ok
but i spent my bi-monthly movie allowance on this
parasite looks rly good
yeah i feel
and the girl sounded like super genuinely scared when he was in her house
the reveal was really well handled
and from then on it just got worse
that part fucked me up
yeah
its weird
but can definitely recognize 
which i love
like too sad
it just took it too far
it is
yeah
10/10 don’t watch it
hard triggered my depression though
fuckin
a fucking fantastic movie
its really good like
ye
just got out
i literally just saw joker
how was it?
that’s just the case
in fact 
im just assuming that’s the case
than i did
im sure they needed it more
so like
i assume they were cracked out and probably homeless 
yeah
its true
but it’s LA at like 2 am. i literally cannot expect any better
yeah
100% my fault 
i was taking the bus home, fell asleep on it. Woke up, it was gone
uhhh scraps of weed lmao
some cards that i’d left in there
a couple lousy tips and children of dune
nothing 
no sunday night
backpack got stolen like just last night and im doing everything i can to not think about it
my fuckin
boutta head home once i charge my phone
literally just got off work
wassup with you?
yuh
kisket
i honestly think kate’s playlist is my best one after kiske
its been far too long since i’ve listened to hacker
dude
yuh
wo dude i think i dropped stone cold asleep like right there
yeah exactly 
then its just a speed running trick that you’re helping facilitate 
true true
ngl it kinda destroys the platforming
you don’t have to cause
thatd be sick
if there was a way to consistently rocket off the walls though
and just kep clicking left, right, left, left, right, left, left, right, etc
so you call your sword mid dash and throw it again
i still think the optimal way to go fast is to alternate your clicks really quickly 
friday is best
ok
it does
yesss
whyd you change it like that?
what?
always down
tf is that?
arc 16 being the one that made me lose my shit a few weeks ago
it would be tho
arc 17 of ward is even better than arc 16
Oh my god
and itll be sick
when i get a new job and start making the good $$ imma get a big single apt and we can hang there
c o m e   b a c k
come back
miss you guys too
ya, same
ohh

holy fuck
...
pretty cool
q tip is
ok cool
so not sure
i still haven’t listened to combat
dirty laundry and savage nomad
same
i didn’t memorize the names
uh
a bad album on its own
a bad album on its own
its not
k m s
fucking
for like 3 days
I LISTENED TO AE TO PREP
I CANT
its soft :(
compared to atrocity exhibition
k
and then staying up till 4 cause i have no bed in my room
eating that
so imma be
i just got a bomb ass burrito at 11:30 pm
ye so lemme know what you think
just that i think itd be more fun for me if you saw a bit of my hand first 
not that you shouldn’t be shooting for a heads 4
the outcome of this decision can make things better or worse for us in the near future 
i won’t tell you what either side of the scale represents 
coin flip is, who walks away happiest, number is by what margin
we’ll just say that
4 is not a very polarizing number
but the coin flip stays
if you want to change the number you can
didn’t wanna just decide it myself 
outcome of the prog
could be coming sunday 
def could be worse 
saturday 
it comes
hard inted that one
nah she ran it down
l m a o
rn she’s in new zealand 
except 
current one
no, her own
ty for the numbers, very helpful 
yeaaaaa....
that cool naturalpath thing
organic fibers amd stuff
and i cannot pay for an organic bed
my mom wanted organic 
but
i could have done it myself 
upon hearing that
reaction 
my exact
literally 
and sent it to san francisco 
my mom ordered it through some site she found
good number
after that, hit me with a number between 1 and 10
and then tell me the result
hey man do me a favor and flop a coin for me
fuck shit
fuck
my bed didn’t come
yuh
yep
but i cashed out on my desk watching youtube videos so all in all not too bad
xd
sleeping on bedframe slats is the worst and there rly aint enough floorspace
nah i meant it pretty literally 
obviously 
the hoeing myself was a meme
idk i drank a ton so i’ll probably just try and sleep in my chair
yeh
not even home so it’s not that applicable yet
but not rly
well yeah
any ideas?
ehhhhh
but
i could hoe myself out maybe 
so i don’t have to sleep on the floor
tryna figure out what to do instead of sleep
no bed in my room again
alright 
nail on the head
that doesn't make sense
yes right on the nail
:O
i don'y see the comparison but i believe it's right
lmao
yeah
fucking
didn't get enough sleep last night
but nah
i wanted to finish this tonight
ok im fuckin tired fuck
fufckassakfn
im having an existential crisis about soup
oh my god she's a genius
oh my god
omg
wait this chick is onto something
wait this chick is onto something
she's a fucking genius
they're optimal
mathed potatoes man
and found this
immediately after the first break
i took a second break
now im good
ok had to pause to watch a movie
vibe check
aight
lmao
solid defense bro
ofc noah would do that in his sleep
l o l
oh he drums right?
is noah in the band?
what’s cookin
sah dude
v good
yeh
i think
im just gonna chill
Thank you, family, bless 🙏🙏
completely agree
this week we get to see how hard i can kill them with prep
and horus always wins
cause the pc abilities turn combat into a game of who can pull the stupidest shenanigans 
fun to play for me even with no prep
it is very cool
and apparently everyone in my group loves the system 
i also got to run a game of lancer on sat
oh!
still p cool
yeah
not risks in terms of storytelling or anything 
specifically risks in terms of what they put on the screen 
and it had the balls to take risks
just surprisingly dark
wasn’t specifically well written or anything 
that show was good
that show was good
though, the boys came close
tv can’t punch your brain in the gut like a good Wheel Barrow story can
tv sucks
the first chapters are just getting rewritten too so its not as cheesy 
but yea if you’re on the subway and you’re thinking you want some shit to do, seriously check it out
and it fucked me up for a long while
book 1 is incredibly good too
like holy shit
book 2 pt 16
It takes all of its most inconsistent elements and brings them together in a way that is so well put together it blows my mind
so good
so fucking crazy 
the latest chapter is
which I recommend you read last year
which is the second book after Worm
the latest chapter of Ward
just gonna throw this in here
also
Ye
sounds like early christmas 
i get a danny album AND i get paid on friday?
i prefer millennial and gen x slang
Gen Z terminology doesn’t agree with me on a physical level man
i suppose ur right
l o l
wtf
arent bruh moments supposed to be bad?
quite a hype moment 
yuh yuh
boutta move in tmrw
also just got the keys to my new place
yeah
:)
so i think it’s all good
She was quite happy 
:|
Just gave cleo to my aunt 
lying
even
he wasnt
omg
hahaha
pretty starved for brain cells in general
kanye fans are
yeah
well
went full dumbass
terrandc
its cursed as hell
what could possibly sadden you of the inverse nipple-baby/ baby-nipple duo?
also
with completely different people
in a completely different video
from the kyle video
the same spot
i found
yup
k
k
gonna see if i can move in there before friday, but it sorta depends on how nice this old asian lady who owns it is
very pleased 
and then im checking out a nice affordable room in ktown at 7
ye
i fuckin forgot it there on saturday and im fuckin miffed
at the very least, no work means i can go to studio city and get my check
im kinda glad
lmao
that’s actually the worst advice i’ve received all year. Well played .
...
got to work and realized that i wasn’t on the schedule 
fuuuuuck
but rent aint cheap
i’ll try
nice
got the full suite
well you’re fuckin lucky
based red
based
thats p big
thats p big
:0
how expensive?
but sick if bangers were played and good times were had
yeah seems less than ideal seated
venue packed?
how was that?
king crimson?
he doesn’t 
nah
and youd take damage if you chose the wrong ones
you were given options 
uh
yep good times
it had a bit of combat that i broke 15 ways
idk a kid and his talking sword friend
he asked me to playtest
this was like last year
at usc
a light novel game with his girlfriend 
eric was making like
thats what i do to yours, eric’s and soon jonah’s 
idk, i think the point of testing a game is to do your dambdest to break the thing
eh
did he play it slow the first time?
gabe is a cultured man i see
nice
nivr
gabe the teacher?
complete bumrush go as fast as possible
what one of two people who plays it like this
cause im like
don't listen to me
*it
if it comes down to me
well
third big guy chase actually
where you gotta get him out of his hole
that and the second big guy chase
yeah
in lvl 2
and another where you're encouraged to
and i think there is one time where you kinda have to stop
yeah true
oh hell yea
but touching the wasd keys
maybe not touching the ground
or hm
if it was possible to beat every level without touching the ground or stopping
would be sick
i think swsw
essentially what im saying is
and you kinda have that rn
or like its easy to choose between one or the other
and you can stay in control, but its hard to do that too
i like it when you can go fast but it's hard to keep going fast
so
lemme just preface this by saying my favorite movement in any game is titanfall 2
ok well
so it's not like unfriendly to noobs
but even then you slide down the wall pretty slowly
maybe a tiny hop so you stay suspended where you are when you let go of the sword
i just think you need skillful ways to preserve your boost momentum
you don't need a wall jump in a game where you can literally fly
you don't need a wall jump in a game where you can literally fly
awwww
waaaaaaaat
instead of letting yourself touch the wall.
cause so far i noticed that it happens if you pick up the sword right as you touch the wall
the flying off of walls?
have you figured out how to reproduce it?
it makes rocketing off walls easier?
so basically
need hands on demonstration
my brain not big enough
im gonna have to play it to see
ok i don't know how that works
but it doesn't return as fast?
so you get to throw it as soon as you touch the sword
oh i see
ok i've gotta see
does it force you to hold?
so it's faster?
that also means you can't go fast
i liked spam
why?
wait really?
cool
?
oh you're doin the swsw art/
to your app library
but discord will say you're playing microsoft word if you have it connected
yeah lmao
as if it's a game
you're playing it
discord is saying
yeah
wtf is asperite?
today was the first session of a side arc with different characters in a differnet part of the world
that parsa and i joined
one that one of the dudes i brought in from reddit to eric's campaign started
well
yeah
yeh
so i missed it
the good dnd group had to reschedule to today while i was at work
it's been ass
uhhhhhhhh how's your day been?
responded to the same exact comment that i already responded to
wait im rarted lol
this is very true
not necessarily best ever made but i cannot think of anything remotely negative to say
flawless song
^
literally no further than white chain
look
if you're lookin for monk shit to redesign the player character in swsw
im stupid as hell
actually
(noworries)
good dreams my mans
aight
yeah i love that one
he's also got some weird ass body horror shit
dali's art is arty af
that's pretty cool though
vruh dali is dadaist
wait how?
sounds cool
yeah that does make it better
yeah that would
a checkpoint at the sword?
very nice
or nah
can you make the buttons rebindable?
space isn't bad
yikers
cause clicking will be kinda
can you assign a button solely to going through text boxes or smth?
is there dialogue?
is there dialogue?
or at least npc's spewing info at you
somehow
that's gotta be in the game
fantastic
polloctopus
niiice
how was ur day man?
lmao
until she gets a gf or something
complete social bool
very cool, very anxious
yep the kisket monologue
but maybe i amplify her boolishness
it'll probably be exactly the same as rp kisket
gotta figure out how she's gonna sound
from first person pov
yeah
next chapter is a kisket perspective
but yeah
yea
too bad people have bad taste
its still good
yes
it rly is
indianna jones had a better grasp
scientists, with no concept of the laws of physics
for the point to come across
where they ran in a straight line
but i probably spent too much time dissing the one scene
i think i heard you said you liked it once, and thought i said i liked it too
you didn't?
bruh david as the main character would have made it perfect
agreed
and that's what matters
it's all fucking gross and stressful
the plot who gives a fuck
i like prometheus. it gets the tone down pat
so everything is just that much worse
everyone's tripping balls
but
prometheus
same i kind of imagined it like
i particularly like veruvi as a villain. glad you made those choices
yeah me too
in later ones, kisket will learn to talk to plants and stones and fling them around with her mind and shit. and Tracy will become a bounty hunter gangster chasing down the serial killer who killed his friend and mentor
but like this is the first book
they're better characters imo
maybe a small part
but not this anymore
v's a big part of the rp
very very far
and yeah
so T, a couple big lugs, and this archeologist asshole have to fight their way through swarms of rabid cave dogs, angry, blood sucking cave bats, and a planet that wants to splatter them across the ground to find this artifact.
Tracy meanwhile finds out the archeologist was lying, about being in contact with the ship, drags him back at gunpoint and forces him to rat himself out, and earns himself some food. But the ship is heavily damaged and won't come pick them back up unless there's a very good reason to, like the mission being completed or something
so eventually kisket gives in and eats some shit and suddenly she feels the rocks and the plants and the animals speaking to her and guiding her on an intense quest, guided by the planet and a few cave mice to find herself and maybe help the planet with some huge issue it seems to be having but can't tell her about.
kisket and tracy, puny humans that they are get the boot
so the big protector guys, who really don't wanna trip balls in these tunnels filled with shit that wants to eat them start hoarding the food and portioning it out to those they see fit
the archeologist leader tells them they're getting an evac in two weeks, but the team of 10-12 has enough food for 6 of them for that time.
and they soon find out that all the flora and fauna are basically filled to the brim with lsd and psilocyben
so they're stuck down there.
they go to this planet get in the tunnels, and then the ship gets hit by a flash storm, and causes a cave-in while heading back out to orbit
yeh
They go to a planet, currently unnamed, that's filled with deep tunnels with glass ceilings. The insides of the tunnels are like massive greenhouses, filled with wildlife and shit
so Tracy joins an excavation crew to fly to distant planets and unearth alien artifacts, and kisket's hired to record the whole thing for the newspapers.
have no money
so Tracy and Kisket, one being a dumbass rich kid who's never worked a day in his life, and the other being a writer who struggles to find work
and the only human assets really worth anything are knowledge and skills.
basically, humanity is very new to monad
and so unhappy poor people can't do the same
yeah
ye
cause of translator implants blocking neural pathways
but you won't be able to say it
well yeah
and you have to call me an amphiron
if you're an amphiron, and im a human, i gotta call you a human
so for instance
so all aliens are to be treated as members of one another's species, and the word alien has literally been removed from people's speech
but i changed the identity around a bit to be about unity between species
so there's Monad still
aight
though i am still liquidating assets
it's not at all similar to the rp anymore
have i told you the basic outline?
it's def still scifi
*which
but he still sounds like a whiny bitch whitch is good
i kinda had to redevelop tracy's voice
and it's sick
and then finished the first chapter of my book today
i ended up dropping some of the acid i had last night
v nice
is good inspiration 
literally any absolver art
and yeah
why monk?
same with japan i think
well cause they legit believed their emperor was an embodiment of one of their gods
ye
yea, esp in china or smth
yep
in popular fiction 
that coined the term god-emperor
not warhammer
it was dune
and to top it off
also there are like 6 books and im just starting the second
and probably has some good material for inspiration down the line
very detailed
dunes very good
but yeag
he straight died six times and nobody can tell me he didn’t 
max actually living through that movie 
aside from you know
mad max is the best cause it throws caution to the wind and just makes the most ridiculous shit humanly possible 
yep
i can’t give the last example without spoiling shit and i think you should read/watch it without knowing too much about what happens
if you cut out all the interior monologues then the dialogue will sound fuckin stupid and all the action will just be people cutting each other up with knives. It’ll be intense, cause its a knife fight, but not because its a knife fight where both participants are incredibly skilled and are constantly calculating their opponents next moves
so all there is to make the movie on is the dialogue and the action bits
like any movies
which never happens in movies
and the amount of information that the viewer has means that for the most part, they’re on the exact same page as all the characters in the story
in book form it reads like a very slow play where nothing is hidden from the viewer aside from whatever is gonna happen next
without it being fuckin boring
which is impossible to do in a movie 
dune is told in third person omnicient
cause of the perspective 
its gonna suck compared to the book
problem is
same
well they’re making it now to release in 2020
they’re gonna make it again in 2020 btw
was the og one supposed to be good or smth 
so like i don’t expect anyone to read it
dune is a big ass book tho
and then lynch made the movie instead?
yea
but a dune movie did get made
cause i haven’t seen the dune movie
no
very good
the second one
i did that and read dune
but that was pretty much all the important shit i did today
ye
same but i just bottle bottle bottle it up like a fuckin man
literally impossible to find affordable housing without
well it needs to happen so im not too upset 
getting all her shit together and giving her a bath
so i was prepping cleo to give to my aunt
i had the day off
it has
 yeah
noah still hasn’t listened to sftb?
ttyl
oh
also aint it 2 in the morning for you?
yuh
go on way too long
and nobody respects the active frames on all her smashes for some reason
ez money
you just sit back spam b and then kick them in the fuckin nuts when they come close
zelda is fuckin op
but i never play him
the third most mainish dude i got is prob ike
not main
most characters i play for fun
i couldn’t figure out a third
zelda dedede and
hmm
big characters just dom
and now like
tru
its funny that they gutted everyone that was good in smash 4
i think its hilarious
sheik is the worst
yep
nobody gives a shit about that weeb garbage now that they suck
or bayonetta
like sheik
it wouldn't bother me that he's anime if he was bad
it bothers me that he's anime and good
i wanna see how they handle the new guy
joker is broken, hero is broken, banjo is   u n g i m p a b l e
i gotta play more banjo
idk
id
you see that shit and you don't pick it you're a pussy and that's that
same with kamikaze
so w/e
but you're not a man if you don't pick it
like  half the time you just kill yourself
cause it's just retarded
but i think im okay with hocus pocus existing in its current form
hocus pocus is hocus brokus
kills at 0
snooze
thwack's hitbox is fucking massive and it kills at 45
some of the menu options are fucked
that said
agreed
especially online
so why play the game when your opponent can just play hero
or counterplay
doesn't have a niche
who
and then they made hero as the second dlc character
they have all these great characters with niches and counterplay
here's my problem with smash rn
like
that's fucked
ungimpable
damb
rly?
WAT?
oh
yeah but why not just use charizard if you wanna side b
and the bombs are stuuupid
but you only get 5 stacks
fkn kills you at 0
that's what all of his everything does
he kills you
or hero
like dedede
i like straightforward characters
idk man i don't get him
banjo
yeye
work gay but i need money
book good came up with an ending and a lil prologue to get things rolling
but
you’re gonna have to 1v1 me smash sometime soon
freed schedule eh?
rly
oh
i came up with a name for the first part
books good
or are they letting you just go to town on swsw
for game dev?
any new projects man?
yuh
yuh
haven’t listened to the glowing man enough tbh
actually the glow pt 2 as well
court of the crimson king and disappeared behind the sun are the only ones i can agree with there
you kinda thought of a lot
i didn’t get these until jst now sor
who ate them
what you up to?
lmao
top tier ice cream flavor
ye it is
lol
so theres no real drawbacks
he can just make a fuckin giant ass shake with the outsides
and honestly 
mad respect 
same
yeah
that's some fuckin CHONK
shit man
yea
he's so faaat
wtf
yeah thats what i said too
lmao
something to wake up to
so now im inspired 
cause its coming p soon
that had been keeping me up at night
made the one playlist
imma finish the current prologue 
also if you have no problems with it
honestly the more conceptual julia holter gets the better she is
i think
shiiiiit
fuck man, this is what i needed to round out the next playlist
but loud city song is a fucking top of it's class album
and i don't like those as much
all her high rated shit are the popish ones
i never took a deep look cause
were so fuckin good
why didn't you tell me julia holter's older albums
bruh
need em
and i will attempt the same
aight get the good z’s man
ok
sunday i can probably bool in the morning 
cause he’s an fps normiefag
probably aaa
and nope
cause major swap into game dev
is repeating a grade xd
forgot that jonah
OH
oh
junior year
ya
feels like its been 3 weeks
how u been
lmao
:0
:¥
:0
was like, “tf you looking at, motherfuker?”
bruh that last squirrel 
yeye
*camp
i got put on it cause i bought some of their shit off bandcamo
xd
young god records sent me a preorder email
saw that
and oh shit cool
agreed
they’ve gone too far
jfc man
idk a lotta stuff 
and it's dope
he makes food from movies
yea
prolly
check him out
if you wanna make food
so
binging with babish
also i learned pretty much everything i know from this bald youtube guy
and everything will taste good from then on out
cause it’ll accumulate like bits of fond and starch and onion flavor 
to season the pan itself
and sometimes bacon
you gotta spend like the first week cooking potatoes and onions in it
so with a brand new pan
that you got?
is the pan brand new?
thats true
yes
Xd just looks so stupid 
but xd and its variations are pretty strong
since their conception
and most other twitch chat terminology 
i’ve hated pog
milo rubbed off on me
i gotta stop saying that shit
i don’t go into detail
xd not rly
season your shit
cast iron pans are the best
you getting into cooking?
oh cast iron?
did you just buy it?
just unholstered frying pan?
xd
hmm
wish i wasn’t caught up with ward now that woulda been helpful
cause i don’t have anything drowning out the outside sounds 
as hard
i just can’t zone out
nah not that
on public transport 
i forgot my headphones at home and i gotta make it to sm and back
fuuuuuuck
Science!
ah no its still retarded
wtf
skype isn’t putting periods
We all were
didn’t put the period though 
that was a skype auto response 
I have two
probably 
he’s an old boy
my uncle michael’s dog buster
cause i can’t go after work
need to run to santa monica to walk/feed a dog then be back by 5 to work
sauce fuck
i just knew zero and shofu
milo would
wait wtf
cause otherwise i may actually know who these guys are 
its too bad i pay no attention to competitive smash
hes p fuckin funny lol
who was much longer than that
especially compared to six seconds
his was rly short
i found him
whoops
did he i found jwittz
huh
i could not find jwittz
to the point where im like wtf
a lotta them autotuned the fuck out of themselves 
cause it was getting too long
i had to stop after chillin and d1
hahaha
of people speaking english 
its just a normal video
whats your hing?
with chillin
i think its corneria
and that’s pretty dope to
whoever made that made the one right after too
it sounds like it was recorded through fuckin apple headphones
yeah actually 
right after him
is fucking sick
that norfair beat
but
he’s the only one so far who isn’t autotuned to shit
lmfao
HOLY SHIT zero
no
yea
lmao
ya
talking about a cursed rope we found in the first session
Kevin P. (GM): "The real curse was the friends we made along the way."
Fucking Degenerate: "We've made no friends."
and then on the last night you just go hog wild
*game
everything you say for the rest of the gmae
then everyone ignores
and then you random lynch a townie and say you won as exe
where you just stay home every night
and i like to play my patented sleeper werewolf
i like sk in all any too
its so dumb
or avoid you for the rest of the game and then you just stall them out and kill them in the end
and people will either swarm you n1
just say exactly what you are
mhm
which means it's perfect
it's literally the most caveman brain role
veteran
ez
so feels real bad
but didn't get ret
i did bool a few games on tos after you brought it up
i c
oh
10 mins
but i can be playing tos in like
for my troubles 
and phone died
found nothing 
 i was out looking for bday presents for my stepmom
im not playing town of salem
this kid is crossing up all the fifth graders at ymca
rocco’s becoming a tricky mf in his basketball games
and parsa that
meant to send you this
im ret
from the time i went to the range with him a few years ago
but i know he’s a pretty good shot with a handgun
but i know he’s a pretty good shot with a handgun
*which
i would too
whicj
i mean for most cases hed probably just grab a shotgun and point it in the right direction 
idk
like i guess if you decide you need some handheld american security in your new york apt my dad can help you pick something out
like i guess if you decide you need some handheld american security in your new york apt my dad can help you pick something out
a fucking massive snipper rifle too
guns bullets knives and two crossbows
so like wtf are they gonna do about it
and people just deal with it cause he owns the bar they drink at
nah he brings it up every chance he gets
i thought i told you
hes our crazy bastard
but uh
otherwise he’s just a crazy bastard
id probably go to his house
like should the apocalypse come and everything becomes fuckin fallout or smth
and the shits decked out
i used to call it a gun cabinet but now its more like a war room
i saw his uh
still prepping for the end of the world
still a flat earther
and he’s doing about as well as he ever does
but in a pretty alright way
he’s nuts
its cool working at some place that i have a vested interest in
yea
yuh
so i can wreck the system from the inside 
kotaku
im thinking of looking for copy editor positions at like
at least until i get a better position/more hours there
but i could always use more money
i will
yea
i say 7-3 cause 9-5 is laaame
i say 7-3 cause 9-5 is laaame
to get me up early 
a 7am-3pm job
i think i just need like
but as soon as the schedule is flexible im fucked
i’m pretty much never late for work or work appointments 
it’s weird 
my motivation problem doesn’t exist when i have things i need to do
but like
literally motivated by his parents 
jonah is
so rly im just tryna look out for milo
in fact in my book it would be cooler
roaming with jonah would be cool
so basically he needs to get his shit in gear if he doesn’t wanna be in my situation 
but if it doesn’t happen in a year than im more likely to get a place with jonah
i think it could happen eventually 
dunno if he’s gonna move out though
i could split a single with him
and miles is an enigma
michael is probably moving to seattle with his boyfriend 
not sure if its happening
nice ye
will probably set something up like that when i get a new place 
either way i’ll be out of my dads house p soon so
yea
so kinda scuffed
no outlets on the other side of the room though
may do that
that’s pretty smart
and then i get up at 11:45
and then without fail i go and either fall back asleep or stare at my phone or smth till 11
my internal clock wakes me up at 8:45 without fail
the problem is that i don’t even realize it happened until after
maybe
mhm
yeh
yeh
ridiculously hard time getting up
just have a
just mornings when i don’t have shit to do till like noon or 3
tbh its never rly nights
for sure
so i think for the time being im gonna stick to the rampant alcoholism
and i’ve been much more depressed than usual
so for the past 2 weeks i haven’t been drinking much
i think that was some of the best ironic usage of bruh moment i’ve heard so far
whassup with you?
it is
good man
good man
that'll clear u out
eat some fiber
cheetos oreos and beef jerky sounds like constipation material
the combination
but i think the problem was more
that's pretty saucy man
all summer you didn't eat junk food?
atomized
gone
just
completely annihilated that mans
fucking
it was good
and
this week parsa just did a intro thing for if he were to take over
but he'd see how every other week turned out and that he was just burnt out
and then that he didn't really want to do it at all
and then that he only wanted to do every other week
he said he couldnt make this week
um not entirely sure
but parsa is a very good dm
not to throw shade at milo
and
then parsa took over dming for milo
was at work
nm man
wassup

voli best waifu
true
wtf is that shit dudr
just run the enemy down and smack the fuck outta them
voli top, mid, jungle, adc, and supp
and im having the most fun i’ve ever had with the game
*volibear
and just playing bolibear
but im playing on a smurf account 
tft got me playing league of legends again
fucking
also
yeh
im boutta miss my stop
wow this bus is hauling fucking ass
thoughts were sculpted 
i think that respect convo was a quality one
im sure its fine
lol im jk
shit
shoulda said that on my first tirade
 now i feel like a dumbass
well
oh
of respecting and trusting 
or for me, meeting someone who i think is worth the effort 
who doesn’t do things that you don’t respect 
meeting someone who you do respect 
the problem in the end is wanting the right thing
mhm
* charming
nina is charmibg
yeah
and that sets off a chain of reactions because you don’t pretend to like people
so it’s pretty easy to lose respect 
i c
thats the kicker yeah
i forgot to add you also need the balls to ask a girl out and the willpower to laugh off a shit test without getting self-conscious 
actually 
in the modern age
thats my working theory on how to get and keep a girlfriend 
and we can literally get anything and anyone we want whenever 
then we win
while also being a big fuckin man who doesn’t take shit from anyone 
if we can identify what a girl wants, and then provide that
whether that be fucking them senseless, undying love, financial stability, appreciation of their body and their sexuality, or respect.
girls need men to give them what they want
not necessarily 
girls don’t need men to respect them
i guess what im trying to say is
so fuckin funny
we have the sane methods with different ideology 
i don’t respect anyone but i treat them like they’re worthwhile
it’s definitely a wording difference then
ok
unless they prove to be worthy of your respect 
because you’re smarter than them and its a waste of your time
don’t listen to anything anyone says
and more
don’t let people affect you
but idk what im getting at is less
so i think i read shouldn’t in your response when it wasn’t there
also im pretty drunk
im saying that outside opinions are worthless and you should ignore everything i say
im saying they don’t 
im not saying they shouldn’t 
i think that is a strength that is worth learning and it’s why i said bad idea
or when whoever says whatever their opinions mean nothing 
thats why i didn’t get upset when eric or whoever else used to call me a nigger.
until i decide someone means something to me, they mean nothing, and their words and actions hold no power
so like
so in general i don’t judge people on how they act towards me
so in general i don’t judge people on how they act towards me
a wide array
i judge them based on how they act towards others
trying to do that in this world would drive me insane 
and i can’t expect anyone to care about any words that come out my mouth 
is that i cannot expect anyone to respect me or my ideas
what im getting at
like
yeah
and nobody is gonna be hitler
so nobody is gonna be ghandi
but i think my expectations for how people will act has to be tempered by how people exist 
i guess my standards are too high
so
every other person who thinks they’re good ought to be comparing themselves to that
or mlk
ghandi or buddha
for me a truly good person worthy of respect is like
but good is different from being decent which is different from being average, or bad or evil.
a good person at their weakest will still do what they believe is rught
and don’t make excuses based on the situation or scenario
who don’t justify 
are the ones who, at their best and their weakest are true to themselves and others
is that i think good people
i guess what in getting at
so
at 25% battery
my phone is gonna die again soom
you’re probably a piece of shit just like me.
*ahead
you decide to lie cheat and decieve in order to get aheaf
if at your weakest
i think a person’s badness or goodness is most easily examined in their moments of weakness
i only ever did it because it was easier than actually dealing with the situation on hand
i can only speak from personal experience as a liar, cheater, thief, etc
also my phone dies for a bit there sorry for dropping out
whoops
:)
is almost always to make any situation easier
which at least from my experience 
because of the intention behind the act
nah i think the acts are inherently bad
so like
even people who sound and look secure
everyone is insecure 
but everyone gets jealous everyone cheats at some point, everyone lies, everyone breaks laws, does drugs, bends rules, and does what the fuck ever for the sake of convienence
i just believe that bad people that don’t do bad shit are better, and therefore are good
i don’t believe in good people 
wo lag
oh
what you say about allison
but as long as you dont act on it you’re a good person 
you can think the worst things imaginable
idk i think thoughts and actions are completely separate 
well
imo i think that’s called being a decent man
for you respect is offering a person the decency that for any decent person is deserved, right?
yeh
a whiiiile back
what i said
thats
but you put the effort in to respect them before they give you that reason
which is why i reacted so quickly and vehemently 
i don’t think most people are deserving of your trust or your respect 
but that’s because i think its a bad idea for me
honestly i do think its a bad idea for uti
well
ahh
1st me is you or 2nd me is you?
wait which is the you
yeah
why does it matter if someone respects your opinion though
yeah
your phrase has the core concept “i disagree, but its okay”
the core idea is “i disagree”
i mean its an added comment but the idea is the same
so its the phrasing
i was only reacting to a specific comment 
kinda taking it real far imo
thats
also hfs lmao
why is offering an unsolicited opinion disrespectful 
rq
hol up a minute 
ok
i don’t 
i didn’t see that
i guess
but i would accept it and i wouldn’t be an asshole about it
but i would accept it and i wouldn’t be an asshole about it
if jonah or milo decided to do it i wouldn’t respect them for it
like i respect you for deciding to move to ny after college
but you’re closer and you have a give and take of influence between yourself and the respected individual because of that closeness
but you’re closer and you have a give and take of influence between yourself and the respected individual because of that closeness
respect is like admiration
respect is something that is backed by trust and action
but for me
unless you decide that a specific person is more worthy of your own respect than you are
i think you should respect yourself more than you respect anyone else
and even expected of pretty much everyone
but also perfectly fine for any person to do
i think that’s true
ok
but i also think theres a huge divide between treating someone with respect and treating someone with decency or compassion 
i said “bad idea” because i think the respect until proven unworthy method is like, kinda nuts
specifically 
and that help lead to greater mutual understanding 
because those are the only options that keep the discussion going
double down or ask why
i really have two options in that case scenario 
getting offended wouldn’t serve me
“dude you’re retarded”
if you were to say to me something like
because i don’t care enough to offer them anything 
i wouldn’t say anything at all
with most other people 
but in any other case
the point is to not take these things personally 
it’s respect because im sharing my opinion of your opinion
because i respect your opinions for what they are to you, rather than what they might be to me.
so your beliefs and your world truths don’t need to conform with mine
i also don’t necessarily believe that you need to believe the same thing
generally
and i believe it’s true of the world 
i believe it
i answered before i said that
im just saying most people because it’s true
no
if you respect everyone, then what’s the difference?
and a proving of worth 
just that there needs to be a sort of process
that doesn’t mean it needs to be hard to earn
most people believe that respect needs to be earned from others
just as your beliefs are tfue of ypurs
well my beliefs are true of my world
same as trust
respect is something that must be earned
and they spend alot of time and effort hiding those things 
most likely they’ve already done things that would make you not respect them
bad idea
then i guess where we differ is on the definition and contextual weight of respect 
the only ny person that i can be sure you respect tbh is claire
do you really respect them at all?
but like if you don’t have a definitive reason for respecting someone, and you don’t stick to that idea
cause i can respect his work ethic and his effort to conform his personality to his environment 
i don’t hold any respect for anyone from santa monica save for you and possibly milo
people don’t respect one another 
unless they’re equals in some way
people don’t respect each other
the reality is that in general 
it can be done and can be done successfully 
which like
then your actions have to be measured to account for their opinions and their viewpoints 
if you’re worried about whether the people you like like you back
i think
that is the problem 
and if not than just do whatever you want 
if not then i guess you’re more like me than i thought 
so long as your own happiness is a priority to you
but what she thinks of you should be much less important than what she is and what she does
you should respect your girlfriend, because you don’t want to be hitched up with anyone who doesn’t meet your standards, and respect is a good measure for that.
as a man, you shouldn’t need your girlfriend to respect you
because the more important that is to you the easier it is for any person to control you
you should try to not rely on other people’s respect in order to feel good about your self and your life
im just saying
ok
but that is essentially the male role of the future
wow i can’t believe that came out of my mouth
ok
and im satisfied with that
i just give love to women who need it, when they need it
im not in any relationship 
when democracy, radical feminism, and technology win this stupid political fight
20 years from now
im mostly talking about say
this topic isn’t necessarily based in the current time
we have under different contexts
they just desire men from time to time
because we live in a reality where women do not need men
as a man, your girlfriend/wife will inevitably have power over your time, your money, your quality of living, and your relationships
you want to put them in a position of power over you
literally any woman
if you want to be in a relationship with a woman
ie: they’re your senior coworker, boss, teacher, team leader
other people’s opinions should have no bearing on your actions unless you are in a subordinate relationship with those people
but first and foremost im an individualist
i guess im a cynical person
it takes a lot of effort 
bevcause other people have nothing to do with who you are
which has literally nothing to do with who you are if you look at it rationally 
specifically how you treat and interact with other people
*personality
personaly
no
you’re not doing it for yourself, you’re doing it fir the other person
as long as the plan is to stay with the person
permanently 
the plan is to change
well
not fundimental changes
and its like
i mean change so the relationship can start
that’s different 
oh
what do you mean tried?
*relationship with
and you can change yourself to be attractive to whoever you want to have a relationship 
all you can do is change yourself 
because thats fucking retarded
and you can’t wait for her to change 
is that you can’t make her change 
the only thing i can say
so i don’t have any solid arguments to try and drive you two back together 
that makes sense
idk
what do you mean?
i heard this from you
and
wtf
i heard it was a timing/distance thing
what
what happened?
why not?
i guess i didn’t get the full picture 
ok
rly
even if it means becoming a hunk or whatever 
i would be doing my hardest to get back with her
if i were you
dude
to see julia?
san fran?
but if im not feeling it then that’s just it
maybe then
i can do next wednesday so
okok
but if you’re alone it like heightens your senses and makes you wanna punch shit
makes you wanna fuck basically 
the party drug
its like
is it makes you wanna move and exercise 
what it does
isn’t mentally stimulating like that
acid
waiiiitttt
oh
otherwise its gonna suck
to do it
you must be feeling it
nw
yep
yup
at 9:30
like
also i have to work monday night
and sundays im usually busy af
so all i can give you is a maybe 
idk when you get bak from SD
ok
its in the present moment and im in the mood to waste shit
cause
tonight is the only night that works 
yes
wanna do some acid together?
ive got a terrible idea
ok
alone?
are you still at your dads?
what
brotato
broski
what you up to bro?
Oh okay, cool
wassup? howdy
o i
ye
not too bad
till like 8
so thats cool
but that made it go by quickly 
work was busy af
pretty exhausting 
was uh
nm
hey guy
is possibly the best face
looking at allison
that face
remains the best
gog agog
what the fuck
i was hoping
o o o o o o o o o o o oo o o o o o o f
it was bad?
holy fuck
i mean ya smoked 2 jays with the boys
same
same
but nobody's gonna not appreciate it
i think it might be weird for people
just gonna say asking how someone's feeling is never unappreciated
but idk
agreed
(y)
ah
yeah
there are no rules
i mean if it randomly comes up in your head just go for it
nothing is gonna happen to me in the near future
in general
it gets dropped until it randomly comes up
that'll probably be how it is
am currently talking about it
i do talk about it
shove that shit down
emotions?
and im lucky enough to not be stupid enough to not repress my shit
that's called crippling depression
if you're depressed and you spend all day thinking about it
thoroughly unhelpful and probably part of the problem
but she has proven to be
a few times my mom
but i don't talk about it much
one friend allegra
eh
*ya
yq
and they all broke
a big fuckin mirror fell over and knocked like 4 mugs off a shelf
and as soon as the light went on
cause i turned a light on
there's definitely a ghost in this house
just gotta point out rq
hmm
oh ok
true
only slightly a platformer
it's also
and the levels definitely don't feel like levels
dark souls aint an indie game
ih like 1-1
thats nuts
3 hour long levels?
yeah
maybe just three polished levels or something
to get people hype
you need like a playable demo or something
to kickstarter
than 2 levels
you need more
or undertale
hyper light drifter
like uh
but if your game is good enough and looks good enough that shit will spread
you do
That's what I thought
unless you change your name and your image, you only really get one shot
and in the business world first impressions last
otherwise you're just going to look like a fool
but tbh you can't even begin the promotion process until you have something worth showing
but if you make indie games then you do need to promote them
if you're making games you don't need to self promote if you get hired by a company
and they promote you
and then you get more work from other people
you just make something good and take it to a fucking film fest where some higher power will inevitably see it if it's good enough
if you're making movies you don't need to promote
it's optional depending on the medium
well
or a internet artist
trying to become an instagram painter
unless you're like
the self promotion shit is optional
and just coast off that
hook myself up with a big name publishing company
i'll get someone to promote for me and give them some of the shares
and i don't think i ever was
im just not going to self promote
make it anyway
and will
i'd make it anyway
and like
because anything else is not doing it
and also that there isn't any other way to do what i wanted to do
is what i was trying to say
i don't feel creatively unfulfilled
fuck everyone else
3 good friends to get enough like social shit for my entire life
no i mean i don't need more than like
huh?
which is draining 
so it ends up being a game of how many ways can i tell people to kindly fuck off
i don’t want to work with anyone. and i don’t want to work for anyone, and i don’t really care to be a part of anyone’s cool thing no matter how sure they are it’s gonna blow up
and like as cool as some people can act and shit
if you make friends it's to work, generally
outside of college that doesn't happen so much
you still make friends that are literally just hanging out for the sake of hanging out
in college it's different
idk
hmm
and like
i may need 2 agents
i need an agent to do that shit for me
i want no part of it
and i can't stand that shit
it's posturing to try and get your creative pieces out into the world and paid attention to so you can make money and buy new shiny jays that people will comment on once and respect you for or something. Then you keep doing the same shit to fuck chicks so that you can brag about it for more points among your peers so you can get more attention and push more of your creative shit and make more money and maybe hopefully buy that bmw that your social circle agrees is the coolest reasonably affordable car.
social stuff is work
is seperate
social stuff
or don't do anything at all and be a normie fake asshole like everyone else
do before you die
it's just for me it's
because it becomes that important
eventually you get a project and it's do or die
specifically to waste time
things im doing to waste time
but that's like fluff
i get a bit of enjoyment from like creating dnd adventures and shit
your games that you're passionate about, you sink time, effort, thought and care into.
in whatever form it takes, art is the expression of the human soul through making shit
art is like
here's my opinion on art and creativity and shit
cause
i would use it
if there was another outlet
not that
and there's no other creative outlet i have aside from writing
its that i feel like i don't care about being fulfilled socially
it's not like i feel unfulfilled
hmm
hitting hard
wo pending
i was for a sec
i was for a sec
*talk
but i can’t do that and takk
and usually that is enough 
keep shit to myself in general
i do my best to like
i mean
im glad
yeah
i can kind of turn it off sometimes but not for long and not at all when im drunk or high
and like
in about equal measure 
both
yeah
like
relationships aren’t fun when you’re hypercritical of everything going on, same with videogames, same with hanging out with friends
cause if i find things i think are somewhat worthwhile i start overthinking shit
it’s a downward spiral though
yeah 
thats why i go on the walks and still go meet people and do things
im looking i guess 
its a
if there’s something worth living for by the time i’m done saying my piece i’ll stay, if not i don’t. On the flip side of that I also refuse to die until i finish
I think that if it happens and if it doesn’t happen isn’t exactly up to me as much as it’s up to the circumstances meeting the parameters i’ve set
i just believe that everything happens for a reason. because otherwise theres no reason for anything happening, which is probably just nihilistic enough to push me off the edge.
and i don’t particularly want you to find out or anything 
me neither 
idk
yeah
like i really only care what you think and what you have to say
like you don’t experience that from me cause we’re best friends so of everyone
can’t bother to stay in touch with most people, can’t follow social trends like discovering new bands or movies or whatever, can’t pay attention to social media because i find it really hard to care what other people think or have to say
on a socially interactive level
and once thats over with i don’t have any reason right now to keep living on earth as a person. Cause like, I sorta hate humanity, at least how it is now. And living as a person for me is very difficult 
everything i have to say to the world hidden in a series of novels.
thats what this story would end up being
for the world
in general
i don’t have much to say
im trying to explain my viewpoint here
like uh
unless something happens and like i start a family with someone 
but when it’s done i won’t really have anything else
i don’t know how long it’ll be
thats not a set date or anything 
and like
that im gonna kill myself after i finish the story
belief or mantra or something 
and lately i’ve had this like
theres spending time with friends and family, and my writing 
but like idk i don’t feel currently like i have a lot of reasons to keep going
me being depressed is actually pretty old news
this isn’t a new thing, particularly
okay
idk, if you want the deets i can give em
so like
my brain is fucked and that’ll probably never change so im not worried bout it
everything is fine
whats up bronado
oi
fuck yea
ooh
and im fuckin starving
i’ll be there in like 25 mins
so thats it
and i probably won’t leave till 8

like up until a certain point i can’t talk
i devoted my entire morning to that video
i know them all now
timestamp
like

i finished it

you've gotta see the movie
snowpiercer is definitely a sequel to willy wonka

gross
rly
kanye
knay
kaym
kaym
a milo list
its like
and rakan before that
yeahhh
yikes
dude this list is all over the place
no elise in s tier
what kind of list is this?
lmao
lmao
why?
i haven’t played hw
hyrule warriors impa
also fuckin impa in s tier???
midna&gt;medli
a is everything good
i reserve B and D for better and worse sides of no opinion tier
i also had s+ in my list so i guess
also i think there were more characters in this list
thats cause you favor c
oof
bro wtf is that bell curve
agreed
and then make those dlcs at least 5 bucks each
most people would price the base game at 30
it has a fucking ridiculous amount of content for 15
its modded to shit yeah
haha
local bug too angry to die, kills everyone.
but this isn't a best girl list this is a waifu list
tetra is the objective best zelda
if it wasn't for da booty it'd have been tetra
and i threw lana in at the end
i threw ilia in in the beginning of making the list
idk
ez
and paya is the best waifu in botw
im ranking waifus
im not
well
yeah
and the art is ass
cause she looks like she's 6
i put her in d
based on looks alone
so
i haven't played link's awakening
i told you
who the fuck is marin?
?
no i haven't
all characters depicted are of the ages 18+ for the purposes of this list
also
midna wins
same
i decided that it meant that one
since it's just the oot great fairy on the picture
yeah
trassh list
there's no distinction between the great fairies of the different games
waot
oh god
streaky may be the banger of the year
That explains it
yes
lmao
and not like song songs
but they sound like soundtrack songs
or hail paimon
maybe reborn
actually 
no
that shits fire
yeah
but it’s not
oof if spindrift was a 2018 song i might have had to put it in there 
ooh shit
ooh shit
oo
ty
i haven’t heard electra
better than these chains?
to a decent man
i also gotta give special credit
yime
at the same yime
independently
we keep suggesting stuff from the same albums
look at that
voce simul destroys half that list
but tbh
love song
i think i’d rate those all higher
also the fear
from the bambara album
wildfires, doe eyed girl
long road no turns
guest house
ocean song
oh
for 3 months
jonah has been smashing that shit nonstop
that said
i think shadow on everything is better
i don’t think it’s the banger of last year
i know these chains
and that shit will weigh on me.
cause i've seen his dick.
like for the rest of my life
i can't swap any bodily fluids with your dad, man
lmao
illaoi only kicks your ass
i didn't properly calculate this
fuck
i gotta be up at 7
it's 2 am
i like girls who can kick my ass but don't.
nah, fuck that noise
so
she can stand on the other side of the room and be beating the shit out of me by way of simple physical presence, or like eye contact.
is that illaoi doesn't have to be beating the shit out of me in order to beat the shit out of me
the problem
this was a very good one question
i think
that's all i have to say on the matter
ok
or shredding it to pieces
because she is melting off your face
or shredded to pieces
kisses from rek'sai are like having your face melted off
is the best girl
rek'sai
doing at the bottom of call the cops tier?
but what the fuck is rek'sai
i wasn't gonna bring this up
also
i think if they gave her outfit a once over she could be top of A tier imo
ashe is pretty basic
i mean
rlY?
maybe i'm neurotic for chicks with white/platinum blonde hair but
how can you be completely indifferent to ashe?
ashe???!?!
also
but i decided to take it more seriously than that
as an extra spice meme
and i was thinking of not including yuumi at all on the list
i hate neeko cause she existin
just to be clear
LOL
than the big tiddy goth gf type
made me think you're more of a fan of the manic pixie dream girl type
having neeko in b
that proves me wrong
shit
wot
tbh i was referencing vayne and diana with that line
she isn't flat
cause
i think morgana is a big tiddy goth gf
regardless of that
the thhing is
oh rly
the update?
new morgana tho?
the problem is she's more punk than goth
i'd say vi is kind of that
you're not a fan of edgy, minimal tiddy goth gfs, things that eschew human anatomy (with exceptions for mermaids), things that are ugly or present themselves uglily, things that are way stronger than they should be, have particularly unwelcoming or perhaps even, frigid personalities, or waifus that you'd have to share with a fucking bird.
then you'll settle for either someone who's hot as shit and ready to fuck your brains out at the drop of a hat, or a strong independent woman who's got the right assets and has a sense of style that suits it.
and if they're not elise,
you like your waifus to be elise
so from what i can glean from your list
i don't actually know what the lore says
that's a joke
and i think the lore says she's like 2-3 hundred years old and fucking nasty
and a garbage personality
she may have terrible taste
like fuck the dumb shit
auto A
and they're identical twins
but there's two of her
leblanc is decently good looking right?
here's the thing
LOL
elise is
leblanc isn't the bdsm character
but
leblanc is an easy a tier i gotta know what's going on there
also
no comment
but
do not agree with your placement of taliya
i personally
vane is bad
but not of my own free will
as in life or death scenario i would say yeah
*life or death
and she fits the bill
i fuckin love a woman that can kick my ass
more than just that
i mean
and i should have put quinn and kindred at the top of life or deat tier
tbh i should have put shyvana at the bottom of my A tier
yeah
you've got all the normie pics in A tier though
aaaaaahhhh
i literally can't say no
so
but eve's got it all
possibly even the only s tier option
the best s tier option
elise is literally
dude
here then
oh
and we'll go at the same time
lmk when you're done
a png fiel
wel
you just download and it gives you an img file
oh
how do i share it
ok im done
hmm
i was going by the number scale that it started with
im still working on it
ofc
cause now im gonna resign myself to being a disgusting furry just to spite you
shoulda kept your mouth shut
you dick
kindred goes in s tier just for you
fuck you
you'll never see me take something so seriously in my LIFE
go fuck yourself
oh fuck you
you've got me talking about the friend engine
you've got me talking about the friend engine
ok
im fuckin zonked bro
like
i don't know if im capable of doing that in my current state
seriously?
wait
ok
I am just curious
cause im not all that awake.
more entertained than awake
and entertained
this is just a long shpiel that im using to keep myself awake tbh
idk
and having issues
im trying to come up with a friend pun for armed forces
or General Major of the United Friendgine Army
or chief petty friendgine officer 
like friendgine manager
you could give them wonky titles
and they're the manager and you're just the owner
which for me i think would be milo
and you give them the all important job of coming up with the ideas and taking the credit
you find the person that you trust the most
once it gets to a certain point
milo might be into working at my bar though
i've got literally nothing
at all
*far
and so fare
the problem with them is getting them inspired to do anything for themselves
total goons
and i'll let you know if it works
im gonna totally try this on milo, michael, and miles
now
you collect a small finders fee so that you don't die on the street and then you make another game
i mean a share that is equal to their efforts and contributions to the project
and by all the money
and, by all, i just mean the credit for the central inspiring idea of making a game together with your friends
and suddenly it's like they don't care
but give them all the money
you take all the credit
that i almost didn't share with you on purpose?
the most important part
listen man im the 2 time friendship game champion i know how this shit works, trust
like the cold-hearted motherfucker you are
and then you SWIPE THAT BITCH AND TAKE ALL THE CREDIT
you just now know that you were the instigator and the motivation and you allow yourself to become a crucial, irreplacable part of your friend-engine, uh, friendgine. and make that game how everyone wants to make it
you don't need to be in control of it
the original idea to do this thing was yours
make the others more a part of it
slow and like
yeah well you gotta be less ham-fisted than allison
and then taking all the credit for it and becoming ceo of your own indie studio that's full of your friendployees that you work to the bone like a slave driver
by maybe making a game together
and steer it into becoming a machine designed to increase your own personal gain
is grab that friend group by the reins
now what you've gotta do
i suppose what that means is you've got good friends and a good social group
well you were at one point
and she decided, you know what, fuck uti
thats some shit that i would never ever want to deal with in a million years
like imagine nina was having a bad day
and will pay attention to shit for social gain
because you have people who potentially give a fuck for/about you
not giving a fuck is tougher in your scenario
well
yeah
nor do i think im a good role model or case to study for any humanly person or person being or otherwise.
so i think that im not a particularly good model for how a normal normie would act in any situation
i mean that because nobody really has any way of knowing what i do, i don't have any pressure or judgement being cast on any decisions i make, so the social aspect of "what would x person think if i did y action" really isn't there.
i say practically cause im not accounting for butterfly effect shit where i randomly interact with a friend of a friend of a friend who just happens to mention this thing or event that i happened to be at to someone else that knows someone who i know.
i have my information practically on lockdown
that said, i don't have any specific friend group that's privy to any happenings of my personal life unless i specifically share things with them.
only the manliest mans respects his other manses like that
i'd be like sure and i'll buy you dinner first
i'd totally go for it. because she'd probably already be cute enough for my standards
and if i found myself in that situation
on the whole i really don't care at all about traps
0 reaction from you
yeah
so
but it got
i did all this for the sake of making that joke
well
it's clear
because if it's a feminine penis
?
why not
no.
are traps gay?
to the original point
now lets round it back
you could judge me for not knowing that and it would be fair
like this instagram ho that sells bath water
unless it's common knowledge
*know
but you can't be judged on what you don't kno
now he's a bitch. get mad.
now if he knew beforehand and then gets cold feet or something
it's not a reason to be upset
no matter what or when, if it gets to a point where a dude doesn't know you're trans and decides he doesn't want to have sex with you
so in that same vein
yeah
is completely invalid as a reason to be upset
on a first meeting
like misgendering?
nobody else should be expected to know that about you
if you decide to be transgender
but like here's my point
but the further the engagement along the worse it gets
i suppose it depends
or
eh i don't know about that one
to discuss something
hey, lets take a moment
say
and leading up to that point
you could at any point before that point
well here's the thing
if you're an asshole
and then you're a trap
yes
regardless of case
but the important part is the intent
intentional miscommunication or noncommunication especially when intimacy is involved is pretty much the same as lying
the onus to share that information is on the individual
and they did do that
if a trans person goes into any potentially sexual situation without first informing their partner that they are trans then they are a trap
i meaan
people who usually discuss traps are retards who use 1 word for thirteen things
the difference is the intent to trap
or someone crossdressing
that's just someone in drag
and never anyone who appeared to be a girl but has a dick
trap was always a boy who dressed as a girl
nah
well
i think any other definition of trap doesn't fit with the original definition
that's what trap means imo
and my lancer campaign now has a good looking playlist of solid music
i think we've covered a good amount of topics for today
because it's always cool to make fun of assholes and people who are disingenuous.
and safe for discussion
i personally deem it inoffensive 
so as a meme
or if not that, because they want to be recognized for who they are
because they aren't fuckin assholes
trans people wouldn't do that
thus "trapping" them into a situation like the situation outlined above
people who crossdress very competently with the express purpose of being in relationships with others of the same genetic sex without informing them first
traps are like
yeah
is a bool
and anyone who does
i don't categorize traps and trans women into the same group
here's why i think the traps are gay isn't transphobic
now
because it looks so bad
it's actually so much better
jfc skype always butchers the lenny face and it's hilarious
l o l
switch master race idk bout you
but being a 100% manly man isn't all that fun nor is it required
it's not a very manly man thing to do at any rate imo
not a 0
idk i'd rate pegging like a 1.5 or a 2/10 on the scale
actually
it's true
don't think technically
tbh
out of 10
on a gayness scale i'd rate it about a 4
and go for it anyway
fuck it, i'll be the bigger man here
and you say
that you know the dick exists on this being that looks very very much like a woman
lets assume
now
this is the michael zone
you just know that it exists
you don't necessarily have to touch the dick or look at it
well in this case scenario
the ultimate answer is that it doesn't matter this is true
if you're a dude and you see a hot chick and you're like yeah i'll tap that and then you reach in and grab her by the dick and then ???????
now
there isn't really anything to debate about that
that's pretty homosexual
if you're a dude dressing up as a chick and hooking up with another dude
heres the thing
well
both, either
?
much
and i am not judging you
just be aware, there is no pressure
this is taking a long time to answer
are they, or are they not gay?
what's your opinion on traps
fr
now
this is some constructive debate here
okok
im gonna shoot it
is that if it looks anything like the snapchat filter
the problem
so an 8.5 on a doggirl scale's gotta be at leaast a 9.5 human-wise
cause the dog parts just naturally draw the rating down
yeah i think that works
well
ok
if they're like 8.5 up i might just be persuaded
yeaah
how hot?
hahah
and dogboys
doggirls
in light of that
so
to do that
you've gotta be fucked up
and then fetishize that
and make it like a human
and to take that
dogs are good. dogs love you unconditionally
cats just formed a parasitic relationship via toxoplasmosis
well dogs are your friends
and we kill them all
i see a catboy im lighting the fires of war
so im just gonna go with that
on an instinctual level
wrong to type
catboys sounds
ok
what about catboys
i'd be pretty picky though
not gonna lie as much as im hating on catgirls and the people who would fuck catgirls. i can't say i'd say no should the opportunity arise
yeah for sure
i suppose
then i guess it might be pretty real
until a normal girl puts on a pair of ears and a buttplug tail
at least
idk catgirls are pretty fictional
cause then if it's not, it's racist
then i suppose it's chill
if they're not human and don't identify as human
it's a problem
if the catgirls are human
that said
idk man
i think if it's got fur where there should be skin
it's pushing it
so
fur that covers her entire body
and
lola's also got bunny ears
i think that's pretty borderline.
idk
that's definitely true
and then worry later
"what would my dick do"
you gotta just say
in scenarios like this
heres the thing
that's the assumption that i came to
yeah
is it safe?
nah they're just regular
and the aliens are all catgirls
we raid area 51 to see them aliens
better bet
or
lets say we get invaded by aliens
are furries furries if they come from a different planet?
lets be real
alright
that coulda been a close one
whew.
yup
im not a pedo.
trust
i'd never put my dick in someone born after i was
fuckin kid
born october 4th 1997?
anyone younger than me = kid
actually
and 18=kid
i ain't a pedo. i don't like kids
cause
i keep forgetting that shit
but nah she's a legal adult
blatantly disregarding american law
i thought she was just
18 is age of consent
wait
dude this chick is a fucking business genius
selling bath water?
holy shit
i give her a Respect + for sure
that's fucking awesome
like not even mid-tier
this is high-tier comedy
respect
that's pretty based
fucking
wait
fucking christ
is she over 21?
wot
well i guess i'd put my dick in that
and
and jesus christ thats so much makeup
are with those faces she makes
also wtf

i don't want to look at that

i haven't watched that tpain video cause it's CLICKBAIT and FAKE
4chan

holy shit
and i gotta wait for my dad to get home
it just takes a long time
but fine
fuck you
fine.
which is like
now i gotta do it myself
no
yeah
he just refused to wire it
and we had everything we needed
it wasn't even that hard
like
yeah
and said "idk wtf to do here" so he stuck his spectrum router in the main house, said "fuck it" and took off
and then he saw what the house had
spectrum guy came to change our internet service from att to spectrum
just so i can reroute things through the normal cat5 wiring inside it
all over the house
into access points
i've gotta reprogram a bunch of routers
but rn i gotta finish that
if my internet was working
i'd be so down with this
no
that's clickbait
no
5 days
oof
5 days
august 17th?
yeah
also when was it planned?
well when is the trip?
ok
ahh
is trevor dating shannen?
hold on
shannen as in the shannen?
who played that?
oh
wait like black eyed peas?
you only have so much shit available to you
this is what im saying 
i mean
what music?
ah
oh a cabin
3 nights is 4 days
its a 4 day camping trip?
yep
like its. the shittiest
otherwise it kinda really fucking sucks
when you want to do it
camping is fun
im just gonna put this out there
hmm
yikers
oh
where does trevor live now?
wait
oh ok
which?
isnt bad
saying that
what who gave you weed
i mean saying yo i was super high but i don’t really wanna tack onto a camping trip with you, your girlfriend, and your brother’s friends. Maybe we could do something another time?
do you wanna go or not?
i’d think hanging out with them is like at least equally as valuable a use of your time, if not more
isnt your family on your dads side here?
jk
i don’t wanna go glamping with you and your brother’s fuckbuddies. im sure it will go over well
just say
fr i probably won’t be good till wednesday 
that sounds like a personal problem 
idk when in free
eat my ass
never
clunk as fuck
but ico is a completely different level of clunk
same with last guardian
shadow of the colossus controls are clunky as fuck
like
they're pretty fuckin clunky
controls
dated in like
its
oh wow
it definitely feels dated
ico is aight
yeah
im pretty sure
it'll be good
as long as 2 is just more of that
based off of the tabletop game
is a very good old game
vtm bloodlines
oh
that comes before death stranding
ok nvm
oh shit i forgot botw 2
they might
yes that shit will be good
mhmhm
and then borderlands 3
then i guess death stranding
but cyberpunk, prime 3, system shock remake, vtm bloodlines 2, 
well actually the last time i thought about it my friend pedro was 5
ah
top 5?
that shit looks good
cause cyberpunk
with cyberpunk being 1
maybe 6 on a top 10 list of games im excited for
that said this falls like
that'll be a good game
and then they just throw some crazy ass story at you
ie if they provide you with the tools to make shit interesting for yourself
like if its anything like mgsv it'll be fun
i just think hideo kojima can pull it off
like to the point where im gonna buy it day 1
im not super excited for the game 
you rly did
i think i'd like it either way
idk though
that's true
the 2018 trailer is good
and they're adorable
little trailer boxes that hover behind you
but this one has
oh im retarded im watching the 2018 1
oh the trailer im watching has walking starting at 30 secs
but it is part walking sim, so the walking is gameplay
there's a pretty big difference between how that part looks and how the cutscene parts look
i think the sections of walking look like they're in-engine
idk about that
yeah
idk i wanna hit yellow dudes with my briefcase
idk what you're watching
also
but that looks dank to me
idk if im easy to please
idk man, it starts with an interior shot of a baby's ass
the ladders are dank dude
yeah it does
but it doesn't really look like a movie outside the cutscenes
its just the e3 gameplay
no
aside from the walking bits?
wait have you seen the gameplay?
cause im a fan of norman reedus
i don't mind that
i see
while being chased by ghost hands and a pshycho dude who summons giant monsters made of ghost hands
rebuild post-apocalypse america's government by making shitty deliveries
the story's premise is kinda dumb
it definitely was never going to be like that
supernatural shit
i like the uh
just like any game by the mgs guys
there are dumb parts and good parts
i love it
what a fuckin retarded ass name
lmfap
im buying the game for that mans alone
did you look into the eyes of Die-Hardman?
are you kidding me?
“yeah i’d buy that”
like
i was looking at those crabs in the beginning 
that trailer still looks good
also
shit sux
to fix my internet problems
i had to buy a new router 
ohh
i thought you were still in a car ride from san diego was gonna try to get you hooked on worm
i thought you were still in a car ride from san diego was gonna try to get you hooked on worm
fuck
now its good
wildebeest has been rewriting the first few arcs so it doesn’t read like shitty fanfic anymore 
spend some time doing something worthwhile 
here
are you being driven there?
oh
fuck
(laugh)
(smile)
(smile)
(laugh)
(cwl)
(cwl)
That’s what I do.
also
What are you eating?
in your bones
yeah its all that guilt
eminem could get away with brotha
same for white people
a korean dude saying brotha
nono
weirder than white people
asians
hawaiians and pacific islanders can too
actually 
it can work if a its a black guy saying it
yeah
yeah brother that shits weird 
i’ve noticed that i get irrationally angry when random people call me brother or brotha
fucking A+
and also giant killer robots
its about the Aun, a sect of humanity that was set out on expeditions to far off planets with near-lightspeed ships arriving thousands of years later  and finding planets pre-inhabited by humans who got there faster with more advanced methods of travel
it can be found on massif press’s itch.io page
but it’s cool regardless 
i will warn you, whoever wrote it has a habit of making up shit and then just not explaining it
which is a short story in the lancer universe 
if you find yourself with time, i recommend you read this boundary garden thing
i was looking for shit to do a bit ago while the internet in my house had committed seppuku, and apparently the lancer lore is actually just top-tier sci-fi
so
oh
we at this bitch
charger located
phone die
fuck
or if moviepass got a sudden revival
i don’t actually have the money for it
its true
not the ritual killing but
cause the whole thing reminds me of my mom’s whole thing
that movie fucked me up
im thinking of seeing midsommar again
yeah
and make michael and miles share
i gotta room with milo
i can’t believe im considering sharing an apartment with that guy its gonna be the social equivalent of shooting myself in the foot 
eks dee
girls suck just fuck guys
maybe michael is right
thats all you can do i guess if you don’t want hookups though
i just try
so
pretty bad habits though
i do have some
i suppose yeah
or unless its this idealized version of this girl from a long time ago
like, i’m never gonna find someone. unless its iona
i just don’t think it’s a concept that’s grounded or realistic 
at least
thats my reasoning for it
exactly 
cause its like a 3rd grader concept of what a relationship should be
which is kinda fuckef
not loyalty, devotion. not admiration, worship. if i don’t feel that for them i just don’t feel like putting forth the effort 
like
volume as in affection or level of care and fucks given
:)
it’s either cranked to 200 or its off
is that in relationships i have no volume control 
nah my real problem 
jk
bet
im pickier
which means i also dont care to be picky 
because i like never having to talk to whoever it happens to be again
i like hookups
i c
lol
he just needs to shut the fuck up and let em come
noah’s good looking
que?
bands get flocks of girls no matter what they do
well yeah
yeah man i believe you
she’ll be all over ya
if you’re a half decent dancer
just say it
and while you’re dancing 
and then dance
come up with ideas and then get wasted
you can do some freaky body paint shit
you just gotta
artsy types are good
yes
start looking outside of the program then man
you’ve gotta
thats rough
those were some fucked quotes
fyi tracy now canonically uses “play dip stick” as a euphemism for sex all the times
fyi tracy now canonically uses “play dip stick” as a euphemism for sex all the times
are there any other prospective biddies to play dip stick with?
what the fuck are you gonna do my mans with the french girl unavailable
ok
where i have to read it like 3 or 4 times
and it gives me a mental pause
swsw
man every time you say that i read it like swoah swoah
oh
and also
hows dark souls?
it is
im just gonna wait
yup
but uh
did it
haha
no strings attached
first you gotta buy the ropes though
“hey i got some new games, to test out, wanna try a runback for old times sake?”
and say
you should just pull julia aside
i think
and i’ve got a reputation to build
apparently she’s never tried bondage
Thanks man!
;)
its just i can be overattached and do whatever else at the same time
still am overattached
i get the most overattachef
cause 
im gonna have to get myself some ropes though
yeah
i guess
but im just like. fuck it, if she’s happy i’ll be happy. and when she comes down here next time imma get that shit
what’s funny is honestly i couldn’t care less what she does or whatever relationships she might happen to get in up there. normally i would be like worried that she might get a boyfriend or something
i’ll just have to stay in contact 
so i’ll take solace in that i guess
its better than getting tossed out like the trash though 
yea
and she came down with said friend 
well she lives with her friend up there
im gonna drown my sorrows in liquor and weed
we sad today
yep
nope
very undefined 
at some point, yeah 
espresso depresso
im just depressed
so
rather than tomorrow 
except she left for nor cal this morning
went alright 
im good
just gonna chill
i can’t say it’s bad
so like
apparently the dark souls pvp scene wouldn’t exist without ds2
idk about least favorite of all time
i don’t know the story
apparently 2 is the worst 
bloodbourne and sekiro have the best combat, but ds 1 is the best game
i played ds 1, a bit of 3, bloodbourne and now sekiro
no
i guess that gets you good at the combat though 
gj
lol
bruh you just gotta ignore them
fuck the gargoyles 
yeah its fucking master crafted
you got past the beginning?
haha
fuck
Haha, it's true
and i can back up my prejudices because i worked at urban outfitters. so im not a hypocrite
its that i don’t respect clothing store jobs that market specifically to individuals in the 16-25 age range
its not that i don’t respect clothing store jobs
so she might have him beat
and divorced 
she got married already 
but
honestly i think might be at the exact same level 
which 
she works nowhere 
except instead of working at uniqlo 
yes
she’s like in adult limbo
she’s fine
so that’ll be cool
and then we’re all gonna hang after i get off work
and they’re all coming to my bar tomorrow 
was pretty good
yeah
high tier normie meme here
and she’s just been recovering since
and apparently iona was miserable being married to the thai chick and as soon as she got back to California she got hit by a car
uh another girl Skye is a full fledged firefighter now, just like she’s always wanted to be
which is cool, she seemed very discontent when she was with guys
Zuri came out as bi like in senior year, but now i hear that she has eschewed men for good
which is his actual name
Zuri is a girl from my class as well. she at one point dated my boy max beers
but yeah
and a lot of my classmates have spent extended periods of time at their house too, to the point where that’s just the place anyone goes for any get together 
her parents, David and Ayalet are friends with my mom now and have kept in touch much more than i have with anyone else
it was Lia’s house too
other girl is Lia
oh
yeah found out that zuri is no longer bi and is now a full lesbian.
and a good bit about me not having any social medias or anything 
and we then we just talked about random shit
afraid im too okay with
which im
so i just had to sit there and get doted on
they made me food and didn’t let me help
just talked
it was good
Tell me
Tell me
so thats actually pretty hype
tuesday they’re coming to HP though
there were 4 other girls there the whole time so all that happened was talking and catching up
its a good thing chad mars didn’t win out
fuck fuck fuck fuck
and the amount of give a shit im feeling is maxed out
haven’t done anything close to having a relationship in 6 years
i feel like im gonna throw up
fuck me man
well instakill floors will always make things fun
damn
you liking your levels?
hows it coming?
cool
swswswswswsw
whats the word from san diego 
whats up with you my guy?
sounds great ty
and hide whatever actually happened in the middle of all those
no matter what happens im gonna make up a shitton of ridiculous lies
also this is just a forewarning
Thank you my friend
if i miss the mark, whatever. I don’t fucking talk to anyone anyway 
if i miss the mark, whatever. I don’t fucking talk to anyone anyway 
and i get over there and make whatever moves i can think of
so i say “okie dokie”
i don’t care about what the tone is or whatever. The message is “get the fuck over here, i don’t care when”
but like
Well Lia said it, so it’s less outright sexy and more cute, pretending at sexy. Emphasis on certain words. like “Everyone else might not be here, but we willl.”
chad mars has been beating the threesome drum all fucking night but normal mars will settle for a very long, emotionally touching and possibly somewhat flirtatious conversation.
and it seems like they’ll be there. I called and said I’ll have to be late and thats what they said. 
yeh
but im gonna argue for 6
at 7
if its like that
pull a me and go after work
ok or just
don’t let it become worst case
fuck that, im calling in favors from my gm
if any girl that you share a mutual interest in tells you to come like iona just said to come, and you don’t? then i’ll be personally offended and won’t talk to you for a week
if any girl that you share a mutual interest in tells you to come like iona just said to come, and you don’t? then i’ll be personally offended and won’t talk to you for a week
actually 
i think the better option is to just go
idk
ik
only they emphasized that they really missed me and they said come 3 times
also i don’t clearly remember the message
im trying to get someone to cover for me
haha
none of your business 
but it made me wanna jump off a cliff cause im working tomorrow 
and it was a very uh sultry message 
like 2 hours ago i got a voice memo over text from that girl Iona and another girl Lia who I also had a mutual crush thing going on asking me to come to their party tomorrow 
so
ok
15 mins

something that on all levels should not and never have existed 
Agreed
un fucking believable 
its
move heavy shit around 
which means
at my dads
gotta help set up for 4th of july party
but we can split back to your dads i think
i am probs busy after the movie
lmao
thats it
get your ass ready for wednesday 
cool ty
thatd be cool
maybe 
and even harder with a big pet
cause finding housing is harder with a pet
asap
and my mom can’t take her
but now because i procrastinated i don’t have the time or space to really sus out a perfect owner for her
cause i didn’t want to
but couldn’t do it right away
i made up my mind about it like last year
but i really can’t support myself and her on my own anyway 
yep
i can’t keep her with me if im gonna move into a 2 bedroom with 3 other guys
cause
and also find a different home for cleo
gotta find a place 
yeah i think it is too
but no
jk
im just gonna emotionally manipulate him into doing what i want
im not going to talk to him about it
so
milo works at fucking uniqlo
for sure
yeag
just to see
chad uti would smash and dash though
yeah that would def get in the way of things in ny anyway
i see
im asking if you’ve stalked her facebook 
rather than talking
or what she’s up to
have you kept up with her?
thatd be something 
parents be nosy
yeah
is hilarious 
which
cause her dad told my mom that iona was into me
i only found out about all that last year though
yeah 4 years makes you forget dumb shit like that
im not too attached to it though
lmao
yeh me too
yep
yeah she’s fine
i dont keep up with facebook
the city
*didnt
and apparently she got hit by a car and i don’t know
she’s in santa barbra now
possibly 
eh its all good
how about that
both
what other girl?
hah?
in which case don’t be that fuckin asshole who knowingly hooks up with a married chick
unless she’s married 
take what you want, don’t be a pussy
moral of the story is
to do anything 
but was too pussy
and i was just oblivious. thing is, i really liked her
and apparently because i didn’t she was devastated
but it was really cause iona wanted me to ask her out
and i did cause i figured sure thats cool that they want me to come back for senior prom
back in senior year of highschool, iona had gotten one of the other girls in my class to ask me to go to prom with her
want to know something similarly funny/depressing?
yea mang
he could be french mafia and kill you with a hand wave
he could be a 7 ft tall monster with gorilla arms
i was gonna recommend you push depending on how much you like her, but you also don’t know who her husband is
if you’re cool with it then thats it
that’s pretty depresso
i mean bringing up the husband is a clear sign
okay 
i don’t know what she thinks
do you want to ask?
being married is stressful 
i mean
oh
her husband’s family 
not her husband 
thats a good solid reply
there you go
wait replied to what?
that she was married?
the friench girl
good thing you didn’t ask her out i guess
yeah thats nutso
but
hopefully the govt doesn’t get on her for that, iona is cool
i think it may have been some sneaky visa extension thing now maybe 
and she was living over there
it was to a girl from thailand
s o
and then divorced at 22
i mean one of the girls in my high school got married at 20
yeah
:O
:0
yeah
this shits wild
this shit gon be scary
sikh
yuh
i did c8
ok
i can’t really do a 9:45 one
or 3:15?
or 3:15?
6:30?

yuh
but will now
i couldn’t finish it last night
i have not
no
I am online now
Okay, let me know
ok
tmrw-friday
coolio
cause i don’t wanna force cleo on my dad and them
but tbh i don’t think i can stay the night 
should be good through friday
later this week?
f u c k   y e a h
not tomorrow
i do tonight
not much rn
waddup?
his favorite fucking rapper
i don’t need him to have the same tastes in stuff as me, i just want him not having the same shit taste as everyone else
idk, i want him to at least understand good shit
so
idk. and he’s still a fuckboi who listens to j cole too
cause anime is a plague
and now that lucky’s doing it, i know rocco will catch on eventually 
and thinking, “wow, this was amazing”
i guess it’s better than him eventually watching all of fairy tale
i mean
but that leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth 
mid tier shit
i guess i can give him like
maybe he’ll give it a second shot
eh
he’ll sleep through cowboy bebop until the fights
uh ghost in the shell will be boring 
like eva won’t 
so the good shit won’t land
but at 14 youre kinda dumb
the best i think i can do is to try and steer him onto the good stuff
thats my honest opinion 
and shit
i haven’t watched any and its retarded
the fighting ones basically 
like hunterxhunter which jett always brings up
14
if you talked to jett about it
maybe 
*anime
netflix and 
i don’t know what to do about it
and
lucky got into anime 
other news
oh
is good
i mean i guess yeah
oh
isaac does not take itself seriously 
isaac’s story is homestuck deep
i play gungeon for the lore
idk about you
and yet it stays on brand throughout 
cause gungeon is more retarded
not as fun as gungeon 
but also isaac is just
you played too much of it
than in isaac
cause of how enemy attack patterns and attack aiming works differently
getting good is the only option 
you can’t cheese
but gungeon is like
idk isaac felt like yeah you gotta git gud, but you could also cheese your way to wins with items and you can also have completely unwinnable runs cause of items
when you’re not used to it
but the dodge roll thing kinda fucks you
its just faster paced isaac
wow that game is fucked
and
oh btw i got enter the gungeon
im out running errands
wassup
oi
no worries 
i was not actually upset 
OI
you?
nothing really
suh
and they needed me on
there was a festival 
oh
idk
from noon to 11pm
an 11 hour shift yesterday is not
thats normal
last night woulda been fine
eh
fml
and need to be at work in an hour and a half
i just fuckin woke up
how are you
hi
im off finally 
work
someone or something defaced our poster and it’s fucking fantastic 
no fuckin way i can leave rn
the bald guy is my gm
theres an hp festival going on rn
maybe at 10 pm
not rn
then don't
if no
then get it
yeah i wanna do that
if you watch high level gameplay and think
ape out is better
but the movement is slower tbh
while he shoots up everything
it's like hotline miami if the psycho was also a karate master who does flips all over the place
cause they start losing their shit over your sick moves.
and the final boss is fuckin funny
you get to do crazy matrix shit
it is fun
yeah
like i still have trouble scoring above a c
so i guess that's where the challenge comes from
but it's hard to score well on the levels
i think you should have less health in general
it's easy to get through the game
like
bad probably
deec
eh
but easier
its flashy hotline miami
my verdict on my friend pedro 
oh sick
i didn’t think you were still there
yeah 
wot
what is up?
oi
and i think i was right
cause i imagined at the time that oxium is just a raging dickhead that looks down on everyone and everything 
but in general most of my oxium is and was geared toward harassing the people who happened to be in the oxiumized room
i like the weird stuff just as much as the metaphorical stuff
yeah
at least not much that you can get right nowwwwwowowie
or
i don’t have much metaphorical oxium shit
lol
ez
you could totally just zap some shit onto your comp and just color
character designs maybe?
idk how
take some stuff
the sword jump
oh
swordswallower?
with the double suns
its a dope planet
im sure too
tf
and im halfway done
wait i just realized i died for the first time in this sekiro play through 
fuckin i don’t remember 
takes longer
he was workin on a big spread page
buy tickets now and go on release
buy tickets now and go on release
mhm mhm
are we gonna go see midsommar at some point or what?
are we gonna go see midsommar at some point or what?
oi
good times
yup
you also get to yell SHAA
in pretty much every capacity 
hornet is just better knight 
it is
i think the jump is good
i like hollow knight
as is my friend pedro in 5 days
silksong is also hype
but they can
ofc they should make new ones
ez game
they can just reuse all the shit and assets from botw
well they’re not having to make a completely new engine and revamp the zelda style
provided botw 2 comes out then
next year is gonna be sick for games
and cyberpunk in april 
regardless
its gonna be lit
yeah
cause riju is best girl
riju
except 
agreed
and then everyone saying she was doing so much shit
i didn’t like her not doing anything 
yeah same here
ic
this iteration zelda has always been a waifu
yes
link has cheeks to clap
*now
cause zelda’s alive noe
that isn’t flashbacks
hopefully they put more storage into it
im pretty hyped
whats good my guy?
SUH
should be fine
idk
1 i don’t have money for doctor, 2 i don’t have insurance for doctor, 3 i have no money for doctors
a few major problems with that
idk
bad ass
feels like ass
what with being critically injured and all i kinda wanna sleep at night too
probably better in the day anyway 
empty, most likely 
idk
oh right the tweets
i haven't seen anything else being talked about
that doesnt look all that transphobic at all
based on a single in gama advertisement
nah i was looking at shitty news articles bashing them for being transphobic
cyberpunk 2077
got distractted by
sor
yes
ok
discorderino?
ok
rn?
i do
yes
mhm
and idk if i wanna do all that on an old ass $1000 bike
but it’d be expensive 
i could 
cause of how it fell, the handlebars punctured a hole in the gas tank.
yea
ripperino
ah
and will probably have to scrap the bike
im mostly upset i missed duck game
coulda been worse
it’s alright 
eh
for now, just gonna take a hot shower and soak the bitch
for now, just gonna take a hot shower and soak the bitch
i think it’s just a super strained muscle 
it’s just tight
not all that much 
ice it
wait another day
yeaaa
no
it’s massively swollen 
just checked now
its uh
but it was a lucky one
not good, tbh. no such thing as a good motorcycle accident 
should be fine
yeah it’s not broken 
don’t think i can play any duck game
kiiiinda fucked up my shoulder 
fell off my bike when testing it
i apologize 
no
yes
and
 what time
lol sweet
wot
i mean im gonna be honest i didn’t suggest duck game to play with julia, but if you’re busy you’re busy nw
ok, guess i’ll die then
get a game of duck game or smth going
oi i’ll be home in like an hour and a half we should 
fuckin pog
my friend pedro in 8 days tho
yeah it is
it has 8-bit absolver which i guess i can get behind 
idk about devolver bootleg
yea
:/
i gotta work now
so
and i was apparently on call for it
cause the Stanley cup is on today at 5
i was waiting to see what would happen
well
probably won’t make it there
ok
losing my shit off that
my friend pedro comes out in 8 days and i've been
and it needs to be together
my ass is apart
lemme get my ass together then
11:30-12?
what time r you done there?
?
hmm
ripperino
oh
meet you guys for lunch somewhere around the way back to sm
i can
here's what i can do
mayb
wheras to get to sm you wanna go south
but north
west of you
im like
sort of not really
?
that's the problem
i thought highland park was right next to silverlake
but i'm closer to griffith park
im closer than you are
i mean
im not all that close to highland park
you know what
ahh
wheres the thing?
? why?
nothing can happen rn that im not prepared for
a gallon of apple juice
i've got
big dick chad no headphones
like alpha
turn your volume up
just take the headphones out
oof
im not talking
cause
you sure?
can you hear me now?
can you hear me?
fuck
im dum
oh wait wait
im not going to say if it's possible for you to die in this prologue
if you don't that's also fair
if you wanna take the time to get caught up that is completely fair
up to you
okay
im gonna need my mouse for this copy pasting im gonna do
AAH
{ Acropos - 3 }
speaking of last week
i bopped that motherfucker into last week
fuck yeah i did
with xXshadowkiller999Xx
i was in a very heated and deeply personal absolver match
cause
i didn't see that
ok
i’ll be free at like 11 or so i think
waddup my dude
oi
y u h
either tonight or tmrw
so if you want we can get you in there
i didn’t post the prog
im doing fine
so
rn
work
Alright, cool
wednesday is probably the best bet
im not sure 
Ruff
no
no
this shit is a fucking journey 
yuh
sor
woah i went off
if they were taught reality, reality checks wouldn’t exist.
they work ai hard for these stupid fucking goals cause they aren’t taught about reality 
which is quite literally impossible without fucking shitloads of neigh unobtainable money 
to feel like they’re significant 
they want people to like them and their partners to love them
to have their art noticed by some famous sleezebag and get famous themselves 
and they all want the same dumbass shit
there are so many people
every time i meet someone new i want to kill my self a little bit more
idk
ehh
the world will bend to your will because nothing phases you unless you want it to
you’re in control
if you can do that
life is all about choosing your stressors 
i can make it back
in the end it’s 10 bucks and i get to pick up some sorely needed groceries 
it was a hard jump from there to emotions being a cancer that you need to excise from you
you need to kill the ego  rid yourself of unnecessary emotions 
emotions are horrible 
but yeah 
fuck me i took an uber to the wrong house 
and the only truthful thing you could possibly say is”because you don’t live here”
and she’ll scream why and what the fuck is going on and what the fuck is your problem.
eventually you’ll have boxes of some girl that you don’t actually love ‘s shit at your house and all you can do to get rid of them is pull the gigantic asshole move of leaving them outside 
i mean, it starts with a toothbrush, then a hairbrush, then a shirt or two
wben you bring a girl home, eventually she’ll start leaving shot
it’s a good fucking rule
im not mad about it or anything, cause honestly 
yeah
which means instantly60-75 percent of girls are out of the picture 
so unless they feel super comfortable having me at their place, then nothing is gonna haporn

rn my rule is that i can’t bring anyone home ever
and everyone else can go fuck themselves or wait in a 2 year line to be thoroughly vetted
where literally the only people i’d consider sleeping with are ones i’ve known for years
im at a point
its all gay
which is 70x worse
tinder is waiting for messages 
sending messages is bumble
this is bad
i nearly fell asleep on this rooftop 
it’s literally just a minor convenience for them
and they don’t care
cause they do the selection thi g
tinder girls are the worst 
nah
and the emotional battle is where it really hurts 
lmao
i know you would
ok
second date is fine
*fuck a tinder girl on the first date
if you fuck a girl from tinder i will fly to new york and fuck you up
tinder is the worst ever
i don’t actually know how the relationship ended so me making grandiose assumptions is completely unfair to the two of you.
ok THATS a good point
well yeah
but women don’t want to kick my ass
love a woman that can kick my ass
i love
and i hate it
because it’s fucking awful
you don’t have to agree
if you say that shit to a tinder date i would bet everything i own that you could marry that tinder date the very next day
in fact
tjat julia wanted someone to take complete care of her and be 100% responsible for anything that she might run into
i can basically guarantee.
thats why that relationship ended
even when i was sucking the dicks or i was at the pussy’s beck and call
and i’ve never once been in a relationship where i haven’t felt responsible 
when you’re the make you are responsible for everything that is and everything that comes
is responsibility 
being the male or being the female in a relationship
the difference in taking and being taken
regardless
so that’s that
che shouldn’t exist and to me he doesn’t exist 
who had no business being parents 
che was a product of especially retarded parents 
cause che doesn’t exist 
so 2
but fuck che and fuck every memory of every atom of that faggot cuntwad cuck
actually 3
two
yeah
i understand why girls enjoy it
that’s intoxicating
theres a particular smell that dicks have. 
esp if that dick is bigger than yours
is that sucking a dick is pretty damn sexy
because i do trust you
the truth 
i told you day 720 im a manipulative bastard 
and you stop caring
so that the truth and the lies are indistinguishable 
which is mix in the truth with like 4 different lies
the same thing i do to everyone 
tbh
the no was a lie
no. &gt;_&gt;
.
thats a fact
*trou
im gonn swing if your dad drops troy
tbe fact that thats not a euphemism is seriously depressing 
which
i’ve sucked too many dicks in my lifetime 
for posterity’s sale
i need to establish myself as not gay
but
i know
i’ll knock your dad out or die trying 
im serious 
if he shows me his dick we will get into a fist fight 
.
and it makes me sick 
it’s engraved into my memory 
honestly do not ever want to see your dads penis again
i
if milo grows a pair and moves into my house in september he will grow
he will
so i suppose that makes us brothers
we saw your dads dick together 
tbh i only know trevor from the camping trip 
i love mo
wo skype
m i l o
im just messing 
suck my dick
so uhh
im genetically better than everyone else
of natural speaks charisma
that’s because 
i’d also have to become a grade a asshole, but that’d be worth 
i’ll have to work my ass off but it’d be worth it
i’ll try
then i’ll be making the money to visit you
hopefully i’m managing by next year
w/e i’ll try and do once a year
it is quite tough 
im not crying anymore 
ok
you’re literally the only friend who i trust 200%
you gotta understand 
ok
ok
make enough money to come and visit you regularly 
i don’t 
wait but
 ox not 
oh fuck
wait im fuckung crying mow
why?
?
you’re staying in ny
what
and if you know half of what shit is you’d know he’s a bitch
what justin is, is a poser bitch who doesn’t know shit about shit
it doesn’t matter 
um as far as what justin did?
you gotta prepare yourself for when your mom kicks you out, cause otherwise you’ll have to live with your aunt that literally makes you want to slit your throat with every word that comes out of her braindead mouth for two fucking years. and that’s IF you have a decent support system in place 
but you’re first place will literally be the fire after the frying pan
i was lucky enough to work at a couple places before my dad’s so i could learn how to get into work mode beforehand
no matter what, the first job you get, you’ll be at the bottom of the food chain
because managing isn’t being a boss but some people think it is
and he’s gonna fire everyone that dude hired in the next two weeks
assistant general manager 
*agm
my dad just fired his a
and if that person fucks up then you go with them
as soon as you get a job in the industry someone is going to be trying to use you to fuel their ego
the year after next maybe, but college is a fucking trap
don’t plan on that
next year won’t be it
im sitting on top of a random ass rooftop rn talking to you cause i feel 60% in control rn
there are many words. boss, baller, pimp, master, person in control of their own life
baller is just the word im using to describe it.
the difference is your wants are less because you dont give half a shit
high tier you can get everything you want
low tier you can get pretty much whatever you want
because its a different state of mind
high tier baller is technically easier to reach than low-tier
Inconceivable!
Indubitably.
thats why it’ll come easily to you
because you don’t want it
you’ll reach high-tier baller
you will tho
most guys will never reach that status in their lives
just understand that jett is a low-tier baller.
he follows rule#2
he doesn’t talk
jett is smart
and with big tiddy goth gfs too
jett is getting so much pussy its ducking hilarious 
exactly 
maybe you’ll ask why i suspect that of milo? because it’s literally human nature 
*it
cause tbe hot chicks there are either in relationships or 10 times out of his league and know ir
which is next to impossible at smc
but i suspect what he wants rn is to party and fuck a bunch of hot chicks
/barback/whatever he wants
plus he’s got a ridiculous amount of love in his heart. which makes him a god-tier bartender 
he’s got an insane amount of focus on the things he wants to focus on which leads to him being super knowledgeable.
he’s actually got a great personality once he gets out of his shell
honestly i could see him working at my hyperion public which is why i wanna keep him around 
i think he’s literally at uniqlo cause he could get in easier with diego working there
uh
yeah
milo already has a job and tbe rest will
idk i heard if from milo
like if i had to choose between saving the lives of the entire world or yours i’f choose you in half a heartbeat my mans
like supreme god tier priority over everyone else in the fucking world.
you have
i mean ofc i give you all the tips first 
i dont want michael being michael and i don’t want miles being poor
i don’t want milo working at uniqlo
september and cause im sick of them being dumbasses
by handing down teachings from my dad
and teach those retards how to be bosses
im gonna be the supreme patriarch
it’ll be great 
y e p
those are the rules im setting for milo michael and miles when they come live in my house.
if you happen to leave your mark in someone you didn’t want to, you better either handle it or be far, far away before the morning.
like rule #1 leave your mark, rule #2 keep your damn mouth shut kind of serious
this is serious shit tho
yeah 
and some crazy ass bitches like my manager there might actually think of them
if you bring that up it will be a selling point 
your dads got money 
you too
which is something that must always be taken into consideration 
still old enough to get pregnant if i were to go in bareback and not ask questions 
shes like late 30s early 40s
cause i don’t wanna dig myself into a hole i cant dig myself out of
but i won’t 
i would absolutely fuck her
at a certain point age is not important 
she’s a hot cougar
2 weeks from monday
stfu skype you shit
2 weeks
l u l
you don’t look at the wives of your friends 
but
for the past month in a half she’d been flirting with me and telling me about how shitty her relationship is and how much she wanted out
granted
i fuckin grabbed my manager around the waist right in front of her boyfriend 
last time i got to this point
like also being drunk enough that you can use it as an excuse 
but
i like being in control 
and this aint it
there def is a sweet spot
you’re probably better off just matching everyone else 
if you’re tryna be a part of the party then idk
its fine if you really wanna be smashed
i mean
clears and browns
i been mixing my tequila with my scotch so its harder than normal
yea
ok drank is hitting me
love
of loce
plowing into the fields
mount whittenberg orchestra
the powers that be
into pink lemonade 
you wont get what you want
too much work
i don’t make charts cause that has an implication of permanence that is completely untrue 
disappeared behind the sun is fantastic 
i still need 6 more
hmm
the money store
the money store
after those three would be
but i guess
i don’t count speakerboxx cause i never listen to it
which is soubdtracks, vespertine, the love below
i only make a top 3
or i guess i can try
it changes weekly
which is funny, top 10 albums?
for me, it’s only second to soundtracks
its a ridiculously good album
an echo a stain is fucking fantastic
but i like cocoon more than pagan poetry tbh
vespertine is the only perfect album imo
a l r i g h t .
no comment 
comment
no
whatever you like
uh
you can like
w/e
you’re wrong, but

you have a choice of extensive body modifications available to zeiat

salty savory probably 
dinnertime boyos

hmm
in the middle of a conversation
i was absolutely planning on putting you on the spot with all this at once
ok pick 2 salty, savory, sweet, spicy.
potatoes, big roastees, chopped and baked/fried gold/purp tates, or mash
now
yeah agreed
we’re assuming that zeiat knows his shit
of both
best
and any kind of potates
any kind
yea it is
rice or potates
and finally
salads or roasted veggies?
ok
anything that isnt soup

1st prog is halfway done
1st prog is halfway done
the butt bump in the end makes the whole video
this one isn’t 20 mins
here’s another goldie for you
that its still just as funny as the first time through 
and its so fucking ludicrously stupid 
i’ve watched it like 13 times 
lemme tell you man
and it only gets better when you pause to read the chat
the revolt of cargonia
gay furry roleplayer eradication
lsd donut cannons
turning patients into pizza
it has it all
*gold
its fucking golf
10/10
hopefully you’ll like them

two (2) prologues are currently in the oven
there are more prologues on the way

gute morgen 
ok
ah
be blessed with a link
here
i know
not really 
but
which is fine
that you never watched that space station 13 video 
i have a feeling 
WHATS UP
OI
Yeah, they are
ofc
unless like they're good
and don't let any big shittier companies hire you
never compromise
indie games do tend to have better mechanics in general you are right
huh
ya indie nerd
yeah
i may just regress
if they start not being shit, i might
yeah
but
i dont play a fuckton of videogames anymore
since
Im not sure if i really care all that much
anyway yeah
like bungie bought themselves out of their deal with activision, so maybe they can make something actually worthwhile 
and all the news these days is about companies getting fucked for all their shitty decisions 
then death stranding in november 
we’ve got borderlands 3 in september 
which makes me happy 
were gonna start getting good big budget games again
pretty soon
i think
And why?
sweet 
sweet
prob
mon and tues im busy 
well then we’ve gotta hang wednesday 
oooof
when are ya back in la?
uh
cool
what have you been up to at your dad’s?
yuh
yup
i just moved like 50% of my stuff into storage 
oh im still here
i can see that being a factor 
impressive 
its fucking hilarious 
yup
perfect 
its
and the songs are all pretty short
its just there are too many songs
or not too long
honestly i think its too long
this new one is
yuh
mhmm lmao
ofc
i don’t know which is better
idk i like youre dead
yeah
it's very similar to you're dead
idk
it's not bad
just cause its so completely different from anything he makes
really like say something on flylo’s new album
man i fuckin
i think it’s a prime example of my degrading mental state that the first thing i thought of when i saw this was “you look like you’ve got a bad case of updog.” in an attempt to reverse engineer that fucking stupid joke.
Oh, I hope so
ofc
Ok i get that people were asking for the grombo to be thinner, but come on, NO ONE wanted the grodus to be removed. Who the hell asked for a wireless floob? How in the world does the floob being wireless help anyone? This is just another prime example of designers getting wet over their designs and forgetting function. I'm sticking with the Plumbus 8 and waiting for them to bring the grodus back.
losing my mind
im fucking
demanded that we remove the grodus
the idea of making the plumbus truly portable
the plumbus X is the best video ever made
i take it back
actually
next to ghouls and bools
is my favorite youtube channel
this guy
i think
about a 6/10
was late cause i was tired af
i was at work for most of it
eh
yup
and then he’f just keep saying it
and he’d be like “Hey, you know, I walked into Uti Jacking off last night, haha”
like wait until it was just you him and maybe luna
hed be sly about it first
cause you know he’d tell everyone 
*did
and if it was juan thats literally the same as if the entire family dif
same
thats a fucking awkward conversation though 
so i suppose you’re lucky
that sounds pretty spot on
yeah
but i don’t think theres such a thing as an ideal getting walked in on scenario 
i mean i suppose 
felu is a little stoner now?
hfs
so funny
so terrible 
notfunny im definitely not gonna laugh
really
thats
hfs
.
this dude is unstoppable 
this dude
its better without sound 
lmao
i don't think he got my passive agressive metaphors tho
and that was rly it
no gloves
so i had to end it
you told me we were beefin
and then i said
and said i put him on blast
he asked if i was beefin
nothin
oh
hi
sansa fucking juuling
maybe
idk
i mean i have a second place lined up it’s just a month or two till the space is actually available 
nina’s fine too
yuh
they will, even if i end up homeless for a few weeks, cause i have DETERMINATION 
and they probably will, because the universe is structured off of the power of your subconscious, and my subconscious is a fuckin beast.
i think things will work out
my one saving grace is that im actually a likable piece of shit rather than a regular piece of shit
thats why my dad married her
she’s cutthroat 
but also yes
no
idk if i’ll even tell her before the last day
and i just gotta deal
i think whatever happens will happen
idk
i might as well kill myself
i didn’t call for mother’s day.
who
whether or not i go homeless for the foreseeable future revolves around a yes or no question asked to my stepmom
so basically 
which i’ve waited 5 months to do
but i need to ask claire
which i did
is that i can ask my dad
my cushion currently 
yeah
except i haven’t found a place to move to
so my aunt and i are moving out
the lease is up on the apt june 1st
oh no
i have 10 days to secure a place to live
cause im totally fucked
but i need to really not do this
i’m probably gonna be here all night
i drink
now
i work
and ah oksy
and my ears
they hurt my eyes
perfect description 
or not
i can’t tell if he genuinely likes them
cause it def seems more like he’s making fun of the songs than anything
so i just get depressed 
but idk. His voice hurts my ears, and his dancing hurts my eyes
now if people were to make memes of him maybe i’d enjoy those
since he isn’t meming
i can’t enjoy him as a meme
idk
with him
it makes me depressed 
id like it more if it was a meme
...
yeah i did
this is ricardo fucking milos
i just realized that i sent you a shitty version of that one
ricardo is a god among ants
ricardo?
im
wassup
oi
but ancient alien macguffin artifacts are not
mostly cause magical bullshit is dumb
sci-fi is always better
and now im making a lancer campaign 
whelp i’ve officially put my big ass dnd campaign in the “maybe later section of my mental faculties”
comes with a full compendium of everything in the free pre-release version of the game
and its so fucking clean man
i just found this in depth character sheet app for lancer
ooh boy
nice
yuh
we’ll get to them when we get to them
so
drafting up a few new ones
i’ve been
nice
whoops
(tongueout)
that was it
and went through the red playlist and identified some things i need to change/fix
i fuckin beelined it home
nothing 
sor
&gt;.&gt;
so hol up my mom’s calling me...
i was saying
o h
i made the mistake of walking home last might too
alright now i gotta take a shower and get my shit together 
hol up my mom’s calling me
so
that’s awesome dude
oh shit
not today
skype aint givin it to me
*cuckboi
cuckbou is brutal
w o lag
yeah
idk if anyone who hates blind people can be best man at my wedding.
if it isn’t number 1 by september we’re gonna have problems 
thats hype
idk im not mad
yeah
wait he did cop and filth before glowing man?
is he saving it for last?
oh
where the shit is soundtracks for the blind? you   l i t t l e   f u c k
but
ya
nah its good. esp when weighted against the rest of the world.
tbh he’s got a good list
so i’ll give him those
tbh there are a lot in there i don’t know
ah
pretty much all dudes
i didn’t know godspeed had
lmao
overhete
[1558040410] hippothotamus: and also, its literally sad white boi core

&lt;&lt;&lt;  hfs
choking
Im
and that got him into music
i know he was into jojo music
but i could see noah being into to be kind
i don’t know his full musical repertoire so i don’t know what he likes
could not like oxygen 23 times
who
noah’s gonna be the best man at my wedding one day
the last true debonair
music expert and lady killer
noah perloff
^
really into that one girl who was a bitch
i remember when he was getting 
freaking out that noah has a gf
im still fuckin
yuh
im always down to hear what’s going on with ya
course
of 
im
regardless that’s pretty cool
well
Good to hear
and everything should work out
just pull her aside after class and say some B-list porno lines
so i guess you just gotta wait it out
yeah fuck that
aside from sending her a letter or something 
about as formal and forward as you could possibly be
its
*yeah
probably yeag
hmm
l m a o
hahaha
on google docs dms
hitting her up
so its like
wtf is slack?
so you have no ways to get in contact with her without either being in class or through the convoluted and messy process of asking other people for help?
oh ok
snapchat?
is she going back to france for the summer or for good?
100%
probably both.
yeahhh
probably somewhere in between
i can’t decide if that’s good role model material or if it’s hot and you should bang her.
im conflicted
before she said you should make it grass?
oh nvm
or was this the project you finished?
do you have to turn this in at a later date?
if you just make the grass look like grass you’re fine
never heard of no grey white journey
you’re fuckin fine then
gold and red?
well what colors are the ruins
not much wrong there imo
so there’s 
journey do be the shit tho
jfc
fuck sand
or whatever 
or in a campaign 
in some sorta spoof meme shit
cause now i can use it
 glad i wasnt right
batons
l m a o
idk
thats not the name
beauxbottoms from harry potter sorta thing?
whats that voice?
the uh
new skype is the worst
i think you made the big brain move
and unless she comes back with a massive chad boyfriend its not like she won’t still be into you when you get back
but yeah that’s fuckin fair
i thought you meant that and just ran with it
yeah
or wait 19
oh right shit
imo 22-25 is better than 18-22
go for it
unless you’re really into any projects you’re working on Oh shitt?
like outside of work and projects
whats up with you?
but
yeh
still the most wrong you could possibly be
a bit is still the worst
yeah
and apparently that’s mellowed him out a bit
he got a girlfriend from one of his college courses, though
nope
but its not like im gonna be doin it again cause i dropped that game
nah i did, but i thought it’d be less shitty
i could probably do something like that for my own game if i was that fuckin hungry for it, but not for someone else’s
and worst of all i mind doing that bullshit for eric
cause it means you gotta like get to know them in order to see if they’re a fit for some shit that could hopefully span several months/years
i mean i don’t mind the posting it part, i mind the sifting through people and picking the ones you want part
especially cause of dnd streams like critical role. All the even minorly campy nerdy types eat that shit up
you sorta gotta advertise your shit, but yeah. You put a post on the forum, any forum, rly, and then just say what your game is and what you’re looking for and so long as you don’t look like a weirdo scumbag you’ll get millions of nameless internet zombies flocking to you
i mean
looking for group and looking for player
oh yeah
and i don’t like doing the LFG/LFP thing.
cause reddit peeps are a grab bag
probably not
that and walking home and shit
but that’s really it
which can be depressing
and then i try and find people in absolver 
nah i fiend over k6bd and try to write a dnd campaign
jk
cry
but im doin fine
no breaks
wassup?
ah
and for some reason tag is day
nacht is night
morgen is morning in german
well

its same thing
guten nacht
i hope he never changes 
that mans is fantastic 
i love it
the most noah thing i’ve ever heard
thats
the first time?
for
huh
w h a t   t h e   f u c k
also w h a t
what it means
he’ll know
if you wanna come to my place then hell yea
so
i work 7 days a week
tell noah i said, “happy hunting, brother.”
ok sleep
that bastard
without me?
why where he goin?
Drink more
FUCK SLEEP
NAY
AH
wtf you doing awake btw? its 4 in the morning, fucker
Skype don’t know
What guy?
Quote of my fucking month
“is it a social faux pas to snip the end of this bad boy and finish it?”
i just make him fall off a ledge instead of fighting him
and it's not that cool
demon of hatred is the most bullshit piece of shit asshole bastard ever made
but i kill him every run
i’ve never fought the demon of hatred in any of my playthroughs of sekiro
this is sick
like yesterday i left at 11 and got home at 4
so it could take anywhere from 3-5 hours 
but i make stops
from my job to my house its a 2 hour walk if i don’t make any stops
yeah lmao
ya gotta give it time
or a 30 min walk?
like a 2 hour walk?
for how long though?
start walking home alone at 3 am and yours will be too
i mean
we walked to the bar that was down the street, called his sister and an ambulance and i passed him off to them
after i woke him up
dude was bleeding from his head and couldn’t remember what year it was.
cause last night i found a dude who was wasted who had passed out in the street after falling off his uber bike thing.
so my usual tuesday night ritual thing must be cursed
yeh
to survive 
it would be an incredibly hard game
ahh
i guess i could date... my dog?
i mean
that’s fucking hilarious 
while one of the players is on a date?
so it has to be played 
wait wait
oh ok
how does the keep talking one work?
that could be time consumin
holy shit what are you working on?
y i k e s
wassup?
i figured, nw
sup
lmao
~49 hours from seasons 5-8
hmm
so
but all these episodes are closer to 2 hours
7 episodes now 6
oh right
wait season 7 was only 8 episodes right
or
official waste of 40 hours of my life
game of thrones
ech
felt like they really didn't care about killing each other
when you have 40 seconds of arya pissing herself for no reason in between the hound falling down some stairs and the mountain walking down those stairs
and it felt like
cause they didn't pick up exactly where they left off too
it ruins the tension
and "wow they're such good directors look at those flashy scene cuts"
and "cool directing"
cause it's "stylish"
i hated the cuts to arya during that fight more than anything tbh
dumb af
the zombie makeup was okay
i did like the face
ok, don't care anymore
just like oberyn i was like
when the mountain went for the eyes
shit was lame
it would have been better if it just didn't happen
he woulda needed stilts though
cut that budget a bit i guess
yeah
idk
but
lul
now we're fucking cooking
with ed sheeran
just replace sansa
lmao
that woulda been a better ending
and the show had to be cancelled indefinitely
was if the writers died of heart attacks just before they got to season 8
i think the only way they could have fixed that shit
yeah lol
and being a bitch for no reason
still telling on her family
she still be doin the same shit
regardless of what shes saying
she talks the same
alls im saying is
it's "but what if there was a better option"
oh wait that wasn't the line
but like, when all she says to tyrion are some shitty one liners then, "i have something to tell you"
i guess if that was the case then sure
which yeah
because i have -10/10 faith in the writers
i assumed that she didn't
nada
nah
the stabs don't even impact him at all
yeah
but
its just that sansa has a bitchface when she whines now
there's no difference between s1 and s8 sansa
js
when i went back and watched s1
also
to pad screentime
it's literally there
what the fucking dick was that
literally serves no purpose whatsoever
that whole fight with euron and jaime
what the fuck is that supposed to be?
like
and focused on her crying and shit
they tried to give her all these moments
cersei too
same with pretty much everyone except jon
idk wtf is going on but that's not the character they had spent seven seasons building to
and then arya tries to help all those women and they immediately just get run down
because they decided to try some cool shit with cutting between the two of them
looked so fucking stupid imo
with arya and the hound
the whole sequence
like
i think that those started in like season 5 or 6
there were no lighting tricks to make things look overly pretty just for the sake of it looking cool, and there weren't any like, long drawn out closeups that happen for no reason.
at least season 1
well
in general
cause season 1-4 the cinematography was pretty shitty
now i have to see
actually
that's what it's been this whole season
look at all this pretty camera work, wow these directors are so good.
that they did so they could get some feels out of the viewers cause everyone's dying and wow look at these pretty shots
the whole episode felt like shitty bullshit
i prefer the word bullshit
unearned is too soft of a way to put it imo
like i could see her maybe going and accepting the surrender and having cersei burned alive
its that there's no fucking reason for her to go that far off the deep end at all, based on what they've given us.
it's not that it's unearned
apparently that was foreshadowing
with the eyes
*prophecy
the fucking melisandre prophesey
like they threw all logical and reasonable continuity out of the window and said "oh i bet people wouldn't expect for daenerys to go crazy and burn down kings landing lmao" "oh yeah that would be awesome, wouldn't it?" "totally awesome dude, we're so good at subverting expectations."
but it seems like they just villain-ex-machina'd daenerys there
i suppose useless is alright
considering what happened this past episode?
which
he's just a side-piece to daenerys
he doesn't have his own arc after that though
he's not useless
i mean
yeh
yeah that was good
and all the shae business
tywin's death was fantastic
oh right
i guess i'll watch that
yeah
where ygritte dies?
right?
the wildlings fighting on the wall?
4 is
eh
and im just gonna stop at the red wedding
im gonna watch season 2
and it's still the best shit ever
i went back and watched the first season
idk man
yeah
for shitting on my intellectual property
i'd have fuckin sued them by now
if i was grrm
"we're epic"
and they were like "nah"
apparently
hbo offered them 10 episodes
they actually killed it an episode before the finale
complete fucking garbage
noice
owie zowie
i shlept through that response 
i been sick so
live
well
uh
very
i mean they do well done
orly
d o p e
did they play anything new?
how was that?
wowee
fuckin wild man
a little less than 10 times what they had planned for
the fucking horus lich mech
we’re gonna get it
holy shit man only 6k left with 15 hours to go
all i can say is
*preview
i saw a previee
oohhh
wait, no saturday’s
tomorrow’s page
oh my god
18k left
pretty much a fuckton more everything 
stress intensifies
the Lancer kickstarter has 37 hours left, and it’s 25k away from meeting the last 400k stretch goal.
in other news
so yeah that’s why i was meming you with idks
so yeah that’s why i was meming you with idks
i honestly can’t make one like this cause i haven’t listened through swans discography multiple times
i like this list
cool
i already said
idk, man
isshin ashina is a good character, suck my dick
hesitation is defeat, sekiro
i do know one thing, though
i just dont know
i d k maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
idk mannnnnnnnnnn
idk mannnnn
.
are you becoming a kind boy?
oh man
olly is satan incarnate
cause fuck olly
im still adamant that the last good got episode was the one where olly gets hanged
yeah
that was a move on par with just randomly sending the flaming sword dothraki into the dark first, alone, with no backup
wtf
like
i was so surprised that they didn’t just send a raven
tyrion should have been turned into a pincushion 
that was rarted
yeahhhh
then has the archers shoot her corpse or something 
doesn’t give messandei a stupid one-liner moment and instead unceremoniously pushes her off that ledge
stands there for a bit
cersei walks up
like
but they could have done it better
i like that they just executed messandei
same
not that anyone wants to fucking touch the series now 
he shoulda just handed the series off to pat rothfuss or brandon sanderson
grrm fucked up making it canon
they’ve said those same 2 points for 4 episodes now
gives me a fuckin migrane
and then throw in a bitchy one liner to end the scene
and then sansa, “b-but, fuck u, you bent the knee, i dont like it”
and jons like “but this woman she’s actually pretty dope and i love and respect her, besides i never wanted to be king.”
sansas like, “muh jon you bent the knee, fuck you”
yeah me too
daenerys has always been emotional and boolish
like ever
i mean they’re doing the same with daenerys but they don’t make her out to be smart
it just makes her seem like a petty bitch
like it doesn’t build tension 
why is she so fuckin stupid all the time
fuck sansa man
okay
you saw episode 4?
i gotta rant about got for a sec
ok
its like uno but you wanna kill  the other players by putting down 6 cards on one turn and making them pick up 8
crazy eights is the shit
*8s
you’re better off playing crazy 8a
but if you wanna play uno
at least you get to choose what card to play
uno has better gameplay than bingo
what?
no strategy 
theres no gameplay 
nah
bingo do be shit tho

LOM
LOJ

*imo

ezpz
you could get free drinks and shit
people just come regardless and bingo is going on so they play
nobody 
in the hot-wheels days
when i was like somewhere between 5 and 7
actual monster trucks doing anything was
i think the last time i saw like
while bingo night is going on
in other news we’re watching monster trucks at my job
: 0
0:
spend an hour watching a single youtube video twice 
sabatoge that shit it don’t matter as much as this video does
but
im just messing 
dont be a poosi
yes you can
holy fuck theres so much detail in the video
because 
then watch it again and pay attention to all the screencaps of the chat
watch it all the way through once
its fucking good
i will link it
yes
that i still don’t know if you’ve watched yet
well a reference to sseth’s space station 13 video that i sent you
theres a space station 13 reference in the comments 
i only consult only the content of the holy offerings
im not looking at it
ic
oh
unless im just dumb
i don’t think we’ve seen any backstory from jadis afaik
jadis’?
her uh
jadis is gonna be scary though
maybe
mottom a bitch
for me
next to incubus
best demiurge 
fuck yeah
jesters
psycho.
is honestly better
which
well it’s either a joke or its one of gog-agog’s psycho jesters making an enterance
kms
:000000
this is extremely important 
i need to see how white chain reacts to playing poker
tattoo 
s driving me insane 
i haven’t even checked the new k6bd page yet
haven’t had a chance to check tt man in full
send me the acct
that sounds like a recipe for greatness 
noah on rym?
oh no
why is that what it is?
that album art is a fucking real rancid vag
lmao
100% right hfs
oh so i was right with my beatdown shitpost
?
what does martin listen to
eh
thats a 1/5 effort right there
i thought thered be more fake language rapping
wait i just skimmed the rest of the album and it’s like a 6/10
which hampers my enjoyment of reading the lore
the actual storytelling has kinda shitty language 
oh i mean like “steel mogu is a xao and being a xao sucks so he decided to travel back in time and kill clear tamei”
oh i mean like “steel mogu is a xao and being a xao sucks so he decided to travel back in time and kill clear tamei”
the language is just really dumbed down
specifically like
i don’t like some things about it
it’s alright 
and
okay i had the time to read the lore
they just have a spectacular logo
not that bad star is a cool gang name
the xao void goons is the coolest fucking gang name next to BAD STAR
just saying 
yuh
and let people on the internet translate it
not actual translations but just like a language dictionary 
like
or a code to translate it
release translations 
or
yeah
he could make an incredible album if he did that
i think he needs to not rap
yeah
pretty metal tbh
thats one way to do it
yeah it does
ahh
im with it
clear tamei vs steel mogu
it’s pretty dope
lmao
about two gods
for his albums
and apparently this iglooghost guy has lore
so i did some research
and start with a shot of tequila 
i wait till im there
lmao yeah i don’t do that
smoke sativa and drink clear tequila
im not ballsy enough yet to go do that shit
the problem is being self conscious when it doesn’t happen
i mean
and it instantly filters out whoever.
if they want to
and they make the move
put the onus on the other
and don’t if they won’t 
and conversations start if they will
then i dress and look appealing and then just make eye contact
i just force myself into situations 
thats a bad way to put it
huh
i feel like a predator that doesn’t really want to eat
so like
despite most influences in my life currently telling me to go for it
but i don’t really want that
i could totally get my dick sucked in the bathroom or something
if i pushed for it
which is like
well results are generally positive 
and
like i’ve been testing out how to talk to random ass strangers
and i feel like a bit of a predator 
but lately i’ve been thinking a lot about how i think, specifically in social situations
with the need tp fight someone
im pretty sure i said it earlier
so
Well, that's good then
sorry got busy 
dads good
*aside from trivial shit like “im walking the dogs now” or “im heading to work”
aside from like
on her days off we just don’t talk
and shes at work by then
so i normally sleep till like 12-1
am
with my new hours i don’t get home until like 5
pretty easily 
and absolver is pretty much dead
beat sekiro which was rough
uhh
i also haven’t talked to my mom in 2 weeks which is great
i have essentially stopped talking to my aunt entirely and i’m totally fine with that
and i don’t get upset over people either
but in general i don’t get that upset over things
i just need to find something/someone that makes me mad enough to fight them
in general i am an emotional time bomb 
in other news i literally just learned how to do a bridge while shuffling cards
till you know
You never know
and i guess im glad i didn’t 
or something 
or stabbed him in the balls
to a point where i feel like had i had my own knife on my like i sometimes do i probably could have killed him
i was weirdly calm throughout the whole thing
okay i guess i can handle myself in that scenario 
it just feels like
tbh i haven’t talked about it to anyone cause it wasn’t that bad
im fine
and nope
forgot 
yup
then jump down the stairs and take off
i don’t say anything, kinda nod, step up there and stomp on his crotch
then he looks back at me still jerking his dick and says “hey, wanna suck this dick?”
i pass him the shit back and he puts the stuff away 
while i do that the dude starts unzipping his pants and jacking off
and i take it and pretend to do the same
he goes, takes a big hit, then passes it to me
and an unpacked cigarette to smoke the shit through
he plops down, puts down the knife, and pulls a lighter and a little tin foil card thing that had the meth in it
i go a couple steps below
he climbs to the top where he’s got a backpack stashed 
he brings it in for a handshake and i follow him across the street to this stairwell hidden by a bunch of bushes
and say, fuck it, sure.
look at his wacked out eyes
i look at his knife
at that point
tuesday
he says “hey, i got some crystal, wanna kick it?”
i say “nothin much man im on my way to the black cat to meet my friends” complete lie nobody was there
says “hey, bro, wassup?”
but he makes a beeline straight to me
he doesn’t open it
he sees me and pulls a switchblade out of his pocket.
and i see this guy with one hand in his hoodie pacing around on the other side of the street on my way to the black cat
*do
and i was just walkin, blasting some daughters as i usually so
well my usual route is from my bar hyperion public, to the black cat, to 4800, to a few others
all in all was pretty cool
but yea
than that
was a bit more involved 
and then booked it
had to stomp on his balls while he was jacking himself off
then tried to get me to suck his dick
ran into a dude with a knife who tried to give me meth
after work at like 11 or so
the other day i was walking home
i didn’t tell you
OH
that was it
i was at work
oh
fine in comparison to before
was just messing with you
i'm actually pretty fine
im fine, man. everything is spectacularly good.
how are you doing uti? enjoying being the ferrier of words, spreader of connection, deliverer of the MAIL?
the ball is in your hands
tell her whatever you want man
the true answer is not okay everything is terrible, but the answer i’m going to stick with henceforth is that i’m fine and that everything is spectacularly good.
have i made her worried somehow?
whats she worried about?
im worried now
:0
how you doin 
hi julia
look at this fuckin dumass destroying himself on the internet 
From what i’ve heard so far Martin is or was very recently a musical baby. i mean that his experiences with music haven’t come from much exploration and experimentation on his own. he listened to what was cool amongst his friends and what his parents liked and thought “yeah, this is it, this is the shit.” But, somewhat recently he’s finding music he likes and he’s interested in and he wants his opinions on these artists to be confirmed by the people around him. Thats why he asked what i some random ass dude who happens to be your best friend thought of that drop. Not for my honest opinion, but validation of his own. This speaks to a deeper insecurity that most, if not all people share. He currently lacks confidence in himself and his own choices. He shouldn’t have to ask, and he shouldn’t get upset when i say 7.5. Its a good song. That was the first thing I said about it, but either he didn’t hear that part, or someone didn’t tell him.
but now IM GONNA RAIN HELL ON HIS BOOL ASS
i assumed that was the case i just needed tone so i could know how to respond 
ALRIGHT LETS DO IT THEN
OH
i don’t know what to say here
you bitch
okay uti you didn’t answer my question 
i don’t know this mans i have no qualms with him. he obviously doesn’t know sigur ros yet so i put that one on you
uh, uti how am i supposed to take that? a compliment or an insult? i don’t know the tone it was said with
he insulted the gods
gtfo
LOL
but pretty sick if we’re only referencing like the rap/hiphop/rmb genre
sigur ros did it first
i argue 7 cause no buildup
i rate 7.5/10
was not expecting 
actually kinda dope
song
listen now
phone broke
who the fuck is martin
skype gets it
I do not share
we cant have 12 best drops of all time
so thats the problemo
y e a h
that ones a 10/10
son et lumiere to inertiatic
and then the uh
if you count the intro to the album as the drops
and lunacy
all lined up
but theres also
mother of the world
off the top
i can name 4
nuh uh
nope
...
im checking disco-fruitcake rn
good music 
but yeh
day 1 babyyy
noah gets it now
holy shit
just today?
really?
oh yeah that’s really good
if it was a run of 4 surrogate 2 would just make it even more perfect 
it’s perfect 
mellothumb provides a much needed rest between those two horrifying songs
but volcano-all lined up is just the superior option to me
thats my second best
yep
yep
volcano, mellothumb, all lined up
what?
its 10/10
it was fucking rarted
but like
i can't say that im upset at maisie williams nipples
i mean
yes
rest in peace game of thrones 
lmao
worst episode ever?
fucking
the dothraki run it down
holy shit
why is she in a library 
what
that’s disappointing 
c h r i s t
fucking
GREY WORM LIVES?
jon doesn’t die?
who
fucking t r a s h
youre kidding
wait
okok
ok
spoil it for me tbh i’m not even the slightest bit invested 
but yea
been at work all day
haven’t seen the new ep
it really is man
but i do know that this vid is top quality
i don't know what im doing with my life
so i’m kind of forced to give that shit a pass
a bunch of military grade, heavily armed, ai-driven spider mechs having tea parties and debating whether or not they have souls
but its stuff like
it does have a few joke episodes that kinda fuck with the pacing not because they’re in the middle of shit, but because they don’t add anything new to the plot.
it is
*hacks into their implants and shit
the show’s good, got a wild plot about body modification and a hacker who hacks into people to control them and make them commit assassinations and acts of terrorism
but yeah
its true but it doesn’t hold that much weight if we’re judging the individual value of each thing
i mean thats like saying star wars wouldn’t have existed without Dune
anime like
uhh
the story is very
akira is way overrated imo
than both imo
ghost in the shell is better
like uh, blade runner akira are the shell are basically the kings of the whole cyberpunk sci-fi scene
just cause theres more
but in terms of which i like more, probably the show.
the movie is fantastic 
back when i was like 8-9 and lucky had just been born
i remember staying up till like 2-3 am to watch that shit on adult swim on saturdays. 
the show is very good though 
maybe nostalgia 
these guys are losing their collective shits
cause the song is the opening for the ghost in the shell tv show
the song? or the sentiment?
because some of them actually do come back and comment every day
i think they’re serious 
They’re commenting every day. to prove that the song will never die
is the best comment section ever
on this song's video
i know it's weeby, but the comment section
but w/e butter basting makes anything taste good
i overcooked it
damb
i kinda liked 2004
well
that's probably about right
yeah
people don't do that shit and they end up with shitty steak
and plop your meat in there so a crust forms
get that shit ripping hot
if it's not thicc, just cook it in a pan
or you do that shit backwards
if it's big you either have to sear then put in an oven
when cooking a steak
ok
remember this shit
alright my steak has rested for like 4 hours im gonna cook this shit
dog was the best part
same
and karzani
and then lesovikk
the dog was the shit
with spinax
and then fucking maxilos
and hydraxon
they released gadunka
to top it off
and then
yeah
is awesome
who looks dumb as shit
even carapar
it's insane
there litrally isn't a single bad set in that year
idfk
the barraki were fucking nuts
im looking through them all
2007 is just objectively fantastic
i don't remember that one
2006 was underrated, u right
and then you could take all 3 and make kardas
vezon and fenrakk were dope too
*axonn
axon was the s h i t
oh right!
and he had a mohawk made of spikes
warmachine shoulder mounted ghetto blaster look going
cause he had the fucking
i think tbh the only toah that got outta that one alive was nuparu
in a great way
fuckin retarded
the piraka look
the matoran look retarded
looked so fuckin weird man
just
idk i think the sets
thok
bruh piraka
and iruni
if not 2003 than maybe 2005 just cause keetongu
really fuckin good
and i don't mean the shell outside thing i mean the insides
with their heads and spine pieces
they also have some of the best parts
yeah 2003 was based
Oh right, and takanuva
and honestly, i think the rakshi are my second favorite set line after the 2001 toa
then makuta, jaller and the bird, takua and the crab
then the rakshi
had the og matoran revamps
nobody thinks of 2003 afaik
maybe 2003
???
underrated
thats hard
hmm
uh
and i know how to make it
i want meat
so i have the time for that
i also got off work early as fuck
have finally broke me
all these cooking youtube videos
for a cut of steak that you’re gonna cook yourself 
which is a lot
to cook tonight 
i just went and bought a 15 dollar cut of ribeye
...
rip
oh right
oh my are you starting to understand the meme value of skype auto-response?
Will do!
Thank you very much!
OK then
LOL
lmao
that said i like noah enough that i’d totally do it anyway 
and while that not a point against him, it is a thing.
he’s kinda boolish
also
idk how noah would handle that
it’d be a long ass time, and i’d just be staying in youth hostels 
lmao
why’s he not having you work in groups that focus on different things?
that said
thats some top notch shit
the old one
like look at thief
i think art has a pretty big impact on level design 
lul
yeah that shits rough
oh wait does this mean you’re modeling shit in 3d now?
to use?
which one is more fun?
ah ok
which engine is the one that dominates the market rn?
like absolver 
lots of things are made in unreal
yeah
unreal?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
thats cool though
FUUUUUUUCCCCKKKK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
you wanna come with?
and apparently everyone i know thinks its a fantastic idea
im also thinking of taking a year to just travel europe and be poor as shit
and now we’re cool and she wants me to move to texas with her
for instance, i went and told my sister all the shit i told you like 2 days ago
deets deets deets
uti ur killin me, i need those deets without the deets i’ll die man. gimme the deets, wassup, how you feeling what’s stressful, what’s not?
So what have you been up to?
Yeah, I guess
i hope
just to do better in the box offices
not like to the point where he’ll just slap his name on whatever, but enough that he’ll pull all his punches 
i think he likes getting paid just a bit more than he likes making top-tier movies
cause there aren’t any interviews where he isn’t super proud of the outcome of the movies
idk i just think that jordan peele is a normie himself
HOLLYWOOD: MAKE EVERYTHING ACCESSIBLE 
yes
yep its like he wrote the dad dying
any other outcome is complete bullshit
like in Us, The Dad should have been killed on that boat
yeah
The cops showing up and shooting chris would be fucking awesome 
 boom instantly more intense and suddenly his character has a purpose that isnt TSA ex machina
but if they killed him as soon as he shows up instead of him saving the day or some shit
esp with the tsa guy
As it stands it kind of pussies out and loses its tension 
I think, similar to Us it’s a movie that would have greatly benefited if one of all of the protagonists died
I can get behind that
when it's pretty obvious that they couldn't talk because they never learned how to communicate with one another, and were just shambling around like zombies. ofc they can't speak.
and one of them was that the air was different and they couldn't breathe the air correctly
like i've heard six different theories on why the underground people can't talk
what I DO like about the movie is all the fucking idiots that have been trying to theory craft on youtube
as is it just isn't scary
rather than a typical horror movie
but it'd have to be structured as a comedy, or a slasher thriller
actually maybe yeah that'd be dope
unless you mean the part where they kill the friend's family and they start fighting over how many kills everyone has
idk i wouldn't have liked it if the whole thing was the middle campy section
its tone is more consistent 
get out is better
i did like the imagery of the hands across america thing
yeah
i don't think he really knew how he was going to end the movie
yeahhhh
kids being derps and getting bodied by inanimate objects because of it is my favorite genre out there
yup
share in my suffering
and this is *i haven't eaten yet todya
but i've spent like 20 minutes just watching cooking videos on youtube
i haven't eaten yet
there's gotta be something wrong with me
fucjking
huh
i see
especially the random letters one
cause some of the search functions look fake
actually i'm starting to think that it just randomly generates letters around the phrase you type
the search function makes this very cool
it's just not coherent
it's in there
the library of babel?
what is this?
uh
and it’s almost done, so i wanted to see what it looked like
and i saw when the building got demolished 2 years ago
i walk by it on my way to work every day
spider sense was nutty
i see, at beach life
but he’s still kind of a dick
but he’s still kind of a dick
which like, fair
tried  after and he didn’t respond 
i forgot i had weed on me, coulda used that as a peace offering 
then watched me back away through a window
the dude followed me all the way to the fence i hopped to get out
and i fucked right outta there
i was tryna figure out how to get up the stairs when i felt this weird tingle and turned to find the guy standing like 15 feet away staring at me
and found a fucking guy who was squatting there
i just climbed into a construction site i’ve been wanting to check out
but theres a line in there that says “y’all can’t even hear me you just wanna dance” which is probably the point of the song
well the song is about a breakup
which is literally about how nobody is listening to what andre is saying
by outkast
hey ya
like uh
it has all the substance ans subtleties, but the song isn’t actively trying to hide them
its very upfront and frank about the fact that its sad as shit
wheras the 2011 doesn’t have that
it’s really easy to get lost in the music and tone of voice and not realize that the song is sad af
to me all the happy flairs reminds me of like all the constant pretending and acting like I wasn’t depressed, while the lyrics are what’s actually going on beneath the surface 
the 2018 beach life in death is more sad than the 2011 one
controversial opinion to yours
ok
and is fire
shitpostbot 9000 exists
they were right
holy shit
here
didnt have sound ;-;
you made me do it
nice
oh
is that the actual song from the chipmunks movie slowed down?
wassup?
oi
okay
holy shit
is dancing so happy
i like that husky
&lt;3
the husky
yes
but its fantastic 
can’t send rn since not home
i like that dog that dances
im just not a fair judge
i know
truth is, the game was rigged from the start.
and like it aint his fault 
its not even close
that mr bubs could beat cleo
there was no way
regardless
its one of those chaotic evil vine comps
well its in them
that sounds about right
oh last august?
well it was made before that, then
that first clip is in a lot of vine compilations 
no thats the same dog
why the fucks he so mad
hes the dog from the fucking vines
skeptical 
cursed af

michael started watching jojo a bit ago
i think im leaving that group chat
i think im leaving that group chat
alright
does your wife know you’re saying this shit?
first of all who the fuck are you talking to?
like
i been trying to make u love me
we gon make this
we gon get this
doesn’t bother even saying money anymore, just “this”
he barely uses any nouns that arent i, you, we, or them.
it’s funny 
you should try it
to read those lyrics plainly, without any inflection
i told him
he pasted the lyrics to ghost town
its bullshit
that just further proves my point
exactly 
in general kanye is a pretty dry well when it comes to emotional depth, but he went from having some meaning, to none whatsoever in yeezus and pablo, and now he’s looped back around to pretending to have some sort of meaning in ye and kids see ghosts, because he finally realized that most people who aren’t monkeys or hoes don’t really want to listen to him jerk his dick on a concert stage.
then this
i said he peaked with graduation
he said fuck you, quoted lyrics in all caps
i said fuck kamye
but the boy do be stupid
i think i won
its just i was arguing with michael about fucking kanye
i know
too few with the balls to take the hard road be their own artists
there are so many people out there who want to be rap music producers 
ofc
i mean yeah producers really just commission their shit to whoever would buy it makes sense
oh
i mean i can’t say for sure cause i haven’t looked it up
he’s got the money for solid producers
j cole?
fuck them by proxy
they’re weak pussy boys because they’re working for j cole
fuck his producers
i know
okay
or post malone
like j cole
actually i’ll beat the modern rap outta you
man i swear if you ever get into modern rap im gonna beat the shit outta you
i know ymo
so like soundbath wave shit?
oh ok
like depesche mode?

does it make you wanna rip your spine out of your own ass?
does it melt your brain?

for the next 10 years
every year
its banger of the year
i had to walk dogs for a while sorry i dropped out
DESTROY THE GREAT ENEMY CALLED I! 

IÄ!   IÄ!
i’ll send you off with my favorite quote ever written:
exactly like that, no punctuation 
tell julia mars says hi hows it hanging
GOOD POINT
OKAY
if that doesn’t work they might get violent and if they get violent then you’ve won
but, that’s really only with guys, girls usually go for your ego when they try to hurt you
you might fight because you might say something too strong on accident and you’ll have to defend yourself 
you won’t fight, because when someone says something hurtful to you, it won’t affect you, because you don’t care what they think about you, you only care what you think of them and what they think of themselves a
and your own words are twice as devastating 
if you do that, nothing anyone says can touch you
the whole point is getting rid of your own ego
and if you do, you still don’t think about what they think of you, you just make it up to them
if you care about what they think of themselves and pay attention, and remember it. you won’t say anything wrong and hurtful
i beg to differ
so in all honesty there are no downsides to it.
but if you don’t care what others think, then that won’t really matter either
but it could, you’ll just kind of have to deal with getting pinned as an asshole
i don’t know for sure if it applies in school
id say that when on a date with someone, or asking her on a date, her opinions of you don’t matter in the slightest, so all you have to pay attention to are the things she likes and play those up. the opinions that matter are everything else. things that she likes, things she doesn’t like, people she likes, people that she would like. and then there are her opinions of herself which are most important.
but i think, in the mars’s asshole guide to random women book that i might write
well to some extent yeah
ah
or like once you talk to them
yeah the ones who you’re stuck in a room with
imo
you shouldn’t care what strangers think
thats like workplace relationships i guess. not that different from school relationships, but you get to play the, “i don’t care im just here to get paid card.”
especially when i don’t.
then, even harder is asking questions, trying to show that i care and want to know things about them even when i don’t 
so that i know what details are going where and who they’re being shared by
pay attention to what i’m saying
people at work i need to be on guard and shit
strangers don’t matter. their opinions hold no weight because  I’m probably never going to see them again and even if i do we won’t recognize each other
i’m worse at interacting with people that i know then I am with strangers tbh
i fucking love this album btw
no half-assing, or going just to try and sleep with her.
i do plan on actually listening to her.
humor is the wrong word there
which will help me decide if i want to sit down and actually write this book that i’ve been talking about right now or put it off and make the instagram account instead.
for me its an opportunity to practice being a r.o.p. with complete strangers.
she asked me, I said maybe, then she played it off as a business opportunity thing and i decided that if she was gonna go that far then i’d humor her.
hmm
she came off as very unsure of herself 
i only had 2 shots.
2 not that i can remember 
1 not really 
hmm
And now I have to do it because thats the price of being a real and open person
In my defense, i really needed to destress. I made stupid plans to meet this girl who gave me a ride home from work on Sunday at starbucks.
throw morality to the wind and piss on a freeway
i wouldn’t do it again, mostly cause i’m not that much of a fucking asshole, but you should do it at least once.
i probably hit like 3 cars
shit was awesome 
i pissed off the edge of overpass over the 101 last night
and just walk the whole way back
so the tuesday ritual is now to pub crawl from work to home
my week starts friday and ends tuesday 
wed is the start of my weekend my guy
my hangover made me think that i was looking for a band called pacemaker.
okay
ohh
is it this song?
yeah they put that fund goal in the dirt
oh you checked it out
the art is fuckin dope
I think you’d like the game, even if you don’t get to play it
when it finishes, I’ll send you my pdf of it
The fuckin kickstarter for that tabletop game Lancer just came out
oh ok
not continuous
the rest of the games are only loosely connected
i’d really only worry about playing dark souls in order
so it doesn’t affect stats
so it doesn’t affect stats
but the leveling system is weird souls leveling
you lose money and exp when you die
now i have 72
man, i had nearly a thousand bucks before i fought lady butterfly 
i can see the appeal
but after playing through bloodborne like
thats a little nutty
this is the correct tier list
but i learned about the boneashe’d cannon thing and oneshot the whole game
i played bloodborne 
you should try it if you get the chance
but good
kinda weeby
its good game
and just steamrolled her
yeah i figured out the shuriken thing
uhh
wait after i sent that i beat her in 2 mins
thats some bullshit
tell him i said, fuck lady butterfly 
if so
did noah buy sekiro?
yikes
which
silver soul is a better song
cool
but they sampled it, played it backward and sped it up
i forgot what money trees sounded like
oh listened to both songs again 
what do you think of ricardo?
ur face is sick
i’ll have to listen when im off work cause i don’t remember money trees off the toppa my head
ic
tbh i don’t recognize it still
oh cool
i don’t know of that one
what's up?
anyway yep, hype
and they're not wrong
the best part is that they think my character is just a massive horny fuckboi who just wants to smash anything with two legs
and it worked
i been planning this shit since like early february
fuck man
but the dice just said "yes. we believe you."
i've never pulled so many barefaced lies out of my ass in my life
you should
and if you haven't played one
dnd is best played as a high charisma character
i think this goes to show that
and now we're gonna murder the fucking lady that we were hired to make sure didn't get attacked. for money.
i managed to get the fucking dnd group to join the mafia
IT WORKED
i can't believe i haven't seen this shit before
ofc, neither is get out, but get out is a psych thriller, and not a horror movie 
not scary
its just
and better music
i will add, us has better art direction and imagery
Oh
you should watch get out
yeah
mostly cause it's not scary
but the first like 5/6s of the movie are just kind of "eh"
and it gets much much better toward the end
it's alright
i wouldn't see it in theaters had i known anything about it
yea here
and that shit looks like it'll be fantastic
called Midsommar
there was a trailer for Ari Aster's new movie
in the fuckin previews
DUDE
but OH
nothing like hereditary or mandy
us is like a 2000s horror movie though
but the writing and acting is better
jordan peele has a sort of m. night problem where he makes plots that are full of twists for no goddamn reason
very specifically the second half
lupita nyongo is fantastic in the second half of it though
get out is better sort of
it's fine
have you seen us?
yeah
henry, does coffee make you poop?
does coffee make you poop?
does coffee make you poop, henry?
ttyl, night
lol arright
didn't you just describe a big tiddy goth gf?
wait
so
that said she's kind of a basic bitch
half asian half irish
at my job
i could introduce you to rynn
is that the ideal?
lmao
skype is here for you
I can tell
yeah no problemo
ezpz
just make a final project that's so good that her panties immediately disintegrate on the spot and she sucks your dick right there
i have an addition
actually
i think it's foolproof
i like it
so you move on to step 2 and kill her boyfriend
if she isn't, then she's quality gf material
if she's with it, then don't date her
that's what an alpha would do, boyfriend be damned
slide in there and put your dick in it anyway
my advice is simple
and who is this girl?
miffed that she has a bf?
no.
how could you.
lost boys?
fuck you
cause he doesn’t stop
i’ll be honest i can’t watch past the halfway point on those videos 
holy shit
not yet
lmao
did you ever watch that space station 13 video?
NOW
so i can use as comp background 
yes send me pdfs
but
i do know moebius
yes the fuck it is
2. oh shit man hype hype
1. ty vm my guy
yep im good
would be hype
hopefully with friends tho
yup
not the best
i think i was really just scared by that fuckin acid trip man
which is both kind of funny and kind of depressing
reading it now, it just comes off as angsty bullshit
now that im not high anymore
but
i was shlept
i’ve got nothing to do today
yeah
then i’ll send
and then take a shower
gotta take cleo for a quick walk
doing so rn
yeah man
got cleo in here
yep
yeah
though i don’t know who to
and i might give one away if thats the case
if not than just me
only to a few people
around 
not
but
i think i’ll offer it around 
don’t know
people mostly 
including myself 
everything?
*it
and this helped to release some of ot
i harbor a lot of anger all the time
but idk
that might make a bit more sense with the short page i wrote
uh
locking myself in a room and dealing with it
that was the whole purpose of buying the acid
i say better out than in
yeah
so i couldn’t have slept if i wanted
like a lot of it
actually i feel like buzzed on caffine
i feel fine
its like an 8 hour thing
didn’t start kicking in until 10:56 
i took it at 10:09
mhm
without the words though
like really loud
i was hearing a lotta death grips beats
man it was wild though 
yeah
enough for 2 small outings or one big one
*4 more
5
well
i got a lot
a dude i know
which wasn’t noiseless, but it was way less than my aunt so whatever 
i kept noise to a minimum 
like i made sure not to step out of my room
you’re pretty in charge of major decisions 
Yeah, I have
I am going to do it
stay right here and chill out
i just need to fuckin
sweet
might be in an hour
i get up
i’ll send it when
sure
or just without the rhythm its not so stressful 
i toned it down i think while writing 
what i wrote
worse in my head
it was also
sounds great
At least thats how i think people would abuse it
it’s definitely a drug where you take it and you go have sex with someone 
that might be my own problem 
idk
and for the rest of it i was trying to strangle myself so
most of it that i was king of the world
it felt for like
so everything feels nutty
every nerve in your body’s like firing off though
its hard to tell
maybe a good amount 
or
only a bit
i hallucinated like
but there was a rhythm to everything that didn’t stop
it was hard to describe 
it was like uh
like maybe an hour ago
and im pretty sure i nodded off for a sec
very different from last night 
coming down
cause you don’t get to sleep
it’s probably cooler with other things to focus on
hmm
and yeah that’s probably a good idea
you don’t gotta apologize for being asleep or taking your time to answer, my man
and im writing some shit that im afraid to show people, but not afraid to show you because you are my best friend.
i've got like 4 more doses of it
on acid right now
im
at a point where you don't want to handle it.
fuck you up
answer truthfully please, because I don't want to like
emotionally
how much are you able to handle right now?
hey
no
what the fuck
i never beat it
same
tho
legs
with
guns
YOU SEE THIS BORDERLANDS 3 TRAILER?
HOLY SHIT
so i’ll probably just stick to my 1 post a day routine 
but idk, i’ve never gotten anything out of seeing what other people are doing
maybe those thots gagging on bananas on the internet 
maybe my friends 
i don’t think i’d really spend any time looking at other people’s shit
in moderation i guess
its good to just post stuff 
but whatever 
then a week later they just assume i have one and get their dumbass instagram jokes
cause shit, i don’t have any social media and when i bring that up people literally cannot comprehend
mostly to establish yourself as part of the world 
yeah its good 
fair enough 
so somewhere out there there’s a mars sleeps with no pictures whatsoever 
i had one made for me that i forgot the password to
thanks 
lmao
you only answered one of the questions, ya dingus
but this is a real question that i been thinking about for a while.
sor
wow that came off strong
2. SHOULD I MAKE ONE PURELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADVERTISING MYSELF 
1. DO YOU HAVE AN INSTAGRAM?
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT 
AY
hows it hangin?
oi
r i p
i ended up missing ToS, eh?
i’m always down for TOS
but if you’re still playing when i get home
im not home
and you're gonna playtest it
im gonna have you get... 4 of your friends
*done
when it's doone
but anyway
cause that game looks like elder god-tier stuff
i think it's fucking gold
but honestly it's better as a standalone game
that was loosely based around dnd
because he wanted my help in designing a tabletop game based on it
parsa showed me that video
so
:0
this looks like the most amazing game
Yeah, I guess
randomly looked up to see this too
and it’s adorable 
and now shes a stick again
i got cleo a haircut 
we can save it, too
which isn't a big deal for me
it just means that you don't get to ask questions
I'll need to say two lines for vica, and one action for sussett though. 
i definitely don't.
actually
i probably don't need you there for it
but that's fair
k
but not drunk drun
always
well
nope
the prologue is neon stuff
so you want the scene?
then dw bout it
yuh
i'd just tell you what vica knows
we don't have to do it.
It was gonna be Neon laying out the info she has for you
it'd happen in the next scene
the unnecessary shit within the unnecessary shit within the unnecessary shit would have been a short thing involving vica
just the prologue
what's the game?
oh dope
dank
also
is it movie night?
what you doin?
:O
how busy are you?
oh
and do some unnecessary shit
for me to go
it's time
alright
yuh
yeah i figured 
i still havent tried vr anything 
cool
like occulus shit
right
virtual reality?
and that is
what kind of hw?
so dw
i literally just remembered as well
o o f
OI
we doin this shit?
ITS THURSDAY MY DUDE
OH
PH
like around the halfway point they stopped trying to make jokes, and instead just. stop... talking entirely?
if they had tryharded the writing a bit more it’d have been better 
and tbh it wasn’t as funny as i remembered 
i just rewatched it last night
the room does exist
but
if the room didn't exist it would be the most retarded movie ever made
movie where the guy shoots up a police station through a phone
the fucking
ez
kung fury
second best
shit
BEST MEME MOVIE EVER MADE GO
ALRIGHT
RED
fuck kingdom hearts
true true
oh right
gave that shit a 4
dunkey thinks so
the world has turned on its head
apparently devil may cry 5 is really good
your mom is the best bassline
lmao
whats up
noah knows
ofc
you already saw it?
ech
is a ride
this fucking movie
no country for old men
but like, jett's his brother. and jett is a terrible influence.
i'll do my best to keep him on the path of non-degeneracy
weeblo
he's attained a new form
that's the end of our boy as we know him
yeah
like when he was watching eva and samurai champloo
but tbh im pretty sure milo started turning into a weeb a while ago
inane bullshit
and then a lot more are just
some animes can be cool, as long as they're appreciated for what they are
i think it's fine
buying figurines
and as long as he isn't like
as long as that's not the only thing he does with his time
i mean
eh
i wasn’t planning on saying anything to him about it anyway 
jk
im gonna tell him ALLLLLLL THIS
you can’t 
he had his whole life ahead of him
the literal moment
i saw the moment he changed his profile picture to the anime girl
yeah
yeah the sound is rough
LET ME IN
oh they do
oh
this video is satan in the wait
isn't guest house
this video
guest house is fucking sick
is that a guest house video?
the jadis book will be wild
w/o that sickass hat
yeah the outfit is lame
ah
the hat is fuckin incredible
yeah
but
i think her being ugly is the point
oh shit the next page of ksbd is gonna be hype
cause its more bm
no i’ll just barrage you
you think somethings fucked up with the streaming or smth
ecstasy is fucking sick too
you get used to the silence
big pp song
yeah that song is big
but i do like this motherfucker
i don’t normally like screaming
also the album laugh tracks by knocked loose
but its all good
thats my favorite song on the album
i who have nothing by liquid smoke
here
i will
nah
?
noah is a man with taste
good
f u c k i n    s i c k
noah likes daughters?
did you see em today?
thats who im lookin out for
daughters and iceage
i plan on it
yeah its super good
that sounds awful tho
cause it sounds so shitty
i never got that far
real good man
its fuckin
yeah
sober to death 2018 fucking sucks man that shit feels bad
he did some extra things with the guitar line that i sorely miss in the 2011 version 
i think i actually like 2018 beach life in death better
o i
yeah i can probably do friday morning 
yeah thats some crazy shit
idk its tough
yeah its sick
pretty sure i sent it to you a while ago
interference fits by perfect pussy
but thats cause i like my sad shit to sound happier
than both
i think in terms of lo-fi noisy songs i like interference fits more
hmm its hard
i think
still
yeah for sure
i missed the whole line on the high fi one
actually yeah
cause i like the clearer instrumentals
for beach life in death it’s actually pretty close
hmm 
cause you can just listen to the old one
i mean its fine
and made it worse
he just took the old album
yeah but
the new one sucks
fuckin spotify had me on the new one
wait
I. DONT. WANT. TO. GO. IN-SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNEEEEE
it’s really good
beach L-I-D
yeah
this song is better than nervous young inhumans
and i HATE it
is for : /
that emote
on skype
what the FUCK is this face
:/
it doesnt have the voice filter
no but
actually it might just be the filter on the vocals that does it for me
i also love nervous young inhumans
absolutely destroyed, sorry man
GET GOT
this song is sick
how did sober to death take any getting used to
i really need to stop hanging out here for 3 hours after my shift
those who can extrapolate from incomplete data
there are two types of people
you know
yup
and mumble rappers
is a person
cause taylor swift
no
well
y e a h
Yeah, it happens
its up in the air
so
idk i like imogen heap
and that aint me brother
for bitches who arent metal
softie club music
cause its like
but i never thought i’d like the other shit
i’ve always unironically liked multi love
as far as umo
i mean
sun ra is the shit tho
way too many
cause i don’t listen to it
i just don’t usually give it the chance
oh for sure
at my job they play fuckin unknown mortal orchestra all the damn time, and now that shits grown on me
oh you know what
other artists 
got distracted with
past that i actually haven’t listened to any other albums 
its the best song on there
ecstasy
wo
from your nothing, literally just listen to ecasty
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ehhhh
but their new stuff is better anyway
but the old stuff is more hardcore post punk
their newer albums are closer to  nick cave
oh
but im pretty sure his voice is just his voive
im sure nick cave is an inspiration for the style
whot
huh
is very quickly 
which.
i listen to music in the same way that i go clothes shopping i guess
i don’t got the patience for that
wot
and I know of nick cave but haven’t actually seached out to listen to him
so im wondering if you like, listen to songs that you don’t like, on purpose to double check, or if they just come on randomly cause they’re saved
and thats it
i never listen to it again ever
cause usually after i don’t like a song
i still don’t get how things happen to grow on you
imma be honest
just gotta be sure
and not the new one?
when you were saying that
so the old one is the one you’re talking about 
so does the old one have your favorite songs?
oof
one from 2011 and one from 2018
also why are there 2 twin fantasies in their discography
i was tryna remember them
oh i haven’t listened to them since you sent that playlist 
i c
really 
it got kinda busy
nw
yeah
AAAAAAAAAASA
AAAA
i require human contact through my cellular device 
its dead here at my job
Ay 
Ay ma mans
Ay 
SKRRRAATTATATAT
KAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAKA
SKKKKKRRRRRAAAT
yuh
disguised as a weeb
is a god
this guy
the first comment is golden 
here
(sad)
Yeah, I guess
weekends i can never be too sure
on most wednesdays and thursdays, yuh
alright no prob
R E E E E
we doin this shit?
*this coming thursday 
so next thursday 
or are stupid 
and the rest probably either gave up
i figure, most of them probably died in that fight
and use those campaigns to introduce people to k6bd
anyway ever since reading k6bd all i want to do is steal from it to make dnd campaigns 
then i’ll just be hyped until the gog-agog one
in general i think this solomon book will most definitely be better than the mammon one
from the fight in the vault
it’s gonna be interesting to see how that plot line with allison’s pursuers turned out 
maya for sure went through some shit
yeah definitely
it’s happened a bit
as far as characters that i’m the most hyped to see, it’s pretty much always maya
but
i actually don’t know who out of them i like more
the reincarnation numbers provide a lot of insight into the angel’s characters 
i also gotta hand it to em
nah, white chain sick
i was like oh shit
and then blocks the sword with her fucking pinkie
delicious 
that first time when white chain fights fuckin
its so sick
pretty much exactly what needed to happen
white chain teaching allison martial arts is
im glad white chain is back though
yeah it kinda pissed me off
well they have tie-ins to the world
oh absolutely 
yeah
then maybe 8 pages of rest or travel time where development isn’t being made before the next 100 pages
so you end up with 100 pages of constant go-time with maybe 2-3 pages spaces out where it slows down a bit
the comic/graphic novel medium is really bad for displaying like the passage of time
in terms of pacing it’s not a bad move
but i like the timeskip
it also gets better the more devil characters are added and killed
i think the base story only gets better as allison gets more competent
but yeah
i love the first het one, too
yeah that one is a 10/10
oh prim leaves her father’s house?
which one?
the short stories really make the whole thing
me too my dude
oh easily
yeah the pacing IS really fast
i c
*mammon
senile old dragon mammom
fucking
fucking, maya
fucking, incubus in allison’s fucked up head
oh my god what’d you think
:0
im available thursday 
when are you available?
hmm
you just get to know it’s happening 
you don’t get to see it
am back at making playlists 
and
i’ve been hype for the rp
lmao
but yeah
there are enough players for there to be a meta
not that
so its cool they get some time at the top of the meta
it used to be really bad
i thought game would die before i got the chance
and its trippy
also i’m very nearly at gold doritos
so im happy
but yeah now im back to whooping some high tier ass
the adjusted stun values mean the best style in the game is the fucking drunken master style so i had to build around that bullshit
and it’s fuckin awesome
but i just made a new one on monday
but my old deck was trash and it made me sad
like 3 weeks ago
most of them are still gone tho
some of em
jabsolver aint a thing anymore 
stun values work
they fixed it
but now
had to make a new deck
the absolver patch is surprisingly nice
wassup
AYYY
i don’t know how i found this but now i’m hooked
watch as toni bou d e s t r o y s  the competition 
w u t
what a shirt 
what the fuck
holy shit
jfc
found
cant find
oh
old?
it’s probably some govt shit
so i didn’t open
its for my aunt
no more rn
boggles the fucking mind
get the dumbest mail
i always
to place all over your game?
do they have [SAMPLE TEXT]
LENS FLARE
dicking around makes everything more enjoyable
sweet
is it?
fun
oh
what you up to
wassup?
lol
REAL NIGGA HOURS
you're getting into those
it's almost 3am for you man
it's true
if you don't listen to other things in between
yeaah you can
is so good
cause mchngrl vs wlfgrl
machine girl way too much
i been listening to fuckin
yeah
anyway
yeah
cause that's not the best idea
and i'll no longer try to set any expectations
cause it's good
about the comic
anyway i won't say shit
whoops
...
and then say nothing?
i say alright
did
alright
juggernaut is metal as shit
fucking rides a motorcycle made of literal burning human bodies
that dude is the shit
fuck yeah
you got to juggernaut star
OH
oof
you did me one better
so
i couldn't buy hiveswap
check out whatever he does next
uh
i mean i'll still
rip
a better comic than andrew hussie's shit started in his forum lol
yeah
really
it started on the mspa forums
perish right into gog agog's face
OH
you're at what allison's waking up from falling asleep?
but yeah
i got about there on my first night and was fucking dying
i fucking lost it at that
the fucking singing
dude vladok is cool as shit
also halfway hmm
drinking contest
how'd you like the uh
wot
k6bd?
have you gotten any farther in k6
whoops
eugh
i don't for some reason
*flies
but like
i'd probably rate the album higher if i liked files and black paint
by far
my favorite song on there is the fear
it do
its got some poppers
wow
damn
year of the snitch is high
yeah mang
cause that's some death grips shit
and did whatever they wanted
i assume they just said fuck it
who knows
yeah
i mean the two halves vs 1 another
but idk it doesn't reaaaaally stand a chance
kind of a big draw
which is like
doesn't have pss pss though
which is easily my fav song on that album
and fuck me out
and billy not really
such as up my sleeves
it's got goldies
yeah disc 1 tptb is fire
up my sleeves is dope
my whole FUCKIN life
MY WHOLE LIFE
my whole FUCKIN life
MY WHOLE LIFE

but
he's not crap yet
well
cause you know where he wen
everything leaves a sour taste
kendrick been overrated since damn
eh

but fuck you
and i know it's yacks

NIGGA?

BEND DOWN
(headbang)
(morningafter)
 (puke)
Ahoy!
O I
best games ever
and ttt
and then prop hunt
practically endless shit
10 dollars for fucking
gmod is dope though
oh right
and neither was pubg
but at the time csgo wasn't
and cs go now
so's dota
yeah
stayed relevant throughout all thst shit
yeah
wow pub g came in and slaughtered cs:go and dota
prep your balls
so
and book 2 opens with the best scene fucking ever
dude book 1 is basically an extended prologue
oh
i love it
she's so dumb
oh yeah
and YISUN is a batshit insane motherfucker
because the god is YISUN
it's hard to describe how good all the side stuff is
there's like
the side stuff is so fucking good
i know
yeah it's fucking awesome
already
nice
going through and reading them all now, they don't provide much context for the story going on, but there are some uh elaborate expository drawings that feature characters that are only mentioned in the stories, and if you read them you'll probably recognize the characters. which is kinda cool, but not like imperative or anything
because Meti is the shit
and pretty much anything involving Meti
most of the short ones
there are a few of the text supplements that are worth reading
if you haven't started K6bD
just gonna point out that
oh
the fuckin kingdom hearts one is fucking hilarious too
dude this guy has some absolute goldies
did i only show you the mario kart one?
oh
throwback
wow fuckin
anyway yeah that's what im doing rn
still
actually it might be around that
no thats incorrect
you've got a 7% chance of instant death by teleportation
the funniest fucking thing
and i think that is just
has a passive teleport, where as a full action you roll 3d6 and can move that many spaces, but if you roll triples, you disappear and just don’t reappear.
and the one im reading rn
called cores
all the mechs have once per session super abilities 
like this one
some of the designs really scream eva
and it's made by the same guy who made K6BD
y e s
dnd is a game system
or vtm
or shadowrun
or like uh warhammer
like 5e
that you run games through
it's a tabletop game system
this is long dick advertising 
i would buy a car from big bill hell’s
not when you’ve got a mech called the ISP-Northstar “Blackbeard” and it looks like this
eh its not a huge problem
you can make a bunch of planets and stuff, but all the mechs and equipment will be coming from the same corporations with the same stories behind them
you can make a bunch of planets and stuff, but all the mechs and equipment will be coming from the same corporations with the same stories behind them
*origins.
the problem that i can see here is that it doesn’t really allow for much world building. cause everything in the book is so specific and has specific origind
i cant describe it, fuck
so its very cool
and theres a fuckton of parts to build them out of
except the mechs are modular
and i figure story shit is always as cool or interesting as your imagination, but combat usually sucks
*combat
like half the game is story shit and the other half is mech combad
im getting ahead of myself
there’s never a point where things aren’t cool
is so good
just the flavoring for everything
yeah its the name of the system
holy fucking shit LANCER is the coolest fucking game
and it pretty much never lets you down
and the comment section is almost always filled with like a massive cult of roleplaying fanboys discussing each page
those are worth reading
there are short text pieces that are not giant walls of text, though. 
and that you'd already missed some
im dumb i thought you were talking about the hover text
OH
oh ok
did you start it already?
that might save you some time if you want to catch those
where when you hover your mouse on them it says something
also a shitton of the pages have that hover text
it's all supplementary though
but there is a little bit of foreshadowing in there sometimes
none of it adds context
well
no
and it's the sort of stuff that you'll end up reading twice over
theres just too much stuff
and just come back to it later
honestly it's probably safer to avoid reading all the side lore, though a lot of it is really really fucking good
np
which i kind of regret
i missed that page and was linked the first page of the comic
there's nothing you can do.
*competition
i mean, this is the cover art of your competitio
well
and nothing stands even half a chance
but after that initial period, i think it's the best art for any comic ever made
the art took me a sec to get used to
alright sweet
i love it
skype is rarted
Thanks for reading!
what's up where'd you go?
okay now my anxiety is kicking in
im of the opinion that it is the current best work of pure creativity that we might see for the next 50 years
im of the opinion that it is the current best work of pure creativity that we might see for the next 50 years
what the fuck
fucking great wall of text of china
boom
scroll down?
wow that's a lot of text and a lot of drawing
right?
just look at the page
absolutely
here lemme send you this
pages of worldbuilding lore and side stories on every other fucking page
god DAMN, im going back and rereading kill 6 billion demons now, and there are just
as you can see, im very worried that cyberpunk 2077 is gonna suck dick
you have to put it into systems to calculate the possible responses and that's a lot of time and work that nobody REALLY wants to do, for something that the majority of people and reviewers will gloss over to instead talk about how cool the shooting people and the flashy lights were
cause you can't just have action and reaction
but i guess that's why videogame rpgs will never be as good as freeform tabletop rpgs
and i love it
sounds like a harry potter spell
that
morality is easy, just make the player feel like an asshole.
it just makes you hallucinate and shoot kids.
and it doesn't have a system for it.
spec ops: the line aparently does morality right
morality systems are lame. real life doesn't care about morality
That's what I meant
but every indie developer and their mothers wants to be earthbound, so it's got something there
i haven't played it
earthbound is apparently not shallow
and there aint nothing that can fix that shit
either way the game, as a whole, is shallow
i think that's kind of black and white in and of itself.
and you do have to murder every single thing to get the bad ending
you do have to spare every single thing to get the good ending
true
but fuck, if halo can do it with their story, than anything can. 
a lotta games have that problem
none of the fights and mechanics are particularly fun or interesting enough to make you want to play it again after you know all the story beats.
like
i will say, that aside from the multiple endings, undertale has zero replayability
so im not takin points off for it
but i liked undertales mixture of the game mechanics into the game canon in general
i liked the rainbow hearts
you can
and it's definitely less anime as it is cartoony
i don't mind that campy shit too much
well when the hearts are symbols for the other kids souls or whatever its fine
it's fun
nah it aint cheesy
cause it's the best one
i generally assume that the real ending is the neutral one
i forget about the pacifist ending
oh right
and they get away with it cause the games are old and had very small cult fanbases
but a lot of things draw heavily on earthbound and cave story
undertale is supposed to be campy though
i figured it was something like that
are you just playing the first? or the whole shebang?
they do be time consuming
yeah it's cool
mostly in the looks department
reminds me a bit of evangelion too
cause it's a mecha game
yeah
except better
and it reminds me a lot of titanfall and apex legends
looking at a tabletop game made by the same guy who made K6BD
i was actually
yeah i did notice that
yeah you'll be fine
that i crave
but it doesn't have that titanfall movement and skill expression
it's actually a really good game
cause it's a good fuckin game
it will be
and i don't know if i'll ever get over it
and im still salty
and apex is very much not titanfall
cause i like titanfall
i don't like apex
also i think absolver might have my favorite art for a vinyl, ever and i'm so fucking upset that it's sold out.
also, is it weird that all my favorite games have sountracks made by austin wintory? does that mean i'm really just the most predictable motherfucker out there?
which is fucking awesome
and on the other, porting fucking journey to PC
on one hand, they stole spellbreak from steam, which is the only battle royale i was interested in playing
im at a loss of what to think of epic games rn
nah, by like the summer
well
i'm probably gonna drop out of it anyway, in a few weeks
kinda rough
but yeah
mostly me working
it's been for a multitude of different reasons
y e a h
hasn't been going for the past three weeks
it
he's pretty cool
the dude who runs the game is named kevin
the better one
so
not eric's
first mission completed too, without breaking a sweat
then we could do a favor for them in exchange for them not assassinating our employer council member's friend and wow
and boom, mafia are our best friends
we just gotta sell out our employer
so fuckin easy
so its like
now, none of this would be all that useful, but the person we're working for is a council member, and so is one of the two heads of this mafia family.
but because she got robbed by some fools and her friend got stabbed (but not killed) for dissing the mafia she got team to feel bad for her. now we're on a mission to make sure they don't try to kill her friend again.
and the person we're working for is breaking a lot of those rules
you could call them magic nazis but they're just trying to make sure that the horrible, terribly bad shit that usually happens when people that can use magic exist never happens in the city.
the city has a bunch of council members and a pretty no-nonsense group of magic boys that control everything. the magic boys want to make sure that they A: know about everything that has even the slightest magical influence that goes in and out the city gates, and B: have very strict laws and very real punishments for violating those laws involving magical things
by calling us stupid and saying that we're making dumb decisions acting like we don't have any leverage when we do, provided we shift our perspectives a little.
very aggressively
in a progression system based on story milestones 
so now they’re upset and desperate to get to 3
as the charismatic character and general party face, i spent 3 weeks dicking around, not making any moves. now, 5 sessions in, we’re still level 2 cause team hasn’t finished any jobs. 
i think i’ve convinced my campaign group to join the mafia
so
buh bye
i could see it being appealing to all the kids who were into dubstep and techno in highschool and never quite got out of it.
those kind of fuckwads
specifically the millenials that define themselves as millennials
or
milennials
im just going off tycho and the other stupid avant-garde boxes on there
to be fair im sure the albums don’t say much either
but none of them are beautiful art
and from a design standpoint none of them are bad
but im pretty sure, from the way the guy talks and from the assumption that he actually likes the these, that he’s a graphic designer.
i’d even say the clear one could be defined as such
a lot of them are just regular covers
it’s written by an idiot
the fact that the list starts with tycho definitely loses it points too
but nope
it would have been fine
said interesting instead of beautiful 
if they had just worded the title differently 
that song.
jfc
oh yea
like this one
cursed af
life is pain
nearly sneezed on some dudes food
had to clock out early
bleh
64
oh
shot?
how’d he die?
oh
don’t know them
a cold
idk
and im starting to get sick
lotta work
dying
what the dick is a muckbang
why would anyone make this?
what the fuck?
...
me neither 
and they're cool game mechanics
i went out and researched the bloodlines a bit before this
r e a l l y   well
and their gm roleplays college age guys
seeing a group of not edgy people and the jasper guy roleplaying as a bunch of edgy people
it's fucking funny
and more freeform
rule bound
less
and it seems fun
but theres a stream by the critical role company that's playing it
what the fuck
wow
which is like
im suddenly super interested in vampire: the masquerade
for some reason
anyway
but yea
when regarding religion
it's hard to be accurate
and religion in general
up until there, it's a really interesting take on christianity
everything past the halfway point is bullshit
i think in general
and told me to watch it
my friend charlie from school saw it
yeah pretty accurate for a low budget film
it came out 2007 so
it is
but they made chat logs really hard to copy on new skype
yeah
skype is a high key bitch ass motherfucker
for some reason skype removed you from my favorites list
on break
suh
sadly, i’ve got work today till like midnight 
will do
alright 
oh rip
that thing was a brick
nice
is it still massive like your old comp?
yeah i remember that
nicee
of space?
does your comp actually work?
oh nice?
i haven't
jfc
the new mechanics are easily the coolest thing about the game
you play as hornet
dude
holy shit
this is hollow knight 2
or wait
i didn't realize theres a trailer out for the new hollow knight dlc
holy shit
probably, yeah
cause dosh is a cool ass word
and “dosh” for cash
are anything thats in clockwork orange 
actually the only slang words that should be allowed
and using mood like that should be against said rules
no kids should have strict rules about what the can and cannot say
no the adult was 27 tops
kids meaning people from 15-27
most specific slang words are, but
it’s some postulating ass shit.
2 kids and 1 adult
well
ive ran into like 3 at work
gen z kids are picking it up
nah
i dont like this term
mood
chist
do you know anyone who says “mood” as a term signaling agreement?
cmon
but
i feel like the stupid funny shit on reddit is turning me into a redditfag
the soundtracks one is accurate 
fuck
and 🅱️eter
i was into the coat format for a bit
though
i don’t really know meme formats as much as specific memes
i see
cause tagging things
are they facebook memes?
no
i don’t know what that means tbh
what
wassup big cheese
was walking dogs
im a little late
here comes the money
i made it and i didn’t even realize
holy shit
big fgay
sweet
what have you been up to?
hows everything going with you?
it is
the eyes start weird but you forget about them pretty quick
the animation is also fantastic 
the rest ranges from eh to ass
 thats all thats really good
its the action and the balls
*then
well than fuckin torrent it 
it helps that i’ve never seen alita
about this one
but you’re wrong
 so did i
woulda been more accurate 
is they should have changed the subtitle from battle angle to MURDER KILLER
the one thing i’ll say
the beginning was so ass but i still love this fuckin movie
i can’t say how good this action is cause i don’t want you to be prepared for it
fuck
and then they just show every gory detail
and then they just show every gory detail
w/o breaking suspension of disbelief
but because its robots they can make it fucking balls to the wall insane
they used actual martial arts
did not care
that i just
and so fucking cool
but the action was so fucking good
the story was bad
this shit is fucking sick
he was right
and
critikal convinced me to see alita
whelp
The Higher Power has never been so terrifying 
i found mirror man
shits too strong, needs a nerf
mucho friend points to you
thank you
holyshit this gets better with each reread
fuckin rip im not looking forward to it
and
i’m coming to the realization that im gonna have to draw some fucking maps
even though i definitely am just stealing my favorite concepts from my favorite things and reworking them to suit my needs
campaign building is coming along dankly
yeah
miranda has the trumpet so it doesnt feel long at all
too long with nothing uh standoutish
well yeah its way too long
like that and l’via are my favorites of frances
kinda weird 
its a really good song
i like it a lot now
but the widow is hype
wtf man
now looking at the widow, i always skipped it, cause to me it doesn’t get good until 1:20 with the second chorus where those drums start slapping. that. shit.
sorry, 20 secs
and then the drums start and the tone is set
the drums dont even come in until 10 seconds in but the song is an uncoordinated mess until they start
looking at screenager, now, which i think is the best muse song
definite rip
yuh
so they get a 0/10, sorry, next
their lead and rhythm guitarists are like fucking angels of the shred god sent to earth to rip the shit outta the competition, but their drummer makes me want to shit in my own shoe cause it’d be more fun.
their lead and rhythm guitarists are like fucking angels of the shred god sent to earth to rip the shit outta the competition, but their drummer makes me want to shit in my own shoe cause it’d be more fun.
0/10
those drums? bad. songs? bad.
and they suck bigass sweaty balls
like uh, thank you scientist, super talented musicians save for the singer and the drummer
if they just do standard basic bitch drum beats they can ruin songs
drums
boring drims
or uh
bad drums are the worst
unless they’re bad
drunkship is the best shit ever
its also why fuckin
because jazz can be led by saxophone or trumpet and still be the shit
of course, this doesn’t apply to jazz
and lead guitar is for pussies
in conclusion we need more solid take charge drummers
i thought it was kinda interesting 
and in the songs that are weak baby bitch songs, the rhythm and pacing is set by literally anything else
the rhythm is like set by the drums and the drums lead the rest of the instruments
*shit
where the songs that are fucking balls to the wall awesome and are generally the ahit
and i noticed a pattern with the drums
i like now vs songs that i liked but don’t listen to anymore 
i was lookin at some songs that
oh
happy valentines day my man
by putting him in a full nelson and throwing him just like how in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and  he plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
had to set him straight 
with no headphones in and the sound turned up so goddam loud
and i managed to get in like a half hour of sleep before i woke up with the kid on my bed playing fucking grand theft auto
* niece and nephew 
i was up until fucking 7 am on tuesday babysitting my uh, once-removed nephew, while they spent three hours picking up my cousin from the airport 
and now they’re here
i might be able to do next week, but i forgot my cousins were coming
my schedule on mondays got me waking up throughout the week at like 7:30-8
figured 
what got ya into waking up early?
wednesdays are still best
but understandable 
oof
yeh def
i could send you the doc but just in case you're free for a good portion of the summer im gonna not.
rn im just trying to make a shitton of characters
hopefully its fun
so the players will get imprisoned, freed, then roped into helping the big gang, Skull Kisser's gang, take over the city through judicious appliance of ultra violence.
which happens to be a lot of people in a metropolitan port city in the fantastical middle ages.
and most of that can be attributed to the various gangs that distribute that shit to anyone they can.
aside from that, the city's got a really bad drug problem
so, naturally, going anywhere near her tiny house on the hill is against the law
but she doesn't really do anything unless people come near her
the witch is not chill
The hightower guys are chill and mostly work within the bounds of the laws that the council set them up with.
there are two reasons to be scared of em in the city alone, in the form of the wizards in Hightower, which is a bigass tower in the north corner of the bay, still kinda in the city, and a lone witch who lives on the southern corner of the bay named Selah Selah.
you've got your standard guardsmen and knights and shit, but the city's run by a council, and that council is very very fucking scared of mages
people come there from all over to sell their shit to everyone else. 
the city's like a big trading hub, situated around a bay
and then they'll owe these individuals a shitton of money that they'll have to pay off
and they'll get tossed in jail, and bailed out by the city's scariest gang
and then i'll have the players be framed for a murder or for arson or something
but it'll probably start out as a sandbox
where most things will start
i mean i just have one city in my head rn
it's fucking hype
so far
and
been working on putting together a setting for a dnd campaign.
and im excellent 
absolver is good when you fight good people
he’s gonna grape ya in the mouth
he’s the grapist
hi
people doing stuff bleeeeeh
yeah
is school trying to suffocate you with work?
im dyin
uti where did you go
10/10 still best game
as much shit went wrong with this patch, this is the least laggy it’s ever been
we played 5 games, he beat me the first two then i ran him back and 3-0’d or 3-1’d him for the last 3
Ayyy just woke up and slapped an old jade dorito into the dirt
suh
if its not by early summer than im gonna assume never
for absolver 
and now the game is slow as shit
and slide hopping
they took out wall running
fuckung
the real outrage is apex legends and the fucking battle royale genre destroying everything that was once good
with how things were handed 
i mean the community falling apart was kinda inevitable 
mhm
its less assholish as much as it is super salty and kinda petty
it can be frustrating 
but when devs go radio silent for 3 months after announcing a winter update thatll fix all the bugs, then say nothing until early january, when they say update soon. and then the update comes in february 
a lot of them did come for him cause he’s one of the few vets who kept playing and the only one who tried to keep the community together 
but they ignored him
he tried really hard to champion for the game and really tried to get through to the devs for info over those 5 months
i can relate to him though
made by the devs while they were pretending to work on titanfall 3
which is just a fucking mockery of one of the only truly good fps games out there
and fucking shitty battle royale titanfall
and to add insult to injury they left it for fucking for honor
like yikes
to Shish’s Gaming Discord 
but my boy shishkabob, who ran the premier absolver discord went so far as to change the name from Official Absolver PS4 Server
i mean there are no games like it that can fill its niche, so they’ll come back if its fixed
and pretty much all the veterans have dropped it until next patch
but most of em
no
the problem is the length of time between the patches more than anything else
i think
on accident 
and cant make interesting mixups
cause you just spam jabs at each other
the combat is worse
so even though you cant just jump around 
so now you can get jabbed out of pretty much anything 
but in that patch they reduces stun values for all attacks 
and they just released a patch that fixed it
that was like 5 months ago
it made combat stale and unfun
and even though it was pretty easy to counter 
and a bunch of skrubs relied on it to carry them through fights
that everyone could do
2 updates ago there was a bug with regular dodging
they all moved on to for honor or apex legends
feels bad
i witnessed the death of the absolver community 
today
bruh
where the fuck do you get your bagels?
alright nutty, gotta brb
wo
no headphones 
o.o
skype is a fiend
I bet they do
you gotta light that bitch up like it’s thursday 
wot
is it cold pastrami or warm pastrami?
just with your hands then?
on the bagel?
many bagels?
walking where?
opposite 
now im gonna shower
and
i like just walked my dogs
but uh
yea nah
need to work on that acronym 
hmm
aka: character rolling and child kicking
to crack
addicted
im fuckin
nm
wassup
boi
oi
ye
this past november
but only got into it a few months ago
she started last year
yea
idk its not the most reasonable decision but thats what she did
im completely sure of that
oh they’ll recognize it right away
beat for beat
like
and so people who know her don't immediately recognize that she's using her own life as the basis for her fiction novel
so it doesn't seem too much like her life
she's name swapping it
was distracted
sor 
oh
yeah
and
it's like her life as she imagines it to be, with all biases intact
autobiography is not the right word
with some other elements to make it more fiction-y
a name-swapped autobiography
but it's quite literally
idk if i can legally say
and asking me to help her spruce her shit up
she's writin a book
and working on my mom's stuff
i've just been chilling
i had it off so
twas fine
feels fuckin shitty, man
you're waiting for 2 am?
but having a comp again is good
which means i have cancer
i have new skype
no
ahhh
new skype is the shit one
old skype is the opposite of cancer
wassup w/ you?
not much
hi
what about all your projects and stuff? are they saved somewhere?
which is pretty fun
work and then helping my mom and others edit their stories and shit
mostly
uh work
im fine
tho
cool
ahh feels bad
is it lame hw or game hw?
hw sucks
damn
did he?
lol
wtf lmao
.
ok
uh
who’s this?
uh
wot
how’d you?
still gonna quit that shit though
it was pretty alright 
and not dying cause eric is a pussy
the rest of us spent the whole session playing card and dice games for money or in parsa’s case, antagonizing high level npcs that could kill him in an instant 
from like a mile away
and we did the whole thing with one guy
where you can summon animals
druid spell
it's a
with fucking conjure animals
3 times per day
like
until we killed whoever was in charge
at strongholds

yeah
so i’ll just send you the link
this is best in gif form
will do tho
haven’t checked it
blurry pictures of dogs are the best things ever

piranha plant is so good
DUDE

ultra instinct shaggy?
you never heard of
from the live action movie 
its shaggy
omg
omg
this
it was
and
yea it’s just some glorious bullshit some dude thought would be cool
i forgot about this goldie
and acts like a fuckin teddy bear
she moves like a fuckin ragamuffin
no def not
in order
cleo + friends
bool cleo
normal cleo
cleo when she was the opposite of that
cleo when she was a posh fluffball
yuh
rn
at work
no more
some old
more cleos
also dog
clifford
fuckin
lmao
heres my return meme
same with cool bug facts
DANK 2.0 for sure
that last one is fucking god tier
so you just snipe wolves, goblins, and spiders and obliterate them with your bigass lvl 1 damage in order to get free hp so you can just eat their hits and keep killing them for more hp.
if you've got 20 charisma you get 6 free hp every time you get a kill on an enemy
also playing a level 1 fiend warlock with just hex and a bow is fun as hell
also playing a level 1 fiend warlock with just hex and a bow is fun as hell
you know it's a good first session when you go back to retroactively take notes in character
you know it's a good first session when you go back to retroactively take notes in character
fuck man
zelda i like the sword cause im dogshit with the bow’s motion control 
yeah
idk
cause thats the best one
not ghost game
shit
whats the other vs game
um
i like 1v1s in the metroid one
pikmin isn’t mindblowing
yea
fuckin
fuckin animal crossing
mario chase?
all of them
fucking based
eh
oh co op
doesn’t count 
thats a single player one
because nintendo land has 0 bad games in it
why’s that?
therefore nintendo land is the best videogame 
is nintendo land
and the best party game
best videogames are party games
so idk
cause i didn’t care
after like 5 hours i just lost all motivation to play the game again 
it was way too close
that ruined it for me
i didn’t like the controls or camera
god of war 
and the second one i took the time to actually win gwent cards and i was an unstoppable card master
the witcher was good on the first play through 
hmm
halo was good
nothing else so far
destiny managed to get me
it depends on how they feel
game is shit
bad points now
like make the whole thing leather textured and color it yellow and poop orange
other than that you can customize your ironman suit to look incredibly stupid which is always a plus
you can fall from 3000 feet in the air to whack people with your whacking stick and they fucking explode and all the enemies don’t react cause it’s a triple a game and triple a devs don’t care about that shit
but mostly cause you’re given the tools to make it fun
so far the gameplay loop is fun
brilliant plot
“you’re a dude or a chick who goes out and kills stuff cause you want money
that they can’t fuck up
with a much simpler story 
its just mass effect
actually 
not even half
cause flying
with a lot more verticality 
its a borderlands clone
the selling point was “you can fly”
you’re just some dipshit in an ironman suit
but instead of being the chosen one
destiny 
its
its biowear’s destiny 
cause so far i haven’t found a shooter with anything thats more satisfying than destiny’s revolvers. and destiny is a bad game
if thats the case than it’ll be good
maybe there are guns in there that are as satisfying to shoot as guns in destiny 
its got a good feel to it once i learned the controls
but it’s actually kind of okay
i was expecting to not like this game
what the fuck?
no loss
so it could be real
which is a logical conclusion to the idea
but in the greentext he ended up being banned from gamestop entirely
it was probably fake
and get me my money
i can cancel in like a week
so if it's bad
which currently has a demo running
and i decided to try it out with anthem
a greentext about a guy who eschews banks in favor of doing his banking by pre-ordering games at gamestop then cancelling if they look bad
i saw
yeh
genius
open commerce wasn't taken
OKAY
and the thought struck me that that is a fucking god-tier username
cause i decided to do a little investment banking at gamestop
on ea
im trying to take the name PureCommerce
FUCK
society would crumble without them. yes it would indeed.
periods make things more serious. as if to clarify that i do not joke and am serious about that.
not a one.
nope.
here's a disclaimer, as a newly christened real open person i may just say some degenerate shit about myself and not say whether or not it was a joke and you will just be forced to take it at face value because i never joke anymore.
actually, maybe the in betweens, it could be worth a shot
or the in betweens
or the men
or any of the women
cause i don't like to fuck all the women
but that just aint true
i'd say i don't need a hug cause i'm a strong independent black dude with a GIANT FUCKING DICK and i like to fuck all the women
ty
and
phone died, whoops
cause the writing time is expected and i can just write fast
so starting out in text is nice, got time to formulate thoughts without it being awkward 
also i’m shittier at talking in person anyway 
s’all good
yeh
yeah
there
(noworries)(noworries)(noworries)(noworries)(noworries)(noworries)(noworries)
wait shit
👌👌👌👌
and the fact that you haven’t said anything like that is
platitudes like “it’ll get better” or  whatever are kinda meaningless 
but you’re good at it
a tough situation to say helpful things about 
its also
yeah i knew that
idk
fuck man
like
yeh
because it’s disgusting and the place that it comes from is disgusting
yeah so now i can drop that shit
it makes fucking sense now
but
and that freaked me out
like i had a fucking weird ass incest fetish that i tried very hard and sometimes failed to not  think about
and because it helps me understand things that i didn’t understand about myself
because its better than not having memories 
i feel good
as a whole
i mean
*it
not  q u i t e  ready for if
thatll be a fucking weird conversation 
maybe in a year or two
uh
so that feels good
but nah i’ve got a pretty clear and logical path of event&gt;conclusion to form my biases
for a while i just thought i was some kinda random weirdo or WORSE a fuckin pussy romantic 
it IS kinda cool to finally find a reason as to why im so revolted by normal people and their tendency to just fuck randomly for the sake of getting laid or whatever 
all in all the experience was good enough for now
but left it at that cause we were getting lunch and to go off would have been pretty inappropriate 
when she asked if i was mad at her i gave her a simple yes
hey just flat information 
i’m at a constant low simmer angry, maybe 30-40% at no one in particular 
nothing has changed 
all in all theres a no difference 
but accurate 
thats a weird way to put it
huh
which is very nice of her
she’s gonna try to help me get into a few ayahuasca journeys to see if it helps
lots of im sorry’s and i had no idea’s
but that sorta stuff does
it shouldn’t
she fuckin cried a bit which kinda got on my nerves
i talked to my mom and that was a bit cathartic 
ich
was fantastic 
the guy fuckin cracking up in the end
makes me happy 
a true return to form from the dunk
i know
he’s back
like being able to aim at something without it being center screen is so nice
i really liked the wii controls with free aim, especially for combat
also i wonder how controls will work out
was there a release date for it?
bless
bless
look at that fucker
lmao
what a motherfucking u n i t
mhmmm
its fun cause of the impact of the combat
like the rp
but dnd isn’t fun for the combat tbh
fun shit
used no weapons, so i killed an owlbear by body slamming it and socking it in the face till it dropped 
best 1st session ever 
nah it was fun
thats a milo game for ya
cause i got oneshot
then i died
and ran too
everyone else in the party ran away, so the lizardmen were like okay, fuck it
ran in, punched it in the face
at level 1 got 1st in initiative in a fight against a cr 17 giant worm where we had like 20 lizardmen warriors helping us out
had gorilla strength and could lift bears overhead and break their backs over his knee
dar bearslammer, goliath barbarian, pro wrestler. 
but a similar intelligence level
not an actual ape
it was very fun
i got to play an ape character for one session 
i love it
with a lizard brain
especially when noah is a lizard
discounting hybrid classes
i still think monks are the most based class
sounds like it
fuckin lmao
who was also a bird
you were a dronk monk, right?
idk that seems like a dank meme
in character or out of character?
its fucked
while also being some sweet heroic kid that everybody likes
so he’s basically a master pickup artist 
i fuckin managed to role 20 charisma at level one
rampant asshole party animal by night
and i get to play my split personality warlock, goody two-shoes bitchboy by day
yeh
ran by one of the reddit dudes that joined eric’s game
online
yea lul
finish school already so we can play some dnd
fukin
yea
shit looks like it’ll be miles better than eric’s game
but n e way
me, i just like playing evil characters and trying not to get caught 
but i think there are a lot of factors involved in making the game enjoyable so it’s hard to get into until it clicks
me neither tbh
but characters have now all been made
and keep shit interesting without attention hogging 
BUT he knows how to play a character 
yea cause he’s a gigantic fuckwad
who is a surprisingly fun dude to hang with when it involves dnd
or really anyone we know save for parsa
recently, I joined another dnd group that doesn’t involve eric
walking doggos
im good
11/10
yeah
is the best
this thing
and then the second half is all, “bush did 9/11” “jet fuel can’t melt steel beams”
the first half is about astrology, religion, and history 
but only the second half
yeah
hmm
btw
zeitgeist 
a fuckin doozy
that ones
aight
you just actually don’t have time
ah i c
and then it’s worth attempting to get other people to read it when you’re hooked
when you’re alone
im saying it’s worth taking the year and only reading it when on the subway or waiting between classes
oh im not saying you should devote time to it
you could maybe catch up in 3 months
in which case
unless you devote all of your time to it
cause it’ll take you like a year to catch up
you wouldn’t have to care about that
but
usually on wednesdays and saturdays
3 times on rare occasions 
2-3 times a week
but fuck that shit i held off long enough, this shits too good
i figured i’d hold off
but with it being so long
i think i brought it up once
still good though
yeah
body horror on like 13 year olds
oh the body horror was fine
i rate 9/10 cause he pushed it too far
but it was pretty much, body horror: the novel, with a good bit of child abuse sprinkled all over the place
not quite DANK 2.0
is also turbo dank
the second of the two other serials
im dumb
oh no, finished in 2013
finished it in 2015
actually now that i think about it, worm was 2011
between worm and it’s sequel he made two other books
it is
i love it
is fucked up
the guy who came up with this shit
yep
best shit ever
and then those insects search out people, then enter through their orifices and i think explode on command if i remember correctly 
a character called breed who shows up way later carries around a bunch of nasty human-cockroach larva in his stomach and can vomit them up
like uh
but it gets gory cause other people are fucked and they can do scary shit
well not too gory
and the tactics she uses to fight are smart, efficient and kinda ruthless when she needs them to be
in worm it’s the fact that the protagonist’s power is the ability to manipulate swarms of bugs.
uh
yeah
and because it’s realistic and fuckef up its got the best superhero fights ever written imo. and that includes movies and comics
but he figures it out
so its a little cringey
cause worm is the guy’s first thing he put out
rough 
are like
the first 3 or so chapters
and very fucked up
and makes everything very realistic 
it takes the idea
uh
cause most web shit involving storytelling is comics
serial novel
not a comic
no art
i only started reading it in 2016
maybe 2013? actually 
since like 2012
and pick up whenever you’re waiting for something 
so you can just have a tab on your phones browser just dedicated to it
that are each a webpage 
is that it’s written in chapter pieces
best thing about it
yep
DANK 2.0
.
well dank 2.0 then
it’s really fucking good.
DANK 4.0
but yea im reading the update
the first is called worm and the second which i think might be better is called ward
and b, i get a lot of ideas for oxium powers that are loosely based on powers from it
its a, incredibly fucking long
cause
im not gonna recommend it to you
superhero deconstruction webserial that happens to be my current favorite thing im reading just got updated 
the uh
well
uhh
mice
wassup
skype you dick fuck
oh
: ?
: ?
Night
g'night
im gonna sleep
now
alright
ye
im over it
*that
dw bout tha
it's a wild ride, but now you've got shotgun
yea ofc
thanks
out
ollie
i'll take you up on that offer
aight
this time if i don't respond it's safe to assume i'm conked out
im falling asleep at my keyboard
okay
just the basic facts
no how, or why or anything
i don't have a comprehensive enough memory to know more than this happened
that is just wild speculation
i mean
and i wonder if this might be why
mostly because things rarely piss me off as much as i get pissed watching people use others for petty shit like money
i don't know how i feel about that
it was maybe some of the money from my great grandmother passing away, as well as money from my dad and other guys
it wasn't my grandparents
so i start to wonder who were my mom and i benefitting off of at that point
but it's not the sort of thing that she should have been able to do at that time, at least based off how she's explained her work life to me
going to greece and mexico with you was insane
i can't be upset with her for that
and
by doing, for me the things that she at that point wished someone would do for her. greece, mexico, equador, etc.
so she tried to show that she does
she learned at least that she was supposed to care
she has her good points
fucking christ
yeah
but essentially that
with kinder words yeah
because she says it.
and i know this
just because she wanted to say they've gotten better
and she still threw me to them
because she knew her family was fucked up
well it all involves her
and
i will
yeah
but she can't make it up right now.
i mean she can
it wouldn't be a resolution to the problem
to accept a realization and an apology as enough
enough
but i don't think that in the moment i'd care.
she could
because that's where that conversation ends at this point.
but the act of talking to her is the ruthless cutting her out
yeah
but that's most of what i've remembered
not necessarily it
that's
aside from ruthlessly cut her out of my life and maybe try to pick up the pieces at a later date
regarding my mom, i don't know what i can do
i don't know
because that's what it takes in order to have a mostly peaceful relationship with her.
and i pretend i'm not pissed at that.
then, "i'm moving to san francisco, bye"
and then that turned into, "go spend the year with your dad."
and at the end of that year, my mom said, alright fuck you mars i'm going to hawaii, go spend the summer with your dad.
for a year
and then in high school that every other weekend became, whichever weekends i wanted, so the four days dropped to two days and then no days
but yeah
it was the court case that my mom won
well
yep
which is actually nothing
so 4 days a month
it was every other weekend
and actually
but that boils down to 8 days a month
yeah
*entire year in my room unless i was at school or working directly after school.
give or take like 2 days
and maybe my last year of high school, but by that point i was so fucked i spent the entire year in my room
and i don't remember that shit i was a toddler
to really interact with me, beyond the first three years of my life
my dad never once got the opportunity
yeah
i mean
well that's good.
oh i see
and artists do crazy shit sometimes
and your dad is an artist
yeah
yeah exactly
for about 4 or 5 years
so i've been sitting in a developmental with that sorta shit stuck in the back of my head
yeah
and that, to me, freaks me the fuck out.
the only memories i really have regarding her back in those days, are just stories that she's told me over and over again
because i don't trust my own memories of her
mostly stuff regarding my mom
no there is
yep
i cant be for sure because i don't remember everything.
idk.
but.
and more
those cousins
and instead save money so we could go on trips like to boston to visit family
i/e fuck them and let them live with us sometimes so she wouldn't have to pay for basic shit like food and rent
and she's basically used all of them as financial buffers
she's had a bunch since then
where she met jesse vaughn, who was my mom's first boyfriend after my dad
and started her spiritual journey stuff at the self realization fellowship in LA
started painting
mhm
she wrote the i hate you book about my dad
yeah
after that my mom had a short relationship with my godmother
make them seperate
in order to do that
and i think she may have told her that he was
was one of those lesbians
my godmother julisa
and my mom assumed he was fucking them
because he did a photoshoot for a bunch of lesbians in the desert
and he was essentially kicked out
and he told me his side of the story of why he left
21st birthday was when i got to talk to my dad for a couple hours
yesterday
but i didn't remember all this until like
21st birthday was the start
and just forced it out. hard reset.
and couldn't handle it
*things
i think my 12-13 year old mind started understanding thingx
it was like 90% repressed yeah
in answer to the earlier questions
thank you man i just read all that it means a fucking lot
also
transfer to comp complete
so
ok
i  wow oof
gimme a sec
finally got home
at 15%
my phone started shutting itself off likr an asshole
oh shit youre still onlinr
uh
and who doesn’t need vetting
so i don’t trust him like i do you who i’ve talked to for a good 90% of my life
but i haven’t vetted jonah
outside of immediate family
maybe jonah
i probably won’t tell anyone else
uh
yeah
this is about as real as i can be
uh
people like my mom lie about this
i’d rather die than lie about something as important 
i wouldn’t lie about this
yeah i’vr been in contact with some fucked up people
he’s only come to my house three times outside of birthdays
*house
yeah at his housr
“house” and “doctor”
ah
we met in second grade and he introduced me to porn in 3rd after a year of playing house and doctor and shit
by that point i’d already been fuckin doing sex shit with marko for a year
what else
uh
i found her on facebook a few months ago and i’m terrified to contact her because there’s no way she hasn’t changed from the person she used to be.
and not just her leaving 
but it was something that had several sources 
i don’t know what happened to make me feel like that
and since then i’ve wanted to kill myself
i don’t remember her. but it felt like i met my soulmate and got to connect with het for a single inconsequential year that i only remember two sparce glimpses of
her name was sophia. you and my mom are now the only people who have heard of her.
* and i haven’t felt anything for anyone since
and then she moved to oregon since.
i fell in love with someone. thouroughly, with every fiber of my fuckin being
or maybe fourth grade
at some point around end of third grade or so
yes
and now
mostly sexually also in general 
long time.
long
for a long
i’ve let various aunts, those cousins, another male cousin, che, marko, several people throughout school and family friends use me to do whatever they want
but for example 
there isn’t a difference when you’re just allowing yourself to be used
uh other person/thing
the
no
wow repeated myself
because it doesn’t matter to me to that degree
if i had to call myself anything i’d probably be pansexual
maybe 17
until the last time i saw them
i think if i had to say i was anything, i’d say i am pansexual, because it doesn’t matter to me to that degree
so assuming i take responsibility for my actions. I’ve willingly allowed myself to be raped by people who i myself am not attracted to. and i’ve done it many. many times.
but i was a little kid who knew nothing and was just happy to play with them and make them happy
now im not attracted to them nor have i ever been
we’d play sex games in their attic or the bathtub when i visited them in boston. me at 7 them at 10
at that point it was with my cousins Kiah and kiara, who are twins and both 3 years older than me
i think i’ve been sexually active since i was about 7. 
and none of it is happy
i’ve remembered a lot since then
so last few times we left off, we’ve talked about how i dont remember the majority of my life and it’s fucked me way up. but i’m starting to remember things now
okok
means maybe i can sleep at a half descent hour 
but COOL
i’ve gotta be high until then i guess
well he was asleep, thought that might happen so we pushed it to tmrw
ty
yeah
thank you.
but rn is it okay if i ask you to hold on for up to an hour and a half?
i’ll wait till friday for my mom
no i’m to intimidated to call my dad when im sober
call my dad?
shit
and
actually i’ve gotta do that right now.
im 
*dad
friday i’m gonna have a long talk with my mom and tonight i’m gonna call my das
wanna have a real open conversation with a dude who’s just made a commitment to be 100% real and open with the entire world?
it’s 12:25
okay
and that there is the most cocky thing i’ve ever said
you’ll be the first ROP after me
Which implies yes
for sure
cause then I’ll know that i didn’t fuck up
you might be the first ROP out there
that at some point
i hope
exactly 
but
yeah ofc
yeah its nuts
I fuckin love you Uti, you’re my best friend i’ll ever have
so i don’t have to say it later
as souls i want to say this now
so
when i die, there is no way in fucking hell that i’m coming back to this fucking shithole of an existence
thats what i was trying to get to
i am not coming back here.
but as a person who believes in that kooky shit
and yea its impossible to know
like that
philosophy will fuck you up
and evolve and shit
to test out methods
that starts in the same direction, but with different starting conditions 
and most souls just start another life
but thats only a small number that deserve that promotion 
idk about heavens or hells, but i think there are probably other places your soul can move to when you die
i think a soul is just energy with a direction and our lives are just a field where that direction can be refined by rolling around and bouncing on other souls with other directions . this is a very vague and complex metaphor.
i think a soul is just energy with a direction and our lives are just a field where that direction can be refined by rolling around and bouncing on other souls with other directions . this is a very vague and complex metaphor.
I did not think so
yea
so
which isn’t good enough 
because if you don’t then living is pretty much meaningless outside of like, having fun
but i do believe in souls
personally i don’t believe in a god
if you believed in god or souls or anything 
i asked you a bit ago i think
i hate that problem 
i guess
its a problem with humanity 
well yeah
but thats the case in our society 
or india
maybe not in say africa 
everyone puts on an act when they’re with others
nope
Real, Open People
and that is what’s wrong with society 
ROPs dont exist 
w’e placeholder will be ROPs
the openers sounds gross
cause
im trying to think of a catchy word for real, open people that don’t put on faces
it’s the
and im sick of it
and theres a certain type of person that has been losing for a while
cause getting ahead in life is about winning the information war
i’ll tell you why
wow why tf am i breaking down the state of california by the vibes of it’s districts
hmm
pasadena does though 
downtown don’t have that
which is intended, they have a separate city council 
yeh
and new ideas are the strongest form of income these days
an idea warzone
LA is
cause LA is fucking crazy
i think santa monica is for people who won something and wanted to escape LA
but all the sections of every city has a vibe that generally matches the people that live there
cause its it’s own area
santa monica i cant say really
all the artists and shit
yeh, thats what the silverlake staging ground is more or less
if you’re not there are not many other reasons to go there other than to interact with those types and try to get in there
or musician
its a good place if you’re a budding visual artist 
anyway its fun to see
hmm
money or attractive jobs
and the guys just have money and that’s really it
and/or artists musicians and actors
rn most of the guys are nervous af cause it’s silverlake and the girls here are practiced 
i mean
cause they know that they’re gonna fuck someone later
yeah ofc
and noting all the games they’re playing and faces they’re putting on.
im just sitting here watching people hook up with strangers at my dad’s bar
anyway
cause downers make me pass out immediately 
so much more
but i like uppers like
ye
indica is the mellow one.
makes you shiver
sativa is the upper
in a very active brain state
it was probably sativa so i’m
and now
like aged 8 years shit. So one puff later I’m high as a bird
and it was some of his good shit
my dad came over as i was finishing my shift and we smoked some of his weed and hung out for a bit.
and i was right.
on friday 
*like
so i had a feeling that today would fuck me up likr
work
sor had to run to worj
uh
i found it cause
ah cool
i meant tha album
*that?
whered you find thar
i was yea
ah ic
i gotta work tmrw night
tomorrow as in tues?
wednesday is the better day anyway 
aight
unless i’m drunk enough and you’re playing a particular couple songs at max volume 
and no you won’t get to see what the techno-snake hands are
but shit if status didn’t make me break out the techno snake hands
and is more edm
its different from edgecuck the album
the ugly art is also good
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCKJKKJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
*it
also i forgot, i can do today if you’re with jt
nah a four is a respectable score
i was thinking more of a -3/10
i was thinking more of a -3/10
and yea 2/10 is pretty high for that roast
what u waiting for then?
o
maybe 
but i was just completely unprepared and it felt like rubbing my brain on sandpaper
that said it might not be the case for you
p
like the only reason i did was cause i didn’t have any connection for like 4 days and it happened to be saved on my phone
the problem is that the first listen is so bad that you end up saying “fuck you machine girl you’re an edgy cuck bitch i’ll never listen to this again” and then you don’t listen to it again.
but its done well
and it is
it sounds like stupid angsty edgelord shit
cause at first
tbh it takes a hot minute to warm up to
at all
its not wlfgrl
but
its dank
ah ye
reggae
well yea but it’s closer to dubstep than it is to say
or better yet, if dubstep was some crazy shit that had no potential to make any money ever
its like what could have happened if dubstep was actually good and the creators of the generes weren’t gigantic cuck fuckbois and instead we’re actually as batshit crazy as they pretended they were
lmao
after listening to because i’m young, arrogant, and hate everything you stand for three times, I can conclude that new machine girl is completely taking himself seriously, but it doesn’t actually matter, because the songs are fucking amped as shit and i love it
after listening to because i’m young, arrogant, and hate everything you stand for three times, I can conclude that new machine girl is completely taking himself seriously, but it doesn’t actually matter, because the songs are fucking amped as shit and i love it
alright
lol
if their old stuff is bad, their new stuff is a dumpster fire in a pigpen
its true
eh
but now im like
i used to be super into a few coldplay songs
with one fuckin YUH
mc rides would punch coldplay the fuck out
coldplay’s fuckin lame
cause it made me realize 
coldplay
you know what was a weird ass nostalgia dive?
i didn’t do that one, tbh so I can’t say for sure but it probably woulda been similar
yea
and im not ready to go back to linkin park yet
and muse came after linkin park
cause nostalgia tours can be a good time
but i was been listening to em pretty recently
muse is old news my mang
just cause that song is scary af
in terms of best composed song tho, It’d still have to be screenager though
Tbh i dont know what that means so
but, yeah. Blackout is best cause i can identify with the song on a life-theory level.
yuh
i mean i didn’t do it as much past like 16, but it was definitely a thing that sometimes happened up until like 18
a whole fuckin lot
but at the time i liked the one song a lot
and it made the old songs completely unbearable to listen to for a good year or two
i’d do one song like 300-400 times then be over it and move on
i was a weird ass kid
over and over again
i really just listened to one song at a time
same
the don’t kid yourself one
its the slow ass one that you (as in everyone) always skip when listening to absolution
que
wowee look at that it was just 40 mins
in like an hour
see ya
and now my battery is dead, rip
the whole fuckin message is: Figure out what matters and care cause you don’t have time to not.
it’s so deep there is no bottom
has meaning at literally any stage of life
blackout 
that song
:P
and if you don’t agree with me fuck you
muse’s best song is blackout 
fuck glorious 
fuck take a bow
fuck screenager
imma go ahead and say it
no
wot
.
playing what?
playing off?
nice
hows ur new level?
but whats been up with you?
help
help
plz
and im dyin man
also i woke up late and didn’t eat all day
 8 1/2 if you count break
8 hrs
holy shit im finally off work
and then thurs and fri
ready player one is crapola
uhhh wednesday 
oh my god
but seeing that shit now?
so in my imagination the animation was and still kinda is very good
and i haven’t watched it since then
when it came out i thought it was good
it shouldn’t exist in any universe. but it does
it truly is
steve buchemi, sylvester stallone, elijah wood, george clooney, fucking danny trejo, and selena gomez
and is also a reminder that spy kids 3 was the true biggest crossover event in movie history
this video reminds me of when youtube had quality content
aight then
lol
idk what's going on there
the audio can use some work
the video is perfect
later
wtf
oh
when's your flight btw?
but at least we're all fucked together
we're all absolutely fucked
playing those shit-tier hentai games was the hallmark of our formative years
ofc
i thought you were there for fantasy, though, you weren't?
they were good times
im just bustin your chops
bvruh
yes
you paid for dungeon
you paid for them tho
david's the one with fantasy and swim club
oh, good
does having sakura fantasy and sakura dungeon in your steam library make you cool
fuckin weeb
i know
ah
not like i have any porn on it
i'd share my library
oh
which includes dark soul
he'd get a bunch of random crap that i got off a humble bundle
maybe
oh
my games i want list has a hefty line
since
idk if i'll play it for anything more than free rn tho
I think I will
lol
What's your name?
its the one where you look back in time to solve the ghost ship mystery, right?
no but you did tell me about it
that's some shit you don't see every day
wow
l m a o
they're nutty
fuckin blue lobsters
i don’t know.
cause it means you stumble on shit like this
is good
and that there are thousands of them
but the fact that reddit doesn’t advertise its communities
the karma system and shit is bad
and i like reddit cause their subreddit system is so good
i was thinking about it
so
kmb
gknight
esp since we’ll be starting at 11:30 your time
yeh for sure
we start in 15
do whatever getting ready you gotta do rn
so
also i gotta walk el doggios before i start
sor man im a little later than i said i’d be
k
k
30 mins to an hour late
im gonna be late
wed thurs is good
cause i won't be home until at least after 10
tuesday won't happen
so like 9-10 for you
cause i gotta stop and get dog food
but i won't be back until 6 or 7
tomorrow i get off at 3:30- 4
like
so when do we finish this com?
alright
eggcellent
or look stupid
so by then i was either had to commit
i only realized it after i sent the first message
nah it was my phone lmao
START OVER
DESTROY ALL EVIDENCE,
WE GOTTA PUSH THE EMERGENCY BUTTON
FUCK
N
EVERYBODY GET DOW
WE HAVE A LEAK
who the fuck is anonymous llama?
oi
and lemme know if you think my kisket buff is too heavy
can you do me a favor and check fucking shit?
o i
just goes to show that capitalism is why we can’t have nice things
everyone must have dropped it.
dam did you see that the regular movie pass plan is 6.95
yuh
thats the i’ve seen enough i’m going the fuck to bed video 
that shit nast
cause jesus 
and i probably wont
i didn’t 
he’s addressing them, u see
no he’s trying to fuck a videogame lover
at least say eat ass
pussy ass bitch
and you can tell cause he doesn’t even describe what to do
he’s a fuckboi
and it made me want to die
but i did listen to the first 10 seconds
i could not finish the second one
yuh
yup
&lt;3
pumba
to miami?
damn
have you seen this shit
goddamn
there were others that i think might fit the bill but im lookin
hmm
lijar is spanish tho
and bokbocegi lijar which has bokbocegi for dung beetle and lijar for sand
oroumczek
makes me fuckin wonder man
im noticing you used a lot of turkish for your names
dam right
to keep staying up
im a little too sick i think
yo
better get on that my guy
uh, yikes
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy nice
oof
well there we go
fuck it, right?
or tmrw and thurs night
btw
i can do tomorrow or thurs night not fri or sat
yuh
ie: big fuckboi
didn’t look like him, but kinda acted like tracy might have acted
who went by tracy
i did end up meeting a dude named alex tracy, tho
i still gotta get home
it was a late fukin night
dank boye
Yeah it is
oh l m a o
thats it
no she just doesn’t pay attention 
and its like. what the fuck?
she told her friend who was over about how she’s been sick with some sinus shit, and now im sick with some sinus shit
then two seconds after i took the bite
with her fork
and offered me a bite
she had some mexican food like 3 days ago that she thought was good
and i know the exact moment 
and i know the exact moment 
my aunt got me sick
after work im down
but sometimes its just clearly a fake ass name
and usually the names seem like they’re previous residents or something 
and usually the names seem like they’re previous residents or something 
but my house gets a lot of mail for random ass people
i don’t think i’ve told you
so
then, this morning, pink decided to get frisky with navy’s leftovers, but at the sight of my bigmassive submarine body, he decided to reconsider, and we came to an agreement where he gets two outposts and then fucks off forever.
so over the course of last night, a few things happened, navy blue accepted defeat at the hands of me and my new ally brown. he sent me a letter of resignation that was very heartfelt and depressing.
bullshit
thatd be
def
yeah thats fair
how long do you have to finish the level?
sounds gucci
yuh
it could just be a big asshole in the way
*enough
fair nough
how would you kill the vine enemy?
also thats fucking dank
sounds good
and you can only kill him by impaling between the cheeks
who’s head is an ass
maybe bill
you’ll need a new meme boss for the end
yea makes sense
hmm
also nothing aside from subterfuge
or maybe, is it possible to throw the sword as you’re jumping to it?
could he frustrating though, if players are bad
esp if they do that big big damage
if theres a lotta projectiles then it could be about dodging em while you clear
would be ultra dank
oh cool
burn?
oof
anyway man, wassup w/ you?
that shit addictive 
having free reign to be a complete and utter bastard to 8-10 people anonymously over the course of a week or so kinda gets to your head
while you’re still free tho. cause
idk if you’ve played any games solo, but if you haven’t, js you should try
if it didn’t have a chat the game would be complete dogshit
but for me it’s much more fun to be the asshole trying to play off all the sides
and you can win easily just by teaming up with one guy, getting good specialists and steamrolling.
in the game
i mean there are tons of strats that work
cause friends change the dynamic a ton
instead of playing with friends 
its better as a solo game i think
way too fun
got the brown dude on the side helping me kill the navy guy between us while i feed everyone else info about their enemies.
fucking allied with three people who are all trying to kill each other
im less than a day in and i’ve already pitted everyone in the game against one another 
it’s gotta be in there
now that im in a game of subterfuge 
cause
of top 10 bideogames
*now
i’ve got to edit my list noe
eta like 30 mins tops
?
yes i am
i’ll be there between 2:30 and 3 i think
just gotta get the dogs walked and fed first
that i come back afterward and then stay the night
but theres a chance
i probably gotta go back
yuh
thats cool
didn’t know julia was a borderlands fan tho
yuh
what you up to tonight man?
No they were not
all those days r good
ok
naturally 
it’s important to not that this is all theater of the mind, and not actual things that have been planned for long periods of time
hypothetically speaking, of course 
this is all based on the fact that for now LW can only see that vica just wants war for war’s sake
or if she has one
i don’t know vica’s endgame
cause 
i won’t 
same
i mean
o
probably won’t end up kidnapping as much as bribing
anyway coo
eks dee
cant punch steam, wat do?
but agean vapor is just steam
and thats not hypothetical 
im gonna kill agean vapor first
before any alleged hypothetical events take place
i def wanted to ask this hypothetical question
i know you plan to use em which is why
aight
im worried about team 1
tbh
then itll be kind of important 
until s13 comes by
at least
same
yea i figured 
this is just an idea i had a few days ago that i figured would make s13 a bit more hectic 
that said you can say no
lady wolf only plays in absolutes
hypothetically, of course 
i mean kill whatever lords you don’t need and replace them with my own and then attack you with everyone when you have nobody left to save you and everyone wants you replaced
and by sabotage
hypothetically 
yes
oh i assumed that
vica’s cool
cause
yea but i wouldn’t assassinate the leader of the horror squad even in a theoretical situation 
it would, in this theoretical, hypothetical situation, have to go through all the official channels, though, right?
*of
and probably the permission pf the agean vapor
ofc not, in this hypothetical situation she’d need at least 2/3 of the lords backing her
but remember this is 100% hypothetical 
i get it
odd question 
hypothetically of course 
but how far could i hypothetically go, should lady wolf hypothetically try to turn the pirates against vica
cause all the important bits are there
well i suppose you already could piece it together if you tried
hnm
it’s 
well
rather than vica herself 
attack vica’s resources, i guess
or
or blow up most of your ships
kill half your pirate lords
lets say i were to
hmm
not for this season but like next season on
and making things hard for her in general 
in terms of hampering her
status wise i guess
like uhhh
no
in rp
how hard can i hit vica
rq
i wanted to ask
oh
y u p
just gotta add emotes to online
lots of troll potential 
smash is good game
with the bandana and shit
i like green cause its edgelord cancer
Are you available now?
hipster one is omega cancer
or light blue
which is green
also only use the most cancer inkling skin
and use the high energy emote at the start of every match
i changed my name to im scum

i
i have that shit
ye

if you watch it right away you also make me look like an asshole
watch that fuckin shit
gotta

its not swans, cause
well its dope
ah
her solo shit is awesome
i love jarboe

that’d be dope
(smile)
mhm
so indie games just get funded cause those guys aren’t afraid of anything 
exists
and also devolver digital
ye u got indie game studios
pixel art’s fuckin hard, man
but ye
not hand drawn
hollow knight was drawn
i don’t know what im talking about
actually 
superhot
with like
away from pixel art to more cell shading
yea
:0
considering how much people are hating the big companies 
just sayin i think its gonna be a good year for indie game devs
got any schemes for 2019?
happy actual new year
ay
n i c e
hows yr party goin?
mhm
it is an excellent subversion of expectations
that curious george one is a 10
happy new year mang
aight
all that it would really prove is that qitara is a lot more in the loop than most.
but its not the most necessary thing ever.
there are a few things with qitara and iri that happened behind the scenes, a while ago, that i could do in a prologue if you wanted to at some point.
when she was meeting the team, and they became friends because qitara is a freak
iri - 1 or 2
actually im pretty sure it started in iri
qitara-iri missions have been an assumed thing since a while back
you're right that they aren't chasing veruvi for the orb, since she joined em
there are a few things that didn't come across very well.
part one of an entire lifetime
the maw's got some issues 
i call this one
and it's done
here we go
Alright
pretty much all of that
i can answer
ty
shweet
that's cause they weren't mentioned before
*point
but tell me so i can clarify for you cause that's the whole poing
both
well
tell me
yeah
skype is rarted
I am intrigued
which made me think of it
im currently working on another
nah
lmso
depending on whether or not i explain em well enough in the next prog
there are some details that might need explaining
did you ever read the newest prologue i sent?
oh
yep
most likely i just sprained the ankle
rn it only hurts if i walk on it
ty for the advice
super unfortunate 
just
yea
and will see tomorrow 
im icing it for tonight 
i don’t think so
don’t think im going anywhere for new years eve
i
and my foot is really killing me
i got hit by a car while walking my dogs today
so
yeah definitely 
what the fuck
no
check this shit out
nice
nice

Sidney Royel Selby III
Tacitus K Dichs. The man who risked it all. RIP 1942-2020
honorable death through the removement of the bowels from the body
because my internet is committing seppuku
it[s
oh
:/
Are you available now?
im ready early if you're ready\
9:30-10
like
u gonna be down to arr pee
oi
my back’s cramped like a motherfuker
man that one is all too real
me lad
boy
merry chimbus my bou
OI
How was it?
i’ve got like 3 prologues to write right now
its fine
will do
big dong
yea
tues hopefully 
hmm
need tp get on a plane at 3 and haven’t packed anything 
i gotta set an alarm 
yuh
yea
cause twin peaks exists 
it’s tough 
yea
i mean ofc
rly
it
cause my mom was into if
a while back
yuh
love that shit
inland empire is nutso
but im drunk af so im askin
which is A LOT to fuckin ask
i want it to not answer those questions at all, have betty disappear, and have rita go through the anguish of regaining her fucked up memory, without showing what those memories are
sort of
which is what the current ending does
appeasing people is answering the why and how questions 
yea but no
id rather that the last third was a continuation of the narrative from the first 2/3’s
except 
yea
i just feel like the ending was written in order to appease people rather than to finish the story 
its a fantastic movie regardless 
but other than that it’s a fantastic movie
which i don’t think was really pertinent to the story 
and it flashed back to diane and recounted her decisions and why she hired a hitman to kill rita/camilla
and betty aint
cause diane selwyn is a real person
nah its a flashback
but we never saw that
as much as i did about what would happen after the box was  opened.
cause tbh i really didn’t care at that point, why everything happened or about any explanations
where it swapped to a flashback 
up until like the last 15 mins
mulholland drive was good
im good
that is an excuse tjo
so whenever i come back to it im rusty 
i play it on and off
nah
even i couldn’t get over that
thats a tough one
oof
hey man
and
getting over wat
good movie
silencio
and then boom
 THIS TURNED INTO A VERY DIFFERENT MOVIE THAN I HAD ORIGINALLY EXPECTED 
i figured that much
the fuckin cowboy, huh?
huh????????
.
“one more time if you do good, two more times if you do bad,” huh????
nobody else could play that role
at all
starring in the most nick cage action movie ever written 
nick cage
it’s basically 
fucking hilarious
chainsaw fight
the uh
also
though
the fucking biker gang design was so fuckin cool
that made me go from 0 to 200.
but that fucking scream, man.
straight written by a dude who was high on peyote
the movie was so fuckin weird, and the lines were like
0% invested until the vodka scene
i was like
which magnificent retard let this movie get made?
who said yes to this
what the fuck.
nick cage just snapped a dude's neck and snorted a pile of cocaine off a shard of glass
this is the most metal movie ever made
holy fucking shit
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING?
THE SHITROLLING FUCK?
WHAT
IS AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE?
THE TITLECARD FOR FUCKING MANDY
yuh
skype is a fool
skype needs to get with the times
What does that mean?
cause i read that as northwest
i must be   b o o l i n g rn
woah
v fishy
yea
sor got hard hassled for a bit there
skypes rly dickriding you man
Thank you so much
which is insane 
and it only takes like 20 mins
you can actually go places in new york
understandable, la is a crapheap covered in glam and sparkles to make it enticing 
how do you like the city btw?
im sure a lotta people are in their element there
at least for me
no space
new york’s too crowded for that
it’ll be a good time hopefully im there
and instead just wanna find a place to think at 200 miles a minute 
and really don’t have anything important to do at all
when you have a good week off
i’d say 2 tries is good, but i’d be lying. cause shrooms are the best
once aint enough tho
yea
the experience is completely different, of course 
you can pay 35 bucks for a nice 30 ounce bottle of vodka which will last you five or 6 nights or you and 2 friends 1 good night
typical dose is 3.5 grams, which at the generous discount we received was 35 bucks
only problem with shrooms is they’re expensive as all fuck
im not an advocate of mixing your intoxicants
not with anything else
just
you should
very clean
incredible work
from jett
*them
*then
and he sourced then
shrooms aren’t cheap what he had to do was source them
but yup
well no
yup
will do
everything will be good
tmrw im gonna do some shrooms with milo
w/e tho
big rip man
is the everyone in question 
me
well one person fucked up and everyone has to deal with it
so everyone fucked up
mhm
you can’t really buy tickets at all then
but you can’t buy cheap tickets 2 weeks before christmas 
the message is just out on the app to everyone
for instance my mom buys the tickets one day, so i put in the request for the days off. next week get a message saying, “remember, just because you put in a request doesn’t mean we’re accepting it, so don’t make any concrete plans.” 

3 weeks later i get a text from manager Jo saying i need you to work christmas eve morning, so i can’t do the full time off request.  then two weeks after that i get scheduled to work christmas eve at 5:30 pm

not bad as much as way too salty management 
bad management being the main issue 
*guess
which is the issue i have there, i want good. not just ok or fine. too many factors in the way though, i guesd
it counts as okay, doesnt count as good
anywhere else i wouldn’t have a job when i got back from wyoming 
it’ll only be fine cause my dad’s the owner
or i try to get my guy momo to switch shifts and take an uber from my job to the airport at like 1 so i can have a chance 
i’ve just gotta tell my job that i can’t make it on monday and take whatever hit comes from that
but w/e
im exaggerating 
ofc
not THAT dark
ehhhh
and i realize i’ve been an asshole to my dad for 20 years for no reason and all he really wants is to spend a little time with his family before he drops
and my aunt is driving me fuckin nuts
especially this christmas eve when im starting to remember how much my mom fucked me up as a kid
especially on christmas eve where time gets contested.
its just the small pain in the ass that im not sure if i can handle right now
its not that its a massive pain in the ass
yeah
its like colarado or utah in that regard
technically 
jackson hole is a ski village 
yea
which is ridiculous, but not something i can argue against without being a massive cock fuck asshole 
in order to say that i wasn’t giving her enough time or something 
but she leveraged the fact that i was spending thanksgiving with my dad
i wouldn’t have gone tbh
yea
with a few of her friend/clients 
my mom begged me for four days back last month to spend christmas with her in jackson hole, wyoming 
yep
cause i gotta buy christmas gifts and im scheduled to work when im supposed to be on an airplane and nobody can cover my shift
not
except 
same
nice
so what you up to?
tis v good
cause the animation is 10/10
but its so good

im not toxic 
but im actually laughing at baha

you have to be 25 to rent a car
lol
or at least partially cover them
if she can cover cleo and buddy then im fine
habent had a chance to ask my aunt

same goes for like ghost in the shell
cause eva isn't like anime
but liking eva isn't weeby at all
ok
just my general thoughts on what i've heard about the thing
firsthand information
that said this isn't like
gateway edgy
or like
it can be kinda edgy though
memey i guess.
a jett kind of weeb
it's like
fairy tale is like

he's slowly turning into a weeb
idk what to say bout that
and

milo
falco
wow
of villager
i thought she was an echo fighter
wait wtf
or play it
i'll have to get smash ultimate to see
she's not killager
but

cause im worried im not gonna like it as much as i like absolver

got smash ultimate?
ye
i'll watch mulholland drive tomorrow and mandy on tuesday so you'll have to watch it
sunday after next

well
oof

understandable
like
yeah
and how a bunch of ancient stories are similar if not the same
about how the bible is very closely related to astrology
mostly a political and religious documentary

2007
hmm
it's crazy
ok
the movie

omg im dyin
why are you capitalizing seething 
stahp
omg
so i can laugh 
i nrrf to go ro the vathroom
holyshirin
what the fuck
absolver is closer to guitar hero than it is to dark souls
is part of whats killing it
to describe the game
absolver is nothing like dark souls and the fact that people use that
no
that was a weird comparison 
its like if absolver was for normies
is that titanfall is the best AAA shooter
i guess what im trying to say
its like crack
tbh
anything that lets you attach to a point and swing around it at ludicrous speeds
r the future 
grappling hooks
yea
which is also why i think titanfall is so good, cause it takes this weird thing and makes it apply to a fps
is multiplied by the speed you can achieve per level
where the amount of possible fun in them
it’s just that platformers have this thing
tbh
not a complaint 
lmao
o
u are the platformer king
ofc you did
oh you fucjin already did it
and more momentum 
just to add more speed to the game
is make the pull pull you faster 
the most i’d say to add
coolest movement 
best game
that game is fucking awesome btw
s i c k
 what u up to rn?
mhm
its a really good fuckin album is what it is
c l a s s i c
its
my god is the sun tho
i mean

i 
wow i said instant vagina
trust
instant vagina
share these with any girl
the sneks with hats guy
also
as the blurry pictures of dogs guy
they stray from my job
i mean
ic
yuh
on the plus side, i guess i just have time now to get drunk as fuck
naw man it sucks cause i don’t get any m o n e yyyy
i just got to work and they told me i was good and could go home
;n;
t r a i n   s h m a i n
his name is deleted. and he’s got rly rly rly rly really bad taste in music
i gotta rp with my new best friend 
sorry man idk if i can make it to tha rp tmrw
oh my god
ppffpfhthhhfpfpppfffffftffffttftpfhtftwhat?
and said, fuck these kids they’re never gonna figure this one out
took a fat ass bong rip
its very likely they just slapped that shit together
yeah
yep
yeah
tbqh
dont think dgio is a better opening then dilemma 
i also
but then you end with
so you could go dgio-outro-dilemma
a perfect loop
to make
is that outro flows into dilemma 
the problemo there
but as is its already like 5x more enjoyable 
i’ll probably move lindas somewhere
i didn’t do any of the actual work
not after hahaha tho
nah
maybe after streaky
i think linda's in custody could go somewhere between streaky and death grips is online
disappointed
the thing said after uh 
ooooof
did i not?
cause streaky's uh thing is hinted at in black paint
js
streaky is also perfect
black paint into fuckin
yeah lmao
but apparently it flows perfectly into outro
reddit made it
horn into files is prob better
the only one that i think is off is horn section into linda's in custody
and lil richard into horn section
fear into little richard is also good
but fuck its so good
i mean i love the fear
dilemma into the fear
yeah dude i love
like extra shitty
yeah
playlist is public if you wanna give it a shot
riot's saying they're revealing a new champion on your birthday and it's weird
also
 Dilemma - The Fear - Little Richard - The Horn Section - Linda’s In Custody - Flies - Black Paint - Streaky - HaHaHa - Disappointed - Shitshow - Death Grips Is Online (Get Noided Lose Your Mind) - Outro
wtf
so good
dilemma into the fear is actually
ok i think this might actually work
done
lookin this shit up on reddit
hol up imma reorganize yots real quick
cause the album is all out of order
idk, it’s why i don’t listen to yots all that much either
maybe if itbwas ordered differently
i like albums that flow
understandable
really good
but the songs individually are actually pretty good 
its still a little all over the place
nah like a 7
i guess its an alright album
is pretty good
post voce simul
everything in the julia holter album
ok
What happened here?
It was delicious
ye
rly
and write four pages of that
and restate
you fluff
its complete bullshit
and also the writing seven page essays off of three pages worth of info
in my lit classes i just couldn’t stand the material
i hate essays even when you get to be creative
yuck

voce is the best one
holy shit
in the setting for my dnd thing
actually i could probably use a lot of these
i like voce simul
they arent a group
because
but not as a group
i could maybe listen to songs individually 
too much variety 
ok i dont think i like this album
ok the next song has a violin?
a looooot of acid tho
like
kkb on acid
like uhh
whether sounds
i like turn the light on
is not
this new shit
was
turn the light on
the first song
well
i love noise rock
this is straight noise rock
why’d u say i wouldnt like aviary 
also
i’ve talked about ranting to companies before, but this one, i’ve gotta actually do it.
this makes me i n c r e d i b l y   u p s w t
aurora isnt even on the playlist 
hah, fuck this bitch im gonna make sure she gets no new viewers
and they were like
sounds like someone at spotify who doesn’t like bjork was tasked with making this playlist 
what the fuck
why is that song 24???
her highest rated song on spotify is its oh so quiet, right?
like
why do you have to listen to the entire album before you get to her shit that’s actually really good
this is why
yea
the this is: bjork playlist on spotify is kinda makin me mad

its ost is better than its plot lmao
jfc
bad dog no biscuits too
bebop is mostly good because of the songs tank! and rush
so much better than bebop
actually bruce lee and his gang of rag-tag bozos in a space opera would be
but set in  space
cause spike is just shitty bruce lee
i like cowboy bebop
fuck you
ay 
but the focus isnt on those tropes

i
ic ic

s m h
smh
you fucking look at V??????
V?
v?
that compiles all the parts
im gonna wait until a full version comes out
it wasn't
no
both games just shit all over asgore
that shit was a feelsbadman
goddam
esp running into asgore
that made me want to play the game
was dank
walking around town at the end
that said
just bring that shit back
that could have saved this game's soundtrack
shoulda reused the old shop theme
the music was shit
and maybe it's because undertale's was much better
the comedy was subpar
yeah
not till later
but nah
i thought you were gonna fight
lancer is a highkey bool
she was just boolin
nah i liked her arc with lancer
but she was an actual character
not that she was cool
yeah
suzy
what's her face
i liked uh
yeah
ah
no there's 1 spare option per enemy
like sparing isn't faster
it's really easy to kill the enemies too
yeah i guess so
idk i think combat is broken cause healing
i reaaaaly didn't like how it pushes you to befriend everyone
yeah
but like coulda just made him someone new
*monster
i knew he was a tutorial monste
yeah
there should have been more new characters
what the fuck.
...
oh
what's ralsei an anagram for?
but frisk is a better name
unless kris is frisk
frisk doesn't exist?
weird too cause
ughhhhh
oh no undertale 2 is made of chapter based releases?
dumpsters everything else noname has made so far
and this song
i just listened to montego bay for the first time
so
oh no i misclicked on league aaaaaahhh killll meeeee
3 is more equal than the others
no
that fuckin mouth
3 is the best one
n i c e
send link?
?
that happens
holy shit l m a o
i am enraptured 
holy what
*guess
i guyss
outplayed 
jonah sent it to me a few weeks ago
ive seen this
no
they typically have 0 substance
aaa games are like action movies
and even then its only rpgs
i usually only play aaa games once the price drops below 30 bucks
its just that they use multiplayer to squeeze money out of everything they can
in general rockstar’s realky good with single player games
i had heard about the music being good already though so i wasn’t worried about that
like the instruments are the same and you get tidbits of western songs, but music comes in and out like botw, and whenever you commit crimes theres this drone that plays that’s fucking fantastic 
not standard western at all
the game would be shit if the sound design wasn’t what it is though
so it can be forgiven 
there are a few holes that come from it being an open world game that lets you fuck around for days on end between missions, but that’s reaaaally hard to account for
the story and characters are very well written though
so the game’s like, yeah, go kill shit and steal everything. just don’t get caught or we’ll fuck you up
i think i only like this because you are in no uncertain terms playing as the villain.
there’s good customization in terms of like clothing and making your guns look good
what the fuck
dude the light diffuses through the skin of your guy’s ears
their lighting
the best looking game i’ve ever played
it is also
i’ve never been able to be so evil in a videogame
but i love this shit
dude i hate westerns
its so worth it
i spent the 50 i was saving for smash on red dead redemption 2
it was gud
ty
but now im never gonna look at fantano’s content again
i was gonna look a review of his up
fuck fantano 
this is the best
i love it
thats what i want from a review 
the man has standards. And if you dont meet them, fuck you
thats alpha as fuck
annihilates bowie post mortem
f u c k i n g    d e s t r o y e d
giving out 10s devalues 10ams
d a m n
rate alpha/10
does he shit on albums?
savage?
cool
rly
there isnt a lot of jazz being released tho
wtf
he does jazz reviews?
on kanye
and he’s doing rap reviews
the dude’s a hardcore alternative fan
it would be better if he hadn’t tried to branch out and review all the popular shit that he doesn’t normally listen to
which means he has nothing in particular you can trust his opinion on
he tries to review everything
i think fantano spreads himself too thin
yes
lmao
but reborn is 100% kid cudi
i like the title track and reborn
so its not a good album
but they’re not bangers because of kanye
in his defense, kids see ghosts has two bangers
yeh i feel
tbh
i still mind
or rotten tomatoes says this is bad, so its bad
or fantano likes this, i like this
popular friend likes fantano, i like fantano
sheep mentality 
idk what to call it
most people have pretty shit uhh
where people literally say nothing
fantano and then a bunch of stupid reaction videos
youtube music reviews is like
and established a large following in a relative vacuum 
because he branded himself well
yeah
do you still value fantano’s opinion on anything?
suh
thats the w h o l e roster
we knew ken was coming
so only piranha plant was confirmed?
he he eks dee
fk smash just play absolver
lul
what the fuck
what did you just say?
what
15/10 would do again
finally took the mask off
mission failed
abort
abort
society has fallen apart
THAT CHARACTER IS LITERALLY “SEX AND BAD DECISIONS, THE CHARACTER”
WHAT PARENTS ARE LETTING THIER FUCKING KIDS DO THIS AAAA
WHY ARE THERE 9 YEAR OLDS OUT DRESSED AS HARLEY QUINN FROM SUICIDE SQUAD
is the best holiday 
cause halloween 
i’ll walk it off by walking my dogs with my gas mask and post apocalyptic shit on
whatever 
and that makes me feel shitty enough
but thats only for things that have already been offered
i’ll ask for things, every once in a while
i mean
probably the first time i’ve actually had to do it honestly
this is like
yea
probably a normal thing too
and instead just stress as much as humanly possible 
what, 6 hours?
i just will never ask for help until the last
yeah she does
but nah
well maybe
nah
yeah
where i wont ask people for anything if i cannot immediately make it back up
cause i’ve got some sort of complex
i’ve known ive had to do it for like 2 weeks, but haven’t 
its just lame
yeah
well
so i’ve gotta text my mom and ask for help
so i made about 900
but i got scheduld way less often this month
more or less
like 1250
which i have barely been able to cover so far
coupled with my phone bill and other things that’s like 1200 a month
but the shit’s 950 a month
i’d be fine in that case
i could do it if it was like between 300 and 700 a month
*condition under which
which was the condition that shed help by covering my part of the rent
but it was costing her a lot, and i i quit school
june
my mom was helping until uh
she didn’t 
but now its fucking me
which was fine when i wasn’t paying rent
but now it’s 105
the phone was like 2 months away from being paid off too, which would have made my phone bill like 60 bucks down from 80
not ur bad lol
i said seat tho
because i leave it covered
it was covered when she came in
the lid sorry
not the seat
idk
to use the toilet 
but she couldnt have missed my phone on the ledge 
i mean i get it she’s used to leaving it up whatever
and then not pay attention enough to close the toilet seat
but why did she barge into the bathroom in the first place
much like me losing my cards now wasnt wholly her fault
which like
and when the alarm rung it vibrated off the counter and into the toilet 
anyway she barged in to piss while i was takin a shower and left the toilet seat up when it was done
and i’d hear it
and had it there so the alarm could go off
which is right next to the toilet
had the toilet seat down and my phone on the edge of my sink
i was taking a shower
yea
i just want money for her killing my phone a couple months ago
for a long period of time 
even though i doubt i can pay this rent
but i’ll just have to confront her about it
i’ll stick it out
but no, my brothers are too much
well maybe 
my dads but i don’t want to do that
not with cleo
maybe
because its very very serious and i dont want to get myself in any sort of situation 
cant talk about that one
but whatever
there shouldn’t have been any straws once i started paying rent
well no
actually the first thing should have been the last straw
and the second most recent thing probably should have been the last straw, but i’m unreasonably forgiving.
idk i’ve been pissed for a while about very many things having to do with her
and she’s not wrong
she’s a self described “fucking bitch”
and then she passed out with that shit in the washer
so i did
then she demanded i lend her my laundry card because hers was out and she was too lazy to go refill it
cause last night my aunt barged into my room while i was teaching milo absolver mechanics, started talking shit really loud and questioning me about what i was doing and who, pretty aggressively in a way im sure she thought was funny
im sorta pissed because of the coincidences surrounding it. 
yeah
i probably dropped them in the hallway while doing my aunt’s laundry at two in the morning
fucking tore my room apart loojing for them
i lost my debit card and my laundry card
goddammit
will do this shit when i get back
neway i gotta go out and get cleo some chicken
it's fucking nerdy as shit standard fare undertale
actually
it's standard fare undertale
it's not depressing
this fucking game is going to be depressing
i got past character creation
nvm
and i am enraptured
that game has the best gameplay for a shooter that i've ever seen
because
and i don't know if i want to pause this for titanfall 2 videos
im doing this instead of watching videos of titanfall 2
yeah
fucking sweet
that better be a meme
okay
its called survey program
it
is this a meme?
uh
by stuffing your mouth with candy and booze
you should spend the night getting better
it's halloween anyway
aight
cause i said i’d do it earlier this year
i only play league now either with you or to finish getting gold this season
o o f
they were just jealous that i was able to quit league
hell yes
 and he admitted that it is a fun game
t o   p l a y   a b s o l v e r
i   g o t   m i l o
i    d i d   i t
weird af
i just saw this girl drive by my job that looked just like maisie williams
nah it is
you wont get what you want, i mean
you wont get what you want, i mean
this might be 2018’s slammer of the year
jfc
long road no turns
jesus fuck man
shit the daughters album is fire though
yea its good
theres nothing harder than cop imo
but its fuckin sick
i still find it grating
and young god
filth and cop
yea exactly
but older than us
not old
most swans fans are older tho
really
yup
gotta like all three, and all of ice age’s albums, i nearly said all of swans but i doubt thatd ever happen
im gonna marry her on the spot
when i find a girl who likes bambara, swans, and iceage
i’ve decided
i c
were you alone at the gira show?
that's weird tbh
really?
most people these days are either drunk, high, or at work.
she was probably drunk though
fuckin destroyed
gottem
*you're
and your'e fine
so just refuse to let people buy you anything
if i spend a bit of my survival points on some girl and get led on imma be pissed
money = food = survival
as long as i don't spend any money or anything
i personally don't mind being led on
good enough point
why not?
just for practice
don't go get picked up by her
well
lmao
you shoulda flirted back
just roll with it
whattt
what?
like
ah
you've gotten a venerable amount of chin scruff in recent times
that's fair
im just messin tho
u were at a gira show it'd have been cool
you should have punched her in the mouth
that's fucking rough
oh damb
uncomfortable
it's uh
i feel your pain
that's me like 5 days a week
dude
CoMiSsIoN 72 tHe OnE wHeRe QiTaRa DiEs
you mothafucka
no?
are you back?
back
imma walk these doggos then
okok
.
what time we starting?
yuh
yea drunk swans i’ve done
kk
not tonight cause i gotta work at 10 am tmrw
so tomorrow its goin down again
but i got some edibles on fri
friday
uhh
but i didnt try that
rhye woulda been good
oh shit
Oh it was
i listened to mother of the world lmao
swans is not aight
for me
man of oil high was too much
anco sounds alright
*cool
oh coil
a bit too much
but can’s drum lines are like
maybe
i cant listen to swans high cause it scares the shit outta me
bjork is good music to listen to when you’re drunk or high
you know what
wasnt skype
that
Yeah it should
its the dmv tho. never come without an appointment i guess
i made the same mistake last night
understandable though
nono lmao
running simultaneously 
if there werent also queues for A, B, C, and F
which would be fine
I’m G278
they just called G248
i wanna die man
and now its 4:05
i’ve been at the dmv since 2:30
so
lmao
THERE ARE DOZENS OF US!!!
lul
Yeah they are
same
“shark eyes get tangled in the wolf skin, urgent plea of escape,” are my favorite lines ever.
specially cause
despite that
id still call the album a 10 tho
3 mins and change
so the downtime is 3 mins
l’via doesnt get goin till 40 secs in
especially since lvia has its own windup
but not 2:30
you could use some
well
the ending of the widow is kinda chill in comparison. you don’t need wind down time
but cygnus’s ambiance has a lot of stuff going on
the endings of cygnus and miranda are really hard
still gonna say l’via is my favorite song on the album tho
the ending to the widow doesnt need to be 2 and a half minutes long
and the ending
oh
after miranda
but the lyrics are fantastic, maybe second best
is that it feels a little too slow at points cause theres a lot of guitar shredding space
the only thing about the widow that i dont like
actually what am i talking about
jesus
in con safo
but the fucking horns
plant a nail in the navel stream is my favorite part of the sond hands down
like
but it helps me pick out parts that i like with names
so you can still listen to it all the way through
well the song doesn’t stop
and it made listening to it on spotify much more enjoyable
for a long time
with different names
had like different parts
i didnt realize cassandra gemini
gonna have to change that rym rating
oh cool
it just isnt as good as everything else
widow isnt bad
the mute?
frances
jfc
cause its so depressing 
did his wife rly have a miscarriage?
but june’s better
because slow savage lyrics are god tier
it was really really tough
as the album’s “sad song”
june is better than slow savage
ive decided
after a solid month
ok
but yea that face aint natural
those got me
flopping
the arms
this was the actual show
and the spiders freakin out
it was just them putting the stuff on the spiders
it didn't have half the scenes
well
the nat geo show this one was based off of
id seen the original though
that was the first time i've seen it
rl
ikr
fuckin
lmfao
to put u to sleep
nice asmr
some
hey man.
just call when u ready nw
oof
:0
sounds good
classic
this is funny
a r e   y o u   r e a d y?
b r u h
the babadook might be more apt
or maybe the babadook
i'd say it's the exorcist
on a scale of edgy
but i want to do it so bad
it could be the edgiest shit
it could be edgy
in dnd
im gonna play this girl
one day
thats awesome 
and that was pretty cool
at least in terms of music
a slightly heavier ice age
bambara reminds me of like
it was pretty solid
lmao
o shit
wat
pretty fucking hilarious actually 
yea he was fuckin going around hugging everyone in the front row while he was singing
awesome 
lmfao
who i liked
they were preceded by these guys called bambara
so at the idles concert
np
gotta walk doggos but i’ll do it when i get back
i got it from bandcamp just gotta generate a new link
oof
yuh
and the voice hurts my ears
but the singer is like a 17 year old white kid going through a screamo phase
but the singer is like a 17 year old white kid going through a screamo phase
is it sounds like it’s trying to be death grips
my problem with new machine girl
is a fantastic name
this is your face on dogs
oh shit
havent heard the new one
young and arrogant is the shitty one
there
i was talking about young and arrogant 
OH
gemini’s dank
wait no
that ones dank
oh
4/10 album, no meme
nope
which
or missy punk
cause there arent any beats that are nearly as good as some from  wlfgrl
actually 5/10
3/10 lyrics 6/10 music
ehh
but the shit he does say when you can is like
but like you can barely hear the singer like 50% of the time cause it’s mixed almost specifically so you can’t 
*always
not alwayd
and its 600% edgier
cause everything has lyrics
i dont like it asmuch
i have
whew
that shit
i can see getting stuck on on my fingers though
ohh lmao
glassy eyed is good competition though
cimmerian shade took like 6 or so listens though, before i could get into it. But its by far the craziest song on the album
and the chorus fuck it
also the bride of stay is fucking fantastic
i fucking love that shit
yup
20/20 meme
flamingo is just the best for the memes
thats the best kkb song that i’ve heard so far
gotta check out the rest then
ohhh yep
whats that new song then?
hmm
lipslap is on it right?
yeaaaaa
lmao
...

B R U H
b r u h
arright
oof
?
so what you been workin on
you make a post and you've got dnd fiends screaming at you in 15 seconds
too well actually
too well actually
too well actually
it works
and they did
and i had to tell them to calm the fuck down
there were hungry monkeys running at me for like 2 hours
it's not too bad
that's what i did the other time
yuh
so he got in by nature of being in the right place at the right time
he was the first to respond to the post i made about the campaign
i found this dude on reddit
im gonna corrupt him
im gonna do it
because im gonna turn him into a cynical asshole
and he’s my favorite 
this guy
uh
now weve got
so
uh
now we've got
yeah
so i threw his sleeping sack of a body on an altar and had him sacrificed by magic and then the campaign ended
cause one of the guys from the old one has fallen asleep in the middle of the last five sessions
im corralling another gaggle of idiots for a new dnd campaign of erics
wassup dood
yuh
when u bring up linkin park ur bringing up nobody’s listening 
no way
it was the hottest shit
people loved it when it was current
bruh its old
no it aint
wot
had to cut that shit short
my phone was boutta die here
(noworries)
:D
and now im hungover and deaf
i been hungover all day
i cant hear shit
man
if i remember 
i’ll send pics later
ye
way better than everything else
love song
fuck man
yea man
with like 60 people
then moshed up there
i got pulled on stage
they’re crazy
fuck man
yuh
holy shit
we in it
yo
if u care about that sorta thing
getting assblasted makes it easier to improve tho
shit was rough
like there was when i bought the game
actually he probably doesn't even care about that. it's active if that's what he's askin. it hasn't really ever not been. but there's been a lot of newer people since the free month, so theres definitely people for him to fight against that wont just assblast him every 20 seconds
the regular dodge is a bit too strong, thats all
a few things gotta be fixed
it's going alright
uh
fucc a ducc
oof l m a o
or try to
we can start earlier so u can sleep on time
arright
ur wat
you’re not free thurs tho r ya?

FUCK
BECAUSE IDLES START AT 8
I CANNOT RP ON WEDNESDAY 
 OH SHIT
sweet

wednesday tho right?
wednesday tho right?
motor bike
ye
just need to give it a tune up
i bought a bike
and now work is over
yuh
work and work
right?
jk
jh
but thAT SHIT GAY AND WE AINT HAVING IT NO MORE
yeh
i'll never confront problems, always try to go around or ignore them
where it's an option
in any situation
just like i can't pretend to be confrontational very well
u can't put on a mask if you don't know how to make it
i figured that
yuh
with a bit of caution tape that says "don't come here"
or a sorta funny one
it's like putting on a cool mask
that shit was blocking me from having real interactions with people
ye
to i think
trying
makes me depressed\
i don't think i can keep up the aloof always joking always sarcastic thing any more
same goes from me
it'll happen more often from here on out i think, ty man
it's pretty crazy
yeah
they're some of the only emotionally close conversations i've ever had though
true
yeah i definitely needed to write it down
right?
i think
better to know than to not know
i think i'm done for now
fuck man sorry to dump everything on you
idk
and the only reason i got those scores was cause i never did any homework
i guess
just cause they sorta got it
but i got d's and my teachers bumped everyone up to c's
i got a c in english since he let us make up our work
i got d's in every non-practical subject
luckily i had some understanding teachers in 12th grade at marshall
but at that point it was just habit
until eventually it was easier to let me fail in high school than to force me to work
*on
and she started giving up easier as time went o
but after a bit she gave up
yeah i lied at those points
*motherfucker
but i'm a stubborn motherfucke
she did
well
she didn't push me
yuh
i could, i have every reason to, but i won't get anything out of that
is all im saying
but i shouldn't be mad about it
i know
and isn't going to college because of it
and didn't work
and now, being a little fucker that learned from what he saw, i became a lying motherfucker who doesn't want to work
purely because she didn't want to work and she wanted to spend time with the baby that she loved
because she did it at the expense of both my dad and myself
i guess i just shouldn't feel anything about it.
idk
but also i can't
i should maybe appreciate it
i don't know
which
and all throughout that time my mom did her best to spend her time with me, she didn't want to work and she used every resource she had to make sure she could spend her time with me
i don't want to go through it again cause there's no need
and all that happened
probably through facebook
and met my mom again
then anthony came back
pretty sure the same thing happened to troi
but he tried and i didn't let him because i had already learned to hate him
there was no way in hell i'd ever have a relationship with him
4 days a month
i saw my dad once every other weekend
with my mom
well
in all that time i was living there
fucking shit man
and u showed me bionicles
yea lmfao
mhm
but i think i went over to your house a couple times
yeah idk if you ever came over before then
bunk beds yeah
ye
because i was going to like elementary school and we met in kindergarten
actually i think i moved there a little after i met you
i think so
yeah
and she won, and we moved to the house in culver city, on somersett drive
it may have been that jesse and rita who my mom had met by then convinced my mom at that point to sue him
then the sueing thing probably happened
and started her whole spiritual journey i guess
he got my mom into the SRF
who i think my dad fuckin hates now
jesse owens who was a bitch and i pretended to like him to make my mom happy
there were a bunch of other guys that came in and out after that
and you are my helpless guinea pig in this endeavor
i just want to try and get as many facts straight as possible
i know my mom has had lesbian relations since that, just not before as well
it doesn't matter
and i mean
ya
for a bit
that the julisa person was my mom's girlfriend.
no
i can't prove it one way or another, so i won't say it's true or disqualify the idea
but that's a pretty fitting answer
and i had no idea how they became friends or how they stayed friends after my mom broke up with my dad
so i had a godmother, julisa at about 3 or 4
my mom decided she was a lesbian for a bit after that
i think my mom had a friend who helped her make it
but it was well made
with tape, and stuff
like hand bound
it was bound
yeah
i don't think so
yep.
i just didn't remember
several times
and i know the book is real because i've seen it
anyway, my mom kicked him out and wrote a book called "I hate you," about my dad and talked shit about him to all his friends and shit
anyway
which makes her rich
she's good at setting trends and making trendy places/things
and now she does interior design and is big in that scene as well
and she got super big off that
which got huge cause oprah started wearing her stuff
and then she started that clothing company
*set
so she's step
with both a rich stepmother and a rich stepfather
born to a rich family
but he married claire who was rich
so he himself wasn't rich
and two years after that my mom and i came along
like as soon as he started picking up, rita came along with troi
because of choices he made
i don't think he himself was ever super rich
he worked with a lot of famous actors
when i was 3 or 5 or something
the suing him happened later
so idk
ever
but they weren't married
she did break up with him
my dad didn't say that
i don't know that
because of that my mom started to resent him and confront him about finding coke in his inner pockets and shit
idc
he probably was
and my dad did a photo shoot with a bunch of lesbians out in the desert, and my mom thought he went out and was fucking them
outward vs inward i guess
my mom taught kids in an elementary school and painted
my dad surfed through parties and worked with musicians in their world, making music videos and art with people 
but they had lifestyles and ideas of what the ideal lifestyle was and they clashed
im pretty sure my mom and dad loved each other. 90%
my mom wasn't a gold digger
moving on
okay
maybe once every two years
enough to not want to do this regularly
but idk i like the energy, don't like the shit myself part
coke kills you quickly if you get addicted
redbulls kill you slowly
lmfao
there aren't enough hours in the day to make up all this shit
im too behind
fuck me man
and troi knew all this shit for a full two years and i had no idea
but different
troi and i are in similar situations
idk where i left off
uh
whatever
so fucking full of energy im on the verge of shitting myself
like a drank 6 redbulls
im fucking charged with energy rn its crazy
and all of those can wait rn
last three things i need to do are clean my room, take three showers and then go hang out with troi at like 6-7 pm
okay okay
this shit is so fucking clean too
we innit
alright found a dude and contacted him
mhm
but because i hate driving cars and i've wanted to do so for like 6 years
not because it's the edgy cool guy thing
among other things
i gotta buy a motorcycle
im glad u are asking questions cause theres a lot id miss otherwise
it’s understandable 
yeah
ye
about that bullshit
talking to the owner there
oh no
doing that
Now i feel like i can get a sandwich from there again. And will soon.
that was my last half hour
anyway
because that’d be absolute bullshit
and didn’t ask
i wasnt collecting unemployment from them
i mean its the same shit
i would fuckin walk on the other side of the street to avoid being in front of the store
havent talked to him since
like 6-7 months
and i realize that and am trying to get better
so had to tell him i was a little shit
cause i was too introverted and pussy-like to talk to anyone for 5 seconds to put in a time off request
and i didn’t tell them
and was in utah on a weekend i was supposed to work
cause i went on a trip with my mom
the cheesesteak place
i had to stop by my old job
this is gonna be a fucking pain in the ass
i got a lot of shit to do today, fml
similar positions
but its a little different
so troi is in the same position i am
we back
shit has been found
and find a fuckin bathroom omfg
i’ll be back when i get a chance to charge it
shit
my phone’s about to die
that wasn’t actually going to troi, of course
and then a couple months later she was throwing him out the house and collecting an egregious amount of money for child support
yuh
and that rita was pregnant
and found out he was on his honeymoon
and then woke up a week later in tahiti
or something close enough
and he was saying i do
then he woke up in a black car with a woman named Rita, emphasis on the T.
probably 1990-94 or 95
where you wake up once every 3 weeks and think “what the fuck”
like 1 long continuous high
he said he was blacked out for a year or three
but uh
and i’ve never remembered any of that
but when he was talking to me i started remembering shit from when i was 5-10
i mean i cant verify this
and apparently she was a gold digger and took advantage of my dad being a party-mongering dumbass 
rita is troi’s mom
well my sister and i have different moms
i cant like
and after
yeah
last night
my dad mostly told me about my sister’s and my moms
idk where to start
yeah
and so i passed the fuck out and am feeling much better
i ended up not typing anything cause it woulda been rambling crap that wouldn’t make sense anyway
better than ever tbh
im okay
yuh
wearing off
yuh
who knows
or too much 
nm
im awake
hfs im dying
fucj
fuck
fuck
fuck
peace my guy
100%
cause i cant wait to play em and i believe yore gonna be the best
get some rest and get those fat As so u can start makin those 11/10 games
nw nw
you can go to sleep, but i will keep talking cause i don’t think i can stop myself rn.
i sor
right right
*too...that
im a writer bruh and theres to much i gotta say my head cant keep up cause i ran a new game plus and started with minor dyslexia tjat makes me spell words wrong 4 times in a row
nuh this about regular past a certain threshold
[1538715732] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: i also did a bitta cocaine and smoked some very very strong weed before starting the drinking

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
yes bruh r u payin attention?
holy fuck i got so lost
thats kinda crazy though
and just make sense
could explain why zodiac signs work so often
12 reincarnations?
so 12 zodiac signs 12 whats? 12 lives?
but when china cane up with the zodiac people were counting years in 10s
12 months in the yeat
right
12 zodiac signs
that resonated very weirdly
my dad told me slme crazy shit
a little less if you count the discrepancy caused by me growing older and getting shitter while also having more power to make my own choices.
for 21 months
once every half month
i spent every other weekend with him
so w/e i can match tone if i need to
but thats what it feels like
and is therefore pretty fuckin gay
it sounds like a gay melodramatic anime powerup scene
because im remembering so much
im worried i wont remember this
shit
kk
you dont have to respond if it gets too late.
gimme a sec
mhm
i cant allow that to happen rn
i cant die yet
people die
its not good
yeah
wont
yea
i know she does because i watched her do it
my aunt too
yeah im sure he does
i may partake
but in times where the situation is controlled where i make the decision to do do
dw i wont become a cokeheaf
the coke is keeping me awake to write this rn
so thst may explain the weirdnesd
i also did a bitta cocaine and smoked some very very strong weed before starting the drinking
5th dimensional, but definitely not.
3 dimensional, but not.
2 dimensional, but not.
i use a metaphor of a painting bevause thats sorta how i picture life as right now
the worst thing you could fo is decieve other people as to who you are, and where they fit into that picture 
so with your life as a piece of that picture 
every person is a force trying to reach its destination 
force, if you want to keep the religious possibilities.
everyone is just energy
in any aspect
lying about who you are
because lying is the worst thong you could do to someone
well yeah
on pain of being a shithead
and refused to get what i wanted
is that i didn’t ask
the only reason i’m not a cunt fucking bastard who deserves the fires of hell
in fact
i pretended i was poor and that i understood the situations of poor people when i had no idea and knew i had no idea.  because i wanted to be normal and wasn’t, because  both of my my parents were filthy fucking rich and i could have gotten anything i wanted by asking fpr it
so i sympathize with assholes and i pretend i am anything other than that
and because of what the truth is and because of what i’ve dine. i am the worst asshole i know
i have lived my entire life pretending something that is untrue
instead of living from a place of truth
i was walking the walk that i was being told i had to walk by my mom.
and i hate him because of it
and every time i look at him im reminded of this lie that my entire life is
because he’s living the same thing
but i cant talk to che
che was the same thing
and thats the only way i could connect with people because thats supposed to be the only people i understand 
we’re walking different walks, but i spend my whole life trying tp pretend we’re walkong the same walk
because it is
it sounds fucked up
and i that was it
“poor”
and we were poor
so fucking mad cause it was so easy and they were paying her 1400 dolars
mad at her.
and when i did that for het i was so maf
which was every month
when ever she asked me to
but shes a graphic designer and i did her work for her in two minutes for her and walked out the room in three minutes
MY MOM DRIVES A PORCHE AND WORE DESIGNER CLOTHES for 14 years of my live, but i just had the coolest gameboy because we are poor but she loves me so much that she sacrifices herself every day for me
and my MOM AND MY DAD ARE RICH
because I AM POOR
but i hated being rich
poor
i hate pretending to be poir
what the fuck
i need to call my therapist 
what the fuck
holy shit
because thats all i know
and now i lie all the time every day over nothing
because of a lie
fpr my mom who i loved
to perpetuate a lie
because im a terrible liar an i needed to lie
i didnt do a great job
everyone and every thing in every interaction 
because my dad is fucking filthy rick
i’ve always been scared to talk about money
and i did
i had to pretend we were poor
so in prder to tell that truth 
but she told me we were poor
she always had designer shoes abd designer purses
and she spent all her money on clothes and shoes and purses
i dont know
even though she didn’t have a job and didn’t do anything
i remember that my mom managed to sue him for 500.000 dollars and buy our house in crenshaw
but i remember this
i’ve bever remembered anything 
and i remember it all
but he’s done so much
and i could have if given the chance
i wanted to go to his house and kill everyone and myself
and i wanted to kill him
i fucking hated him
but i hared my dafd
in a stupid way that doesn’t matter
but not in the same way
been a pos to you too
no i’ve
because thats not allowesmf
but i can’t tell ghim
im so sorry
i’ve been such a piece of shit
fuck
my dads had it so rough
cause fuck me
but thattll be just yout mind
itll seem like im an older brother or smthing
yes
and get fucked up together
we gotta go to a bar

holy fuck
I am not at school

36 DOLLARS I DON"T HAVE THAT RN
there's no right side of the bed with a body like mine and a mind like mine
THEY'RE FUCKING SOLD OUT
oh fuck they're playing so close to me
and couldn't find anything bigger
its sorta like the fools who make these covers of crazy, like they could ever make anything near as good as gnarls barkley's version
you can't ever compare to the nina simone version
i'd say it's a 3.8 at least
that's fuckin rough
dark shine's piano
i thought i wasn't gonna make rent this month while still having money for food next week but i found 50 bucks in my backpack/jacket
i got 4 days before i get to become a hardcore alcoholic and ruin my life
how ya doin man?
cool
ic
hmmmmmmm🤔🤔🤔🤔
but in the direct comparison it was against “uncle nows got cancer in his brain. uncle nows got cancer in his brain and his lungs.”
i already liked it
i like love song a lot more on the third time through
goes and it goes and it goes?
isnt colossus just a guillotine copy?
also
but gothos still the best song
*25 seconds
yea the first 20 seconds of date night is my favorite part of the album
and all those shades of grey YUCK they turn my blood so cold cold COLD COLD
and all those shades of grey YUCK they turn my blood so cold cold COLD COLD
and then fuck the rest
i do not like your BEST FRIEND
BEST FRIEND
but i try to shake shake SHAKE IT OFF but i shake my self to boredom.
ive got no god damn PATIENCE
PATIENCE
fuckin
but like
so after that i skip to the next song.
but i dont like the rest of the song even half as much
just to hear it
that i’ll restart the song like 10 times in a row
i like the first verse of date night so much
holy shit i didn’t do any of that
lemme finish this one that's going tomorrow
you're boutta have nothing to say
you have no idea how many slime related insults i've got ready
he just isn't very good at
if you can't tell there's oxium afoot there, too
bruh im so happy it's season 7
(noworries) 
OI
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy lmk when u ready to go
they mostly just want to fight with all the new shit
ye
thats just so dirty
theres one fucking kick
fuk
seen
also came with a new class, which is bruce lee style. and it’s the most stylish, bm, motherfucking shit i’ve ever sene
and its fucking gorgeous 
with boss fights and shit
that you can go through 3 versions of with 3 people
with randomized rooms
but the new update is a pve expansion that adds a rougelike-esque dungeon
the main game is 1v1 abd 3v3
its really fucking gucci
so that's what i was doing all last night
nice
or just tryhard until you got 100%
around the whole map?
did you make a ring?
o:
not that that isn’t impressive as fuck, im just wondering if its a thing that’s happened
so there isnt an actual way to get 100%?
also dont people spawn inside you
was that teams?
nice job
but they have the best name ever
and i dont like their music
i found a band called “pigs pigs pigs pigs pigs pigs pigs”
so bad
but the corn scenes are a 15/10 because of how fucking hilarious they were
that movie is a 1/10
that was the one thing they needed to keep consistent and they couldn't do it
it's not even hard
undeniable proof that he is an idiot that has no idea what he's doing
AND NOW THE GIRL'S GONNA USE HER HEADPHONES EX MACHINA TO MAKE THE MONSTER COMMIT SUICIDE
SO IT DOESN'T DROWN
BUT IT ISN'T STUPID
HOLY SHIT THE BOY JUST PULLS HER OUT LIKE IT'S NOTHING WHERE WAS THAT STRENGTH EARLIER YOU FUCKIN IDIOT
AND NOW THE GIRL'S DROWNING IN THE CORN
SHE'S EVEN MORE RETARDED THAN HE IS
"dude wat"
OMG HE'S DROWNING IN CORN
the dad didn't see their clearly visible bonfire
this is why you wear a condom when you fuck in the sound apocalypse
OR the dad is an idiot and those things aren't blind at all and could just have moved the mattress whenever they wanted to
they're attractive idiots
this is the dumbest movie i've ever seen
also the mom shaming herself then immediately putting all the pressure in the world on the dad cause she's a bitch
she could have even had the immunity thing, and the problem would be about her trying to find her mom and brother while the baby's being born and the mom's screaming cause she stabbed her foot in the basement
but it's just the mom with the boy and the girl
she's literally got like an immunity bubble around her
the boy just grabbed the girl's hand out from under the tracter
the movie didn't need that scene
and couldn't hold in the yell
but they just didn't do them
even 4 year olds aren't that stupid
like "HELLO I AM HERE"
it's a 3 because the scene with the little baby kid was retarded
they're literally trying to kill themselves with that stupid shit
its just like that
yuh
MY MOTHER WORKS 15 HOURS 5 DAYS A WEEK
MY MOTHER WORKS 15 HOURS 5 DAYS A WEEK
after
i need a week to cool down
i’ll wait a week before i do that cause
i haven’t actually listened to it on its own tbh
so in comparison to brutalism, running down the tracks, joy is a piece of shit
remember this is a tracklist comparison review
and brutalism is the banger of the year for both 2017 and 2018
joy sucks dick
and came to the conclusion that actually 
side by side
i listened to the two albums
yea so
he runs out of points and just starts talking about nothing at all
i like how as the video goes on
I am so excited
or is wednesday the day?

cause its a dank fuckin meme
and so is the other one that i dont know the name to
 wlfgrl is solid
i mean its obvious he was before even when he was just sampling, but his lyrics are edgy 16 y/o weeb lyrics
cause machine girl is an edgy weeb and acts like it
the lyrics suck too
yea
nvm all the songs have lyrics 0/10 dont listen
i rate 4/10. perfection
i didnt even realize

heal/heel
well
im gonna need more time to test this theory, cause i gtg to work in a bit, but it seems like it might be true
date night puts danny nidelko in the dirt
like song by song lmao
actually nvm, in a direct comparison every song is just not as good as its counterpart in brutalism
or heal/heel
yea this album doesnt have anything like mother
this F U C K E R stole my sweater
the album in general
its a lil normie-er?
i like colossus
thats what’s important 
sweet
ik
y e a h
tbh idk if i like politics in my music too
more people wanna listen to joy than they do brutalism, huh
yea
thats why its more popular 
its because its called joy

next is pretty cool
maybe
but one day
ikr
yeah
doubt it
cause my pc is ass
i dont have it on pc
id say its worth a try
maybe idk
well
only if you still own it
too
they’ve got a pretty decent character creator thing
ye
or you can join friends and stuff
you can join random games and it’ll just pop you out near a dude
yea
you can join random games
and now suddenly its fun
they added more missions, base building, and actual multiplayer
but like
well planets are alright
the planets and like combat mechanics are still trash
pretty alright game
i haven’t finished it, but theres enough in there that i can definitely say it’s a 
and they fixed that game
i got no mans sky for like 10 bucks
so
what’s up?
my guy

i'd definitely do it if i had all day or something

and decided to use it on the least money intensive show format
so they had unlimited money
slice of life is like a show where each episode is made up of snippets of the characters daily lives
and its fucking hilarious 
its the deconstruction of a highschool girl’s life through a slice of life show with an unlimited budget
try nichijou
if you want something that’s the exact opposite of eva
now
like 10/10
they did a very good job with what they had left
and eoe fixed it for sure
not their fault
cause the budget cuts forced them to rush
well it was written poorly
cause that shit underwhelming
milo’s miffed

makes it look less weird
ye
nese
theres no way yugioh was made by anyone who’s not japabese
unless its yugioh
if they run it during regular viewing hours it doesn’t count
imo
pokemon’s not an anime

but

fairy tail is...

[7/11/2018 9:33:12 PM] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: if you listen to the fuckin words that he's saying&lt;&lt;&lt;
here's the thing about post malone
[7/11/2018 11:58:21 PM] cold hard southern man: BR OMEGALUL CKHAMPT OMEGALUL N&lt;&lt;&lt;
it's awful
i'm talking like omegalul
that's always the hardest part tho
i was laughing like a maniac
omg
i got to watch the people sqirm
and on the last one
3 times
i just used it like
is the best shit
in paper io
that ring strat
yo
and don't feel too bad about it
cause that's fucked up
and you can't just like
there wasn't any place to like
ah, yea that is pretty difficult 
oh ok then
long distance is hard to keep up  outside of college and stuff
why
oh okay
lul
o
ok
wanna talk about it?
holy wat
even though i don't want to
cause deep down i know i don't wanna give up voracious
and then i'd cri
now you're talking
i'm not trading voracious for shitty hank
it's fair
they're mine
no, they're mine? like a fuckin 6 year old fighting over bionicle
or else it ain't a punishment
you can't kill my characters, only yours
i'd have to kill like hmm
if you're late you have to kill a main character that you were planning stuff for
that's what's up
if that's what's up
i'll probably order more
but fuck if it didn't feel like it did
and it probably didn't do me any good
cause it's so good
then i'll be able to order soup
i don't want to sleep any more
this is just cause im sick as fuck
wont get anything done before i gotta sleep
its too late
No, def not
yeye u ready
cant sleep cause its so hot
its the worst
i can barely talk
probably better we didn’t rp anyway
but rn I’m really really fucking sick and Idk when I’ll get better
thurs and fri are good potentially 
um
nw
ye i get ya
s u n d a y
ok

it's not like very active freaking out
and she wasn't havin any fun
and i had cleo with me there and she was freaking out, i probably shouldn't have gone, cause she's been pretty upset today.
but i just can't remember it
i think there's probably a reason
so idk what the fuck else i've been supressing
i can barely remember anything about myself, and i've never been able to
and then said, "just look at mars, look how strong he is. mars how many pushups have you done?"
then in the conversation, my dad mentioned that whenever his sons are acting up he makes them do pushups, which is a thing i knew about, it's just that for the past six or seven years i couldn't remember that ever happening to me
and he doesn't remember when he got those tatoos, or know what they are.
cause it's part of a band of like 4 other things
and i didn't know that was there
I was high with him in the garage and I learned a few things
Anyway
and it was with him
last night
i was at my dad’s
it pended off the first too messages
wtf is this pending
wait
and i smoked the strongest weed i've ever smoked in my life with him.
tnrw then
im not even home
r i p
fk it
and the night after
r i p
O O F

saturday 
cause i forgot my sweater over there on like
heading over to milo’s
nm im
n i c e
&gt;.&gt;
the game takes a lot of grinding.
and it costs 5 of those blue triangles to get anything worthwhile
every level past level 60 gives you one blue triangle thing.
despite it looking nothing like that
that level roughly equates to 591
they look shiny
these shits
ye
for some dumbass reason you gain doritos in groups of 60
also
the actual level takes longer
but thats just your combat trials level
*loss
takes 5 points to level and you get 3 for every match won, 1 for every losd
its not hard to get them
nice meme
also just noticed this
yes, recognized by the g’s as a fellow g.
fuckin dying
and now im just
got invited to the secret “we’re really good at a game no one plays” club yesterday 
absolver mostly

ripan-ino
he’d like
get jonah to try it i guess
i gotta
it’s so good
when
none of my homies wanna bother trying absolver
when
so bad
feels
but big as in, important.
not big as in long
info wise, tho
pretty big
these two prologues are
i feel like
and will come back to it later
so i started this one
with another
i had that too
i understand
have it finished for ya soon
hopefully i’ll
just for you
spicy prologue
im working on a 
btw
but the phone itself will live on
several times over
i will probably break the screen
i will not break it
a headphone port
or until such time where i can commission a custom iphone with
indefinitely 
the 6
which means i will continue to use
same here
until they bring back the headphone port
i will continue to use a 6
i remain unconvinced.
eh
less bad
thats
i c
oh the dongle plugs into the phone
TWO ENDS?
it has
what do you mean
which is specific to the iphone
the headphones are specific to the iphone’s charge port
or anything
or ps4 controller
i dont wanna plug my iphone specific headphones into their dongle so i can use them on my computer
i dont like using extraneous shit to do the things i want to do
more to the point
im a heterosexual man i cant be messin around with dongles
i dont want to touch dongles
heres the thing
see but
i dont want to need specific headphones for my phone that are separate from the ones i use on my computer 
sort of okay
thats
well yea
oh
ur headphones run on a separate battery charge than ur phone does
b r u h
not that bad?
what u say?
anyway
So i have nothing to be upset about
i get to keep using the SUPERIOR CORDED HEADPHONES
and also
mhm
half as expensive 
except
buying the new iphones every 3 years
its basically the same as what everyone else does
w/e
i was like 4 months away from completely paying off that phone
only sad part was
128 gigs compared to 64, not that i USED all 64
the new phone is better anyway
so im no longer feeling extra depresso
8 packets worth of tips
like
i also just got handed
i just got off work and have two days off
sup
aight
and i'll drop my life's savings on a phone
accident's happen
can't do tomorrow either
lul
at work still
im
im not
Godspeed.
hahaha is so fucking good
streaky and black paint

it reignites my belief in humanity
when the wave goes full circle
the wave is the best part
is for the wave
the only reason to go to any sportsball games
fr tho
so i guess i’ll write some prologues
and i have omega cancer
so im now going to a dodger game
you fucking fuck bastard
fuck you sakurai
pos
but im talking out my ass cause we both know im gonna be a piece of shit ice climbers main
maybe even like robin’s mechanic
also i wont be happy with botw link if his shit doesnt break
since wolf link is midna’s b i t c h
more accurate
better yet just call her midna but make her ride wolf link
a n d   m i d n a
w o l f   l i n k
so it looks different
who gives a rats ass abt daisy in smash give me wolf link you chucklefucking scumlick fuck sakurai
you fuckers
but all that said, where the fuck is my wolf link and midna
idk how it’d work, but it’d be cool
stasis is kinda op in a fighter
the slate powers instead of items
i wonder if they’ll give him like
the bombs will look cooler
 yea botw link makes sense
roy’s not different
oi does young link have those fire arrows tho?
so lucina and roy are marth echoes?
so daisy, squid bih, and ridley are the newbies
holy shit man
even the smash 4 dlc peeps?
l m a o
FUCK
ICE CLIMBERS
what about the smash 4 dlc peeps
holy shit
im at work just say who
who?
you can't talk while looking for things?
what's goin on?
if we're gonna rp
yea
but it can have devastating consequences 
not strong powers on their own
lul
is that the full set?
the memory changing?
neon woulda lied in that case scenereo
is a good char trait
but the fact that she doesnt lie
before he asked polya
and say yes
i just said she could lie to loop
ik
yea
f
i never said she wiped herselg
wat
b r u h
yikers
and vica has two of them
if you count that other dude then its 4
but that makes 3 mindy bois
and loop would be all, “wow, holy shit im so happy”
and just lie about it
cause she can totally change his memories to something more normal
that whole sequence is a little bullshit
that said
also artifis is fuckin awesome
i s   c o m i n g
t h e   a g e a n   v a p o r
o o f
i ignored that thinking you were meming
fucc
you were downstairs?
did that mean
wait
 ight
yeesh
its hot as fuck tho
dogs have been walked
ok
where meet?
my address is 345 S Alexandria Ave
o o f
or season 12
season 13?
the end?
but im feelin the many
my best com is probably the heart
I feel you
gonna be a good one
i got very fucking hyped for season 8
at work today
also
the third one’s out of his gotdamn mind
yea man they made my heart all fuzzy so i had to share em with my main dude
the second boye’s got propeller legs
dude they’re freakin out
have these blurry pictures of dogs
in the meantime
so i can let you know how long its gonna take me to get there and we dont waste half an hour on like logistics
but if you guys are trying to figure out whats going on, just tell me when you know
im not saying force them
when you know whats up
so let me know whats up
 okay but i just spent like 6 minutes explaining why i dont want to do it that way
cause i can get to any kbbq place in like 2 seconds
or the thing we’re doing involves eating kbbq
unless ya come pick me up essentially
and the most realistic time we’d end up doing anything is at like 5:30
like if ya let me know at 3 the soonest we’d probably end up doing anything is 4:30
its just that i cant do spontaneous things quickly
its not that i dont like it
okay
ye to ur dads
but if the plan is to go to the grove i could get there in 20 mins
oh and that theres like 20 stops as well
 the problem with getting to your house quickly is that the nearest bus route takes like 6 blocks of walking, which makes it slow af
well it depends on where we plan on going
i can be done with everything by 3
and not deal with any spontaneous crap
lets make a plan
my shit is done
what do you meaaaan
like the grove, or anywhere on 3rd st
in an area that gets more traffic, cause that makes it easier to get there
id rather meet you somewhere halfway
fk that
takes like an hour to get to ur house
i do that, then you guys come get me
better yet
i gotta go home and walk doggos tho
but maybe yea
citing tumblr doesnt make you less gay ever, is the problem
your case
doesnt help
that
jk
lurk moar next time
ur becoming a real fag
in the context of a real conversation
did you say shitposting
or smth
and i can meet you at the arc light 
you guys go to like amoeba
ok
yea lets go see a movie
you dickass
fuck no
so im not gonna serve you fuckers food
i literally just got pff work tho
hyperion public
except he's able to feel pain
i've gotta say
what do i spend my absolver muneys on
i need ur help
uti
can probably do movie tmrw
i got off at 1:30
nvm
tmrw i work the morning
monday maybe
im going kindred mid
fuck you
and don't have 5
if i hadnt just gotten on the bus
id be down
it's a bigass power fantasy
and most of the time you're not using shit that you like to use
there isn't any progression that isn't player skill
but idk i don't like the ones where you have to build everything from scratch
but you've got spells
it's another roguelike
it's not a hard game
awful movie 
awful
why was arkeo’s ship called DUNG BEETLE SAND
also
like two times better
better than the original song
is
i think that 7 nation army edit
also
he’s in the song normally, right?
that matt sharp one
holy fuck
almost ree'd
i feel like i've put in a good amount of foreshadowing
that isn't spoilery
they're not too too far
that's a lie
especially since there's a time requirement to get good with oxium now
that's a while
i'll just let ya guess
yea i should reduce the damage on the blood uzi's bullets
she just didn't take it
she hasn't used it
Shanta's in a pretty bad position as is rn
i was gonna scale the enemies harder for these next couple fights, but i don't think i will
i won't rush the com itself
when she does that :)
we'll color her
that's fucking brutal
and oxiun that’s either space, ruin, or doom
a space gun
so
open the door fucko
fuck u doin
lol
more like an hour
not 2 mins tbh
hope you’re ready
see you in 2 mins
im on my way there
u up?
boi
A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, a known atheist."Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.”How old is this rock, pinhead?”The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian””Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.Semper Fi. p.s. close the borders
then we def couldn't rp tonight

“in his youth, ______ was the scholar of his people, and the head of his church, and everyone loved him. then an evil force came and destroyed his planet and killed his entire race except _____, who instead they experimented upon, imbuing ______ with shadow magic”
“in his youth, ______ was the scholar of his people, and the head of his church, and everyone loved him. then an evil force came and destroyed his planet and killed his entire race except _____, who instead they experimented upon, imbuing ______ with shadow magic
because his backstory says
*meme
jett literally became a memr
and they played like monkeys
since i had 2 people switch chatacters before the story even started
ass
had an angel/devil thing that was so good that i just had to soft rip it straight into the thing
shitty webcomic with godlike worldbuilding
so just milo and you rly
specifically ones that arent parsa, eric, or jett
and i still wanna run that shit for people
is that my dnd campaign that was a blend of k6bd, and the rp died after one session
what feels bad
bro fuck yea
(ok)
ty man
plan is to hop the rail, get into the pit, and beat the fuck out of some peeps while they bump streaky
still
yea dude
and by that
he knows how to make a set
dude the guy had a hill on stage
just hop the railing
fuck cash
where 90 percent of the crowd is hypebeast bitches shouting i love you kanye over and over
better than a kamye concert by miles though
but sounds about rigjt
thats retarded
so bad
i wanna beat someone up when they blast streaky
id mosh to death grips
big gay
big gay muscles
and ur gay
boris gay
boris gay

an architecture thing?
o cool
and they’re all just a bunch of bools
i know like half of everyone there from when i used to work there like 3 years go
no its not all that bad
and it’s pretty fuckin awkward when he comes in and just hangs out
my dad owns the bar and he’s a fuckin hardass, so everyone makes jokes about how my dad’s gonna catch me slipping or something
the cons are that my dad owns the bar, so working there feels like a bitchy cop out
but thats the pros
very handy skill
slowly learning how to mix drinks
plus
good times
so we closed early and did shots for a bit
today it was dead as fuck
with some solid 8s and 9s
generally 
and the girls dont drop below a 5/10
and the fuckers working there are like not perpetually pissed off
300% more money
its 30% harder work
did i tell you that its 200x better than the fuckin other place?
i did tell you i started working at my dad’s bar, right?
and im going to love every second of it
yes
cause im gonna eat them every day
and im going to get rly fat
has the best shrimp tacos ever
my dad’s place
imma be real

thatd be like me saying
nigga wat
doesnt play games
is game designer
i would have been mad if i bought it full price
half off at least
like uhh
its worth if it goes on sale
but its enough to keep me interested
like absolver’s single player mode is comparable to  a starving alley mutt.
idk i like my games with a little meat on them
but it was literally a boss rush
the gameplay was good
they had no right
and you cant try to copy afro samurai’s aesthetic.
its like shitty afro samurai
the visuals are ass bro
and the bullet hells were ez
the animations are jittery as fuck
eh
so i played it and was right
and i was like this doesnt look like a piece of shit
it was free on psn
a whiiiile ago
ye
y e e t
but i wouldnt be able to start until 12 at least, likely closer to 1
i guess today could be okay
well
sans today
rping im good for any day
like hanging out
i could probs do wednesday too
thats all fine
but like thurs maybe
cant do tuesday
ok
T      U      E     S      D      A      Y     ?

well fuckin start now
this act will take some time
now to head home
im free of work
alright

which
the only thing they suck at is advertisement 
yea they know whats good tbh
lmao
so im ok with it
but they’re not shitty
yea
yikes
and hm2 for 4
hotline miami for 3 bucks

right outside my fkn apartment btw
respectable, but

what's up
cheinei1 hour agoUna's Gaming Channel becuase plants are a renewable resource. You can take apples without killing the tree. You can take leaves of lettuce without killing the entire plant. You cant do that with mammals.The Real Piggy StardustThe Real Piggy Stardust1 hour agoAnimals are a renewable resource, you take 2 pigs and produce up to 8 more pigs. You can then eat those pigs or produce more pigs with them. If you have a herd of 10 wild pigs and only eat 2 of them, the 8 pigs left will reproduce, renewing or increasing the amount of piggy resource.

i haven't started watching it yet
it wasn't no bionicle, okay?

she’s called her roommate “a bit of a slut” before too
but kiskets mentioned her roomate a lot
this is the first time
no

but sippin tea in yo hood
yes
not like xxxtentacion where it's edgey and like ehh
it's edgy and really fuckin good
but it's like
but it's not THIS edgy
like, goblin's edgy
to the point where if you have a decently fast sword deck, you can just destroy anyone no contest.
they’re also the most oppressive moves in the game
yet
and sword moves are really fucking hard to find and learn
that i have like 3 sword moves
my only issuse is
ty guy
soon i will be pro absolver guy and make the newfags cream when i respond to their posts on reddit
and he was like “damb”
i finally came very close to beating him
cause after i randomly matched with him for the fourth time in a month
very good at absolver
i just got added by this dude asylumgod777 who’s
B R U H
(headbang) 
that's fucking awesome
"pff are you serious?"
and kate's whole thing is
is definitely intended to apply to 4chan's fucking incel community
cause it's not gonna apply to everyone
my mom's relationship with anthony
i didn't finish reading it
what's wrong?
it's time
but it doesn't sound wrong
it's from 4chan
i guess it'd just be a storytime
i mean it's not a greentext
i'll ever read
that's the most important question
we'll have to get em next time
what's there?
and check the red playlist?
rq could you do me a solid
OH

before my day has even started
how you gonna get me tilted
so milo's friend just sent him this
but there's nothing separating them
because they're clearly supposed to be seperate
and without it it's awkward
i feel like they're crucial
tf
bongle boy?
did you just call me
but its a jam
its not banger of the year
definitely
i probably saw it while i was in that machine girl phase
ye
idk from where
i feel like i know this
You thought right
i dont, fuck that shit
nor do i have a source of good vaporwave
i havent heard much

i think it might be one dude
have you heard of em?
ok

Indeed it was
rip
when u drink when ur sick
thats what happens
hows ur head my duder?
oi
it's the best i've seen childish dance so far
this shit's pretty litty too
this shit's the banger of the year
i use mp3 cause nothing takes wavs
very fair
or smth
without me having to like quadruple compress that shit
then you can have ur wav format
gimme a sec maboi
suck my zip
nice

rq
wait
pleberinos
100%
sure
i got a zip
youtube succs dicc
you already have tho
lmao
alright
they’re all at least one off
basically everyone
ive done the same with
well that's good
i've gotta make a pirate dnd character
:(
like6 or so prologues in thereones that i've posted already
and i'll re type it out
and it wasn't there
we're going retro i guess
is gone:(
it's
like his goons looked like they could fuck him up in a fight
without the stones he was ez shit
he was swole as fuck with a size advantage
i liked that he wasnt particularly like strong or anything himself
with a nutsack chin
but i didnt mind that he looked essentially like a normal big guy
i just saw that he bought a ranch
the nutsack chin is bad
they fucked up on the lawful evil nice guy villain thing
but not the shit he is
so much
like i like the shit he does
fucking godawful
like i like him a lot as a villain but the flaws in his design are
thanos is in a weird place where
but like as a tool to kill off half the universe the’re alright
i think the stones themselves are pretty stupid
fucking 10/10
comedic moments
in terms of
chris pratt was the star in this movie i think
i hope she is
idk
then you have avengers: depressing fight
go back
he destroyed the gauntlet in the process too so he cant like
thanos realizes he fucked up
they could have him realize that in the next movie
but if the writers continue their big dick trend
i mean its really stupid, motivation wise
yeah
where he changes significantly 
for the next one
so it feels like this movie is essentially thanos’ backstory
i mean theres another thanos movie
i didnt get that
yeah
thats ballsy
its nothing rly compared to the fact that they wrote thanos winning into the script
yes
that was the dumbest shit ive ever seen
yes
easily
was fucking spectacular 
but that ending
i hesitate to call it a good movie
with infinity war
i see what ur sayin
alrighty
feelsbadman
oh ok
How so?
is pretty good
yeah that one
real sor man
you know i did
yes
patience, boolish one
yet
nowhere
ye
i finish late may
 no not yet
cause i cant keep going at 11 bucks an hour
and work at my dad’s
i’m gonna quit working at the cheesesteak place
good man
it is
understandable 
oof
r i p
lmfao
yikes
ok
have they done anything?
rip
who's doing the art?
like it won't be surprising
it'll make sense
yeah that's true
it's either dumb or glorius
that's fucking awesome
yeah :P
you can't send wavs over skype at all rly
i'd
Hey
later tonight
cause im gonna put kate’s out
do you have any progs you plan on shipping out today?
I bet you are
moc making and "bonkles"
just cause
and pacific rim
infinity war
then i’ll see uh
fuck im signing up
yeah
thats insane
and you make back its worth
all you need is see two movies a month
movie pass is nutty
wait
hey guy
that's
they're definitely the type of stories you gotta be there for.
that's fair tho
(ok) 
then its a solid 11
if they bring it back, whoops
iif they do that
0/10
so like
they still got rid of today was a good day
no
skype’s fuckin crazy
r i p

puke’s a classic
then puke i think
talk is 1
so top five
holy fucking shit
holy shit
wtf
actually what he’s saying 
thats
wait
so weird
that one is fucking
tf
thats the new face heirarchy imo
(ttm)
(morningafter)
(puke)
(shivering)
that one’s up there
that cold one is actually good
wait
does that mean
wtf
actually wait
at least im not telling people that videogames are dumb
yea ikr
ana exists
cause
and i actually like it now
i started playing overwatch again
wanna know some dumb shit?
hows it going
ayyyyyyyy bitch
in what
?
wait you fucker that was an auto response 
skype knows what i say
thats how well
i typed it out lul
no
but i didnt press it
one of the responses was “nice meme”
[1524897505] hippothotamus: I am always right

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
in response to
nice meme
skype’s on me
Yeah you right
because its literally that bad
its worth seeing
i almost think
they went to see it?
and this movie is why
i hate pop culture amalgamation stories
going to a restaurant and paying for a plate full of someone’s vomit
that movie is like
ready player one?
did you see the worst movie of the year?
ok
and i wasnt scared by any of the conjuring movies
actually scared me
das a good ass movie
not the woods
the ritual
wait wait
try the woods
you want a good spookerton movie
if
okay
yoinkers
eh
but
i sort of wanted to
no
yeaaaa
rly fuckin good
the writing was
aside from the end
is not good
which
moreso than wes anderson normally rushes endings
like
the end felt rushed
*isle of dogs
isle pf dogs?
good movie of the year
have you seen
good advice
ok
yeah
ok
I am watching it
that one is the best one imo
you havent seen ragnarok?
except for thor ragnarok
neither does my mom
slightly isnt a lot
dont see it
good
would you say it was half as bad as black panther
wait
yea thought it was
it was bad right?
no
tis funk as shit
understandable
no cause thats a headache
um itll mostly be the second scenereo
at least thats what im assuming
which means the current tobin is no longer the main tobin
no whoever she sends back would just be the main guy
?
well if the person fucks up bad enough she could end up in a future where she’s dead
the problem is that it can screw tobin over
yea
you have to break it by doing something differently
its a closed loop yeah
its a closed loop yeah
yes
she uses it on teammates
so she sends people's consciousness backwards
tobin's a support through and through
that's it
maybe 4.5
this tobin one’s about a 4
sounds good i dont think i can make it today either
rip
Yes it did
Yes it did
It did.
But it did
it did
im gonna work on the tobin
now
transitory shouldn't exist
i'd use transient
not that i'd ever use transitory
i don't mean like
which means there's a lot of words that. i can't use
but im basically editing a children's book
and that shit’s hard as hell
 im working on this editing project for my mom’s friend dana
its good lmao
Just woke up
nice
hows ur game design classes btw
"a fucking massive awesome kick-ass piece of shit"
"a fucking massive awesome kick-ass piece of shit
i don't have to keep up
is not a happy one
mfw i now have to somehow keep up with that big dick loop prologue
honestly
by skype
those were the options for auto response 
i dont know where its pulling its responses from
only one of those is current
indeed we do, yes we do, that we do
more than enough for a batshit crazy rpg or something, someday
good shit
and the ahmkara hunt
and the agean law
and my boy razrez
with good guy amino-as
rp lore is still best lore
 cool shit
it started wherever aegean vapor is from, aegea?
it started wherever aegean vapor is from, aegea
auto response sucks dick
It did not
Yeah you should have
right?
im beginning to assume that the pirate lordship didnt begin on moloko
with all this new pirate info
so
and i’ll say that shit happened offscreen
i’ll assume veruvi isnt retarded enough to not read the guidebook, or at least “how to pirate lord: for dummies”
but its not a big thing
so one would assume the agean vapor treats eterny like dukes and duchesses 
and on a scale of 1-10 how respected are the eterny
or is it like a title
so are all the eterny one race?
if a pirate lord built a brand new ship
no like
?
where would the eterny be on a brand new ship
also
agean law
the agean vapor
so
r i p
lmao auto answer
Yeah me too
yoinks
but now ma bois acting out of fear, and thats always interesting
he shows a lot of emotion, but its all just been shades of anger so far
thats not true
or maybe the change was around the vica attack, but its only now becoming apparent
not to say that he wasnt doing anything, but he hadn’t changed, at least in any big ways until now
loop’s got a little more character now that he’s like moving more
but solid prologue
 because those scene/time changes were a bitch at first
it could definitely use some actual non-skype level formatting though
what an oofer that one was
ez
but that looks like the longest solo
im sure we’ve got some long ass duo ones
im sure we’ve got some long ass single ones
wtf
99+ messages
read it
i need to
nice
how's it going?
but for some reason parsa thinks it'd be lod--gear
im taking dogs for walk
o
is doc made
it's over
y o o o o o o
Quite.
it's just as weird she'd be pink
i don't see it on my end
have some dank shit
make plays, if you’re a villain
or
completely random so the only thing you can do is fuck around, troll, wait for villains to make plays
all any is the shit
most likely
so
i started playing town of salem again
probably
and she's got no eyebrows and a flat nose
and they're not that fat
she's got 4 of the tentacle things
that's about it
so he's just gotta screw in a new pair
there isn't an automatic reloading mechanism
i mean the dude doesn't just keep a bunch of spares on him
he's more for grappling and tanking hits
he's got spiked knuckles
he's a big metal can
that's made out of two rails of electromagnets
that'd be a bad idea
if she started hitting things with it in sniper mode, it'd break
it's also a sniper rifle
it's like one of those
you know grievous's shitty droid guards from revenge of the sith?
it's like
peridotto's a chick with a stick
she's a demolitions agent
a.... ranch....
i think that's it
he's also got pull and psy grip
he's got a few
(bhangra)
(footballfail)
(gran)
(morningafter)
(puke)
There are dozens of us!
There's dozens of us!
Literally dozens!
I as well.
same
That's what she said
That's what she said
not close to done
im
nice
why is auto answer so bitchy all the time
You tell me
yo
yeah they're the same
it's just processed differently
and that shit wasn't cgi
there's a stunt from a few scenes before this
jackie chan's never been much of a cgi guy
i think that might've just been him
cause if so im pretty sure that's just his weird ass face
but the movie's from 1994
i didn't tell you
i wouldn't have known if i hadn't been told
the person on the cover isn't him
yeah that'd be all over mu
a bare ass isn't it
but that one's the best imo
fuck me i've gotta go for distan
UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
kate's probably better in that regard
autofill doesn't hesitate to clap back
but in game it's solid as fuck
absolver's soundtrack
that's cool
he got one round where i didnt 3/0 him
that was brutal
omg
for so long
fighting this dude
iive been
oh ok
then i’ll be hype
so whenever it drops
but i havent been following it
i am
idk what niggas on the moon is

mom came to la for suprise road trip over spring break
i have not had any reception for a while
hello
idk
ok
nice
same
i don't see the playlist for obstacle btw
they'll probably be done whenever the rp ends
and then if a song ever comes along and im like "oh shit that's kate, or kisket, or tracy or whatever i'll add it and go over it again, maybe take something that doesn't really belong as much out
but i've been playing tracy's more, recently
i used to play kisket's a lot
yea it's still soft machine
it's not saying the playlist
you haven't seen mine
cause you can barely understand them
but you wouldnt even know
the lyrics are fucking excellent too
bro its so good
is the best song i’ve heard in the past month and a half
by perfect pussy

aight
went ahead and changed the second half on the fly
i thought u were dead asleep :/
i didnt get any of those
i just dont have that obsessive/compulsive personality
pfft me? no
hah, no definitely not
tbh im only talking about absolver to give credence to that “i think you have an obsession” comment
but i will vehemently deny that if you ever ask
tbh im only talking about absolver to give credence to that “i think you have ab obsession” comment
good luck with c l a s s

it's a godawful idea
o that's not to baaaad
that'd be ridiculous
doesn't fit the mood of what im going for at all
imma listen to absolver's soundtrack
this is basically just tracy's romantic life
they're normally like more spainish south american than mexican
a date rape sim &gt;.&gt;
that wouldn't be a dating sim
i couldn't see a neon one
there'd need to be like
it'd be fucking hilarious
what's good my guy?
it's
if your even up then ._.
feels fuckin bad
in like 3 hours
probably
i talk to u later mate
breaks over
anyway
stupid good
so fun
but it makes the grinding
is that its basically just a grindfest
what’s stupid
ive said all this shit already
w’e
idk
its sorta like uh
needed to pull off your shit
without having ludicrous strings of inputs
mechanically its so fucking complex
oh its fuckin awesome
take that with a grain of salt
so like
who’s not good at fighting games
but this is coming from a dude
best fighting game imo
now that theyve fixed a lot of bugs
absolver
anyway yea
hype
o
lmao
which i like tbh
its just aesthetics
ww hd or smth
on par with uh
its a good looking game but technically the graphics are like
its crisp
that shit fresh af
but now
cause i got the big toaster
it looked like hot smelly garbage before
o ye
and whooping mad ass
being like level 30 no doritos
it is fuckin fun
that said
and it feels so bad
i gotta grind them all up again
but i have no moves
cause its so good in 60 fps
i wanna kms

cause it was like 7 bucks
i got absolver on the ps4
a few days ago

is much easier to get at since it's a webcomic
wheras radical republicans and radical islam and shit feels like it's far away
i wouldn't be surprised if i went and got an mri
urself?
nm
they're rly good
:(
that's like
it's os good
i hav'ent'seen that aojngesul
it's pretty amazing
it's a top tier meme
that's big money
what's the portfolio for
that's pretty cool
i've got like
nice
“lol
howd the pixel prototype project go?
anyway tho
ye
i don't remember the dudes
ye that's good
but she's basically memorizing and playing the song on stage there
its not like she's using some new music software
whereas in a lot of cases it's only like partially active
these are the best comments i've seen on a video in a long while
AAAAAA
if that's a problem, lol
there's actual like technical skill going into the performing aspect of the song
from tracy's perspective
just tracy's power
that's
cause she's fucking crazy
what you up to my guy?
and work has ended
how goes it?
i hit you with the 5am your time
yooooooo
and climb these fkn stairs
as soon as i get back home
im gonna do one
d
feelsbaf
ye
v good moment
tell herself off as well
and theres a sense that she’s trying to like
she goes into too much detail about it
vica’s wording is rly good
in that part in particular 
anyway
ye
dude voice
ur fuckin
and
making everyone read a role yes
yea
i hear jennah from the sakura shit
every time i see that word baka
its bad
yeah
i should have made mras a tsundere
lol
then itd be cheesy
“kiss me. b-baka.”
“do what?”
if you had said “dont ever do that again.” 
it wasnt
im jk
that was cheesy af
nope
but that vica prologue is rly fuckin good
i dont think i said it earlier
wb u?
but yea
nope
at work
sup my dude
and one of them talks, to red in a prologue, though i don't confirm who
there's only oryx so far
what'd u think of my shitty prologue
&gt;:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
&gt;:\
hell yea
whasdup w/ u?
yea
shit-tier
 silber
it felt fucking great
tried to int
i just hard carried a whiny bitch draven tho
ranked too
and playing league of legends alone
im pulling a full retard
 o yea?
"we [insert verb]" cult thing
but they don't
yea i wasn't comparing that aspect
he's purring now
like it's been a very bad girl?
and i can't stop
but i've gotta steal all the oxygen
she loves us is big gay
here's my counter argument to that
they're not good
if that album wasn't so cringey in the lyrics department i'd give it like an 8
that's banger of the year there
can't even hear what he's saying anyway
cause it doesn't sound like vocals at all
idk if it's as much of a jam as v:d:c tho
i wasn't sure about leaves turn inside you tbh
they weren't the BEST during their time either
it seems like it's mostly 30-40 years
that's
but didn't ever complete
it's not what i wanted.
it's good
i hadn't actually looked at it
it's so good
suddenly it's just top of google
that's easily the best part
and there isn't a ton of variation until like
it's a little too hard tho
it's a
and even then i doubt that'd be longer than three days
tbh i don't have any
you didn't say no time skips
with a saloon and everything
it's
we're having a 6 year time skip
yea man
its a good time im p sure
and barking at the door when nothing’s there
like beating the shit out of buddy
up to doggo things
she’s doin well
now im fuckin tryna get cleo to eat
I was walking dogs
Sup guy
Talking about 90
I thought you were
That’s all 3
Com 100?
Wait
machine girl is the jam
Rly
&gt; : ?
&gt;: (
&gt;:(
wednesday's cool
hail mary that bitch into the prism thing
lets
ok
how good is ara's aim
maybe ask it it's name?
say like "hey"
she's holding it so i guess explore the cave.
that'll be
she's in a pointy floor cave
lmao
yes
k
walking doggos but i’ll try
im
good u?
if you search for mermix mermix in the rp chat you'll probably find a big hint into what one of my upcoming coms will be about
i can't remember
: ^)
:)
it rly doesn't need more
yeah that's definitely true
i'll just
i didn't want to get all political and do anything as cool as the actual rp
you're a party of archaeologists, who run into ruins and kill shit and try to find shit to sell
so it's
eric isn't the problem
can't stop thinking about it
but i tried to like tone down on some of the shit we've already made
(noworries) 
(ok) 
though theres been some huge formatting problems lol
writing them out beforehand tho
thats also a part of like
twas good
where you just learn techniques to break down your superficial “writing voice” and make it more real
this method writing class
i finished that good ass class yesterday
i said it so it's true
you secretly believe the world is flat and you're trying to sway me to your evil cause
that's how a flat earther would respond to that statement
but they're not arguing with someone who's logical enough to like
so like i can't rly say one way or the other
i don't know what they believe though
flat earthers are wrong cause they're retarded
at least not from my perspective on what flat earther's believe
what's this?
pce
this one is espresso depresso
fucc i gotta get on that
been a little while since theres been a reindeer effigy
also its
ok hit me
v's got a ton of mars and sirie prologues
in the sense that she's been in the most
i actually think i've technically done the most for veruvi
i just said who it's for
haven't finished
and cause he doesn't have like a country of distance between himself and them
milo only rly talks to them cause he's been doing it for so long
but that's it
he's a hunk of shit
and it's surprisingly making him less of a pain in the ass
milo's got one
that's fuckin awesome
you're drunk bird moses
holy shit you're moses
cause you're a monk right?
you don't like use weapons
or if you fudge a roll so a pc who's asked to die can die
it's situational
no it's not
i think it's very very dependent on circunstance
dm's do tho apparently
yeah it'd be hard for a big group
we're definitely not running mechanics rn
that it's at a good enough point to be campaignable
compared to liking skrillex he's like royalty
if he didn't give a shit he would have been like ey this game blah blah
that's how you know he wants you to play it
and you're in the "make your own shit" section?
is this one for bennet's class?
what the fuck how am i supposed to figure that out????
if i lived in austin texas where the dev team is i think it’d have been easier
mhm
idk
and it seems like they really dont know either so like
im editing a blog, a book and maybe another, and the dialogue for that game still though i dont know how much longer i can do that cause i still cant tell what the direction behind it is
yea
im mostly worried about a few other editing projects
a few but they’re not too huge
those shits are annoying
you mean those logic problems?
yikes
you have a ton of projects for them?
yea
dam
frankly its stressful as fuck and very tilting
im not tellin you to do it tho
which doesnt make it less long
its 3 hour and a half videos
and this one is the worst
and i ended up just going through the bad movies
i got here by watching black panther shit
i wouldnt have if i wasnt currently watching the thing i linked you
yea i signed that shit too lmao
there is one for that, actually
yeah ik
since daisy ridley is enamored with rey for some reason
the only issue i could see with it is that mark hamill is probably the only actor who would understand why the movie was shit in the first place
and disney doesnt even have to take the blame. Rian Johnson wrote the movie and directed it. if anything the movie was entirely his fault
i honestly dont see why its a bad idea
they could go back on it, remake it, and release an actually acceptable movie, and make all that shitty money over again
just because it grossed well doesnt mean its good. it grossed well because it was shitty and that caused a lot of controversy
i.e. bitchmade
but thats like not voting because you dont think its effective
well yea
did you read what the petition is for?
wait
why’s it pointless?
like it doesn’t matter but i dont see why that means you cant want better things
and the movie was remade to be better
but it would be extra cool if it was removed
no
sign the petition C:
ye
this movie makes the prequels look like the godfather trilogy
thats what i felt upon watching it, basically. star wars doesnt deserve a movie this bad
the problem is both with the movie being bad and that its barely star wars. It was written and directed by rian for the sole purpose of getting to 6 or so cool scenes that would make a bunch of money in the box offices
unacceptable
like luke’s character. that shit looks like it scarred mark hamill
theres a good chunk about the quality of the movie but a lot more about the writing and how it ignores or shuts down a whole litany of parts of star wars, from plot points that were left in episode 6 and 7 to parts of its universe like Y wings being the go-to bomber class ships. And instead of using the material it was based on it superimposes facts with its own magical bullshit that mostly ends up feeling like a mass of cop out techniques
but the whole thing is nearly 5 hours and i doubt you have the time for that rn
that critique i linked would probably change your mind
but i get where you’re coming from
i disagree on that
and i mean yeah nobody's entitled to it. but like nobody's entitled to take an existing franchise and fuck it as royally as rian johnson did
but whats the point in signing a petition to say you’re dissatisfied? i dont see the reason for that. if you’re gonna voice your opinion its because you want to see some sort of change. The problem with Episode 8 isnt just that its a bad movie, but that it annihilated luke’s character without giving a solid explanation, on top of it being a ridiculously bad movie with more holes than a used sponge


cause it's not
it's not like it's unfounded
if they did they'd have huge balls
that's not true at all
idk why
odd
am i usually online around 8:45?
?
oh nice
that's what the hype is about
its literally just cause it's a movie about black people
i've seen it twice
could call it the 5 year-er
lol
cause i still dont have one
did you figure out a title?
"nibba"
?
what about noah and that girl
gj teague
tf does that mean?
man mode?
ok gotta jet
:0
i see
maybe?
i thought so
wait isnt alex the vine dude?
i know them all sabe for derek and alex
the same ppl from last time?
who’s in it?
yea i figured
yea thats true lmao
its awkward af
i’ve read too many stories
woo her in game
make sure nobody else in the group starts trying to like
dope
lol
i see
and in real life?
are you and julia a couple in your campaign
julia’s a part of it right?
oi in your dnd group
ripperino
it has been pretty good
you rly got slammed
nice
wassup?
i am on break at work rn
yo
for sure man take your time
yikes
kk
im hype
yea
yea
lol
but now its obvious
:/ well sure
so im thinking we’re in the buildup phase to the weight
cause like the previous com was only half a second while the other was a release of some albiet big, already known info.
im thinking the latter
i’m not quite sure now if its in high gear or at a relatively slower build up point
ya just feel bad for her
pummeling on shanta
yours has been consistently just
ye C:
slow or whatever, thats why
yea well if you wondered why my story’s been so uh
lmfao
we’re almost at the second arc of my rp as a whole
im hype
but yo
but only in the sense that im waiting for the moment that she and condor blue get placed on the same battlefield 
and mav maybe?
she’s essential to my heart
porcea
aside from like
yea nobody of my gp people are essential
make sasha actually useful
it might be good
es cool
2 of my lords are non-combat right?
you know that like
ok
yikes!
hell ya
o
fuq sorry
rip in pepe ronis
not good
of mine at least
its funny, i’ve noticed my favorite pirates have a definite hierarchy in how they’re represented in prologues
cool name cool dude
i guess is
he was one of the cooler ones
glad to see whorrapath rolled well
nice prog
what is he again? fighter?
thats hype
like what?
gotten up to any shenanigans 
hows ur dnd going?
fri works
lol
bruh
yea i can do sat
fuck ur shit we’re doing thurs
o cool
nope i have no idea who that is
p tiring cause work was busy af
but yea it was
fuck yeaaa
not over yet
but it's just sitting there in the rp for some reason
[2/12/2018 10:49:35 PM] no cars go: The Ckivogue puts him in handcuffs, and puts a shock collar around his neck. If he goes over four feet away from the Ckivogue, he will receive a very powerful shock.&lt;&lt;&lt;
im at the it's pretty good stage
i didnt even realize, but its a pretty good sad days valentines day special
ty again
ty guy
one of my favorite things about music
man percussion is slowly becoming like
(wait)
how tf u know?
but im hype now
i havent heard it yet
im partial to in love with a magician
if i dont have sex by the end of the week km g g g g going to die
i’ve gotta listen to girl o clock man
i dont have time for weeb shit rn
the fuck
kkb?
?
cause its done
but when i get there i’ll post it in there
im not home rn
anyway
my skype may have flipped out
yea
then i thought you deleted it and moved it
cause it showed up in a group chat with eric and milo and all those cucks first
it was weird tho
its on my comp
the message
its not on my phone
you put something about the ckivogue into the regular rp
it was last night
w0t
im waiting for you to finish that ckivogue one
i didn't realize this until just now
jesus christ he's insane
i really don't like that.
cause kendrick doesn't deserve this on his name
you know what's terrible?
oi do you know when boiled chicken is done cooking?
rip u lmao
wtf
nope
i was surprised
its very different lol
no i listened to another song briefly
its doable
not like tago mago
its alittle off putting i’ll say that
i’ll listen to it all at some point
perfectly delivered
girl o clock is my favorite fucking song rn
fuck u
also
i will remember that
k
but there's no reason for reporters to try to go and see uti
it has to do with the prologue i'm writing currently
which might actually not be a good comparison cause you're pretty good at planning them
it's sort of like the difference between planning and running commissions
i guess i'm just too used to pressing enter every three seconds
i'm actually not sure if it's easier to do prologues in chat or prewrite them.
i didn't get very many details
so i don't think that's applicable
you're very right
they have a playable build that's only in canada
i've barely had a look at it
that's important.
it's at least got big headers for each section.
it's not the prettiest thing tho, i could have done more in that direction
that's rather interesting
tbh i'm still not sure how much i needed to give them
i wasn't supposed to send anything to you
at least that's what i understand they wanted
and then they're coming up with the meat and the details afterward
at this point they basically wanted a basic reason for the character to be doing what they're doing
but it's worth bringing up cause like if they do go with it
k
my name will never be on anything that has that group of words arranged anywhere in it's contents
there's nothing in the fucking world that will make me keep that name
"Ah! Welcome to the Forest of Fortune! Gale the Wizard, at your service! I'm glad you're here! With your help, we will create a realm full of castles, towers, and even roller coasters!But first, every great kingdom begins with a village, and every village begins with a Great Hall. Let's rebuild the old one!Construct more buildings by completing challenges. "
it's about as simple as it gets: what they have is literally: collect currency.
it's about as simple as it gets: what they have is literally, collect currency.
i mean it's a simple game
i have a doc full of dialogue that i'm gonna replace and that's it really
i've told you everything that i know really
if it wasn't for her i'd have created someone else
i honestly dont think it'd be very interesting without someone to interact with anyway
the only requirement is that it's a city slot game
the story doesn't matter as long as the execution is good
they're hiring me to write whatever story
they're more like team leads or company execs
they don't have anyone else to do that
so i'm giving them something
most of these city games don't even have a narrative
cause i don't trust those people to do it
i'll be writing the dialogue
that's their problem
i feel like that's a lawsuit waiting to happen
and i don't know how im gonna change that
and she'd be like the guide or whatever
it's fantasy
there isn't really any reason to be getting all that gold, and that's my job
it's a city building game mixed with slots
ye
cause some of the songs get samey pretty quickly
i reccommend using the timestamps
its like what you’d get if death grips had severe adhd and were japanese
tbh its barely idm
fuck everything else
but this is the best idm
it starts and ends a liiiitle weeby
here
nice
jesus christ that was tough
i was sitting on the red playlist for a year and a half
when we get there
eventually
not yet
very different from the others
90% idm
ive got a character playlist thats
but yea
yep
ok
o
is not that good
liking 3 or 4 songs out of like 50
gabber is my jam
aphex twin sucks massive dong
but more gabbertrap and grindy idm
i like idm
ic
thats fair
i see
when did this happen
idm
lol
savage intolerance
there is one nails song that fits neon imo
neon’s playlist is updated
its k tho
ye feels bad
like fuckin run to my toilet and hurl any minute now
(puke)
iholy shit im feeling sick af tho
not yet
that will be corrected posthaste
and how neon’s playlist is missing thatshit
i just got reminded of nails
there u go
(noworries)
i dont see how that can come off as a roast unless you bring up that you think of it as one
good idea
mbmb
whoops
but they don't make very many games themselves anymore
late early maybe
this is them
bro
yeah
my mom and the lady who’s blog I edit both know this woman who’s like a director in a game publishing company. and they put in a good word for me
that question didnt load for me
wtf
o
it's a town building slot game hybrid
unless it's not
it'll be dope
im not
cause
well good
then it might take a while
you suck at combat
unless like
we should be able to finish next week
nice
kk
:/
at 5:30
k
crazy though
and the gameplay is solid as fuck too
it's like it takes a hammer and goes straight for the feels
that richard pryor fucked marlin brando?
yeah
there's nothing wrong with that
that's good
too bad nobody's gonna read it
he's just right though
oh sick
its like better tron
its very good
the 2 player one?
which one?
i bet
game designers talking about their famous games
the closest is probably getting over it
fuckin sakura suicide doesnt even come close tho
eventually 
you’ll just have to try it
i wont say why
pyre is the most emotional game of 2017
(monkey) 
i'll admit it's dank
it's ar-khan, right?
haven't
does vica's message show up before maws on your screen?
WHY DIDN'T I KNOW
I'M
from like a deeper place i guess
techniques to practice writing deeper
its like
uh
cause it's all just
and jack grapes is like "nananana, all that? that's bullshit, we're gonna focus on the actual writing."
that generally isn't the writing
it's
didn't see that
how's julia?
i see
i see
rip
o
do you flip the food?
rip
thats dope
lmao wat
weird that a game design course gives you no time to play games
: (
shitballsfuck the art is incredible
i bought pyre and am just starting it
hows it going
ye
and how its success is physically painful to me
and the dude was so happy about it that i couldnt tell him how appalling the concept of that book is
customer service reccommended ready player one
nvm
cause ive read The Left Hand of Darkness 6 times in a row now and i need something else
im gonna go to customer service and get someone to help me find something
i feel like i might be turning into an asshole 
12 interesting sounding books
*of
im in barnes and noble having a mental breakdown cause i just read the first pages if 12 books and they’re all dogshit
holy fuckin shit
there's another update coming soon
and then it'll be done
i didn't see that shit
yea but they don't know that
stacked as fuck bro?
i suggest we popcorn it
in the intrest of getting this prologue over with
oh
i’ll check it out today
nice
wat
im getting pretty close to 100% in hollow knight
well now that you know all the jumps you could probably breeze through that motherfucker
ic
oooo
were you trying to speedrun it?
2 hours and 50 minutes, right?
go faster
nice
i had to go to the store
sorry about that
k
lmao
who needs to show up for a new lord being announced or whatever?
so
o
ok

Je'aime

we'll do
she's working all sunday
cause she doesn't have any other days
don't lose it
:(
oh ok

:O
if that wasn't clear
if mars ever became president of monad, that'd be his first order
re's fine
and i'll choose which one of mine
you'll see pretty soon C:
goddamn that shit's hardore
zacht's powers
but that's so extra
&gt;.&gt;
it's cause she's made out of matter n shit
it's not she counts as an object because she's female
but im assuming that means ara-chro's powers use a shitton, right?
nor ariso's tbh
i don't know what osira's powers do
i've done it before
i don't know what the studio version sounds like tho
yea it's pretty good
wait what's solid?
spotify doesn't have a not live version tho
ok i'll just leave it after
:|
but techincally she's not red there yet.
i just don't quite know where it'll fit
this is just another nail in the coffin for my ongoing "pretty much all rappers are massive fucking idiots" theory
it's tough
yea that's understandable
&gt;.&gt;
that doesn't look free af
what the fuck
dont call them that
please
dumplings?
as in
dumps
five guys is an ordeal
:////
and i’ve already eaten
and she just got back to me

on death’s door
and now im at the hospital

and you get -2 to those
performance checks are a charisma roll
lap steel guitar tho?
and you're a bird
like do you just break faces because they're not being calm and peaceful?

im just messing
phantom thread? more like mulholland drive amirite?
hell yea another movie to add to the never watch cause it’ll tilt the fuck outta uti list
it's public now
this one determines what i was gonna name it
after this prologue actually i can give you the sirie playlist
nice
plus i listen to fruitcake and cookies a lot as a sirie song
those are awesome
yea dude

Luv:Pro:Avid

i still havent been able to listen to  the whole thing in one go
i’ll tell you later
yea its impossible to tell

i fell asleep on the couch :///
mb
:(
yea
any time between probably 1 and 5:30
design wise i feel like they got that shit right
there's this game pyre
and the scene where the dude enters the escape pod and tells her to use the landing jets
and i did like the message
but it was fucking awesome
which is what i didnt like
and tries to remain grounded in real life physics
but its not as batshit crazy as mad max
and it becomes a little unbelievable
she shoulda died like 20 times
where like
it has the mad max thing though
the movie is crazy and the sound design is great
i dont hate it
New Faces 2? or followup on Neon's com
this is excellent
getting snacks and turning on my comp
i was
now yes
you know that right?
beat for beat
clockwork orange
this is fucking
omg he did
im sorry i’ll never be able to take alex seriously again
this prologue
uti
dont we?
k
i can maybe make that work
on thursday?
i think it sums up why i like that game
dunkey made a gang beasts video
i cant send shit over skype again for some reason
i guess we'll only count maw's actual power
V's dad was confirmed ruin
and don't you have a ruin boy?
but i haven't decided on an oxium for liz :O
i don't have any more hope characters
idk why i was thinking i'd need to like, sus out who we've alredy counted.
unless your plan is to just delete what's there and re-count
it definitely won't kill anyone in one hit though, aside from like, trash mobs.
i like that tobin's video camera is now an item
yeah he's doing alright comparatively.
didn't
that elesa didn't remember
that elesa doesn't remember
tracy's depth comes from deep internal pain and turmoil
and to stop myself from just throwing everything into one person, so i wouldn't have the issue of everyone with the same power feeling like a shittier version of that one dude
the whole point is that it's non-specific
but they're not on that part of the list
that's what the slashes are for
how'd you decide how that shit works?
i wasn't trying to hide it
and the slashes separate different abilities or different uses of abilities
the dashes are mixed descriptors of a certain power they might have
but like i remember all the specific nuances of each person’s oxium. and i think it’s mostly cause this
i totally forgot about this shit
key:
offensive: combat oriented powers that are meant to harm others
defensive: combat oriented powers meant to protect and augment the user and/or allies.
utility: non-combat oriented powers meant to aid the user in various, often indirect, ways.
aggressive: powers are consciously directed onto others and self.
passive: powers are either unconsciously controlled or always active, acting on self, the environment, and sometimes others.
passive-aggressive: reactionary powers that either act indirectly, or require certain conditions to be met.
dead, lol: who cares anymore lmao
wtf
there’s even a key for the phrases
its like some military categorization system
wtf
i went and did this shit for like over half the characters
These are just the ones i can show you rn
• Veruvi - Ruin offensive passive-aggressive/utility 
• Zaza - Triumph defensive-passive
• Mars - Glass (Hounds) utility/defensive-passive

this shit goes on and on

• Efrideet - Void utility/offensive-aggressive
• Jaren - Space defensive-passive/utility
and i found this list i made a year and a half ago
so i start goin through them
*2 nights ago
and my notes are open from last night
i fiddle with it
and like a normal bool
but i stop to check my phone
mostly just fixing mistakes that i have to fix before i can actually move forward
so ive beed drawing all night
ok
but you'll never guess.
you have all the information you need to know who's gonna be in it
no it wasn't mine either
yea i hadn't seen those responses before
That was gonna be a prologue, but since it now needs to be made apparent, I'm doing it in the rp.
except tmrw we’ll have to start at 1
sure
and he’s amazing
it was bound to happen
ye
so
that’ll tie into setting up for 70
i just came up with a better idea on the fly
fuck that
naw
but i know what i need to happen
no
do i have anything planned?
good shit
ok
starting at 11
you mean
if by rp
i can
uh
*face
i dont like that fave
:?
what were you saying?
wbu?
i was gonna say that Threads will always have to do with someone getting better with their oxium, but it wont always be mars
lmaoooo
oh
that'll feel shitty
i don't wanna start using it for an hour and a half
i haven't used it yet
and this is a 6 pound onyon i'm tellin you
i got it cause it made me think onyon.
it's some Hunion thing?
it's good
that's basically the same argument you're making tho
so if you're setting up a surround sound thing with speakers all over the room
there shouldn't be a difference.
but if it's stereo, then it's just split evenly, right?
what's the difference?
too bad they didn't have to be kind
that one's a stretch
Clothes that aren't from TJ Max are novelty too
but there's nothing wrong with novelty
ic
so is Tzez shut out?
lmao good
ye
we can still do that
stepping into the uber
you asked as i was
a little over 30 mins
im omw rn
ye
and then walk dogs before i go
cause i still need to get ready n shit
i probably wont be able to leave for another hour and a half 
well
im almost done :(
finishing weapons for the characters I've statted out so far.
&gt;: O
&gt;:O
D: &lt;
D:&lt;
then kisket's charisma has def gone up
that's weird enough
i think i'm actually really not ok with that shit.
they're still 19
where's the outline?
that shit don't work
it's k
:O
the first time i'd ever heard you say "fag"
it's not good
and i think it's mostly cause im living with my aunt
we've been friends for ever you're basically black
i've got like
and say "fuckin get on with it."
but we didn't use it
i just didn't change much of the characters themselves
it's sort of why i have so many characters with swords n shit
i don't even know how we talked back then
the retro shit woulda been on that old one too :(
and the first time i switched, I didn't realize you could transfer chat history
i've gone through 3 computers during this rp
yea i couldn't do that cause
but i don't have them on this computer
and the bigass blocks aren't too bad
it's like very usable
mine isn't very laggy at all
won't install just yet
it's trash
cause if thats the case, Maw is fucked
villians included?
are we statting everyone on there?
k
i could also try to normalize it once we get into team 3 coms
cause shape shifting
the most sub stats that i’ll dole out will probably be to Neon
9 or 10
uh
and then like add points for how they're influenced 1 by 1
it's not
it's very important
kisket's birthday
i just don't remember which.
cause in the beginning shanta says she's 25 right?
we're character creation genius
HOLY SHIT that's actually genius
but isn't actually necessary
"knockback" "kick" "recoil"
which would then be recuperated by your aim stat and however your stats line up with the gun's
the higher it's accuracy number is
or like the more recoil it'd have
so the faster a gun's rate of fire
that's fuckin genius
i dont know how the accuracy numbers would work but i scaled them down to be proportional to a 20 roll
Halcon F08 repeater rifle: 8 shots per turn, accuracy - 8 (Str)

Charging energy gun: 1 shot per turn (charge), Charge time - 1 action, accuracy 6 (Int)

Hotshot Handgun: 3 shots per turn, accuracy - 7 Dex

Shock Hammer: 1 hit per turn, range 2 units accuracy 5 (Str)

Lil’ Minigun: 4-20 shots per turn (scales based on number of turns used in a row +4 shots per turn), accuracy - 3 (Con)
or the accuracy that im thinking of
here are some examples of weapons that im thinking of
oi
okok cya
and depending on the weapon you’re holding, that stat is decided by either str, int, wis, con, dex, cha, ect
thats what i mean, you have your base aim in the sub stats
aim as its own stat skews the stat power level, where aim is like, a lot more important than everything else
and it means that neon or qitara cant run up and grab a rocket launcher and get a headshot outta nowhere
i liked the idea of aiming mortars wits int checks
aw
rest in peace
mamus tho
let us finish this com
and yes
k
but yes
im not sure
yes
kk
ok
or by a bunch of things?
like is aim only adjusted by strength?
a gatling gun and a throwing knife are used very differently
cause like
and so after the accuracy value we say whatever stat the aim is adjusted by?
to accuracy
so out of range theres just a penalty
thats def more realistic
yea sure
far less realistic than what we were doing
is what i mean
and as long as something is within the weapon’s range it’s the same roll to hit
where distance isnt a factor
we could also take the dnd route
we just say how many units away enemies are when fights break out
ic
with 20 its much easier to be clearer on the degrees of a miss or a hit
its too complicated
why
but like
83s or 27s
sometimes we counted like
cause like
20
hmmm
oh ok
be decided by strength
endurance can be one of the sub stats
yea for sure
thats why its best of 3 or best of 5
yes
id say itd be more of a best of three thing tho
ye
thats close tho
the 15
kinda need to tune it a little better
it’s sort of weird in practice tho
ye
the characters roll against each other’s strength
i have any planned chase sequences
not that
high strength means you can run longer or something
we could also use strength as like an advantage in chases
but because physicality is so broad it works
strength is hard
and str can be used for things like pushing or barehanded combat
ye
other than that it’s good
or the specific weapon
based on the type of weapon you’re using
i was thinking more along the lines of aiming scales with either str, dex, or int
ic
kk
i think the aiming stat should be based on the weapon
will find out then
im going out to lunch in a sec
im not too sure yet
i feel
i woke up at 8:30 too
k
k
how's it going?
he'll probably need a buff
i haven't used it for a while either
this is just so you don't have to look for it
if you use docs for homework you're pretty fucked tho
hope you don't mind if i just copy it
we're just gonna do it the way we already have it
ay so we're keeping all the same stats?
if we don't get to C10
depending on the comissions we're on
i didn't say how much
that'll be cool
we're close to a prologue where mars gets better with his oxium though
it's a solid 50/50
if it's 3 or higher it works as intended, lower it doesn't
we don't roll dex ever too,
and it'd be nice if you had some more chances to sus that shit out
and having characters get hurt is very good for authenticity
because we give a fuck about authenticity
but im not
we’re using hp
then i’d say no fuck you.
if i were worried that you or i’d try to be all, “Yea he takes the laser cannon to the face but he lives cause he’s super tough
and we’re not cunts
its just the two of us
and we need more rolling in general
it was good to bring back rolling for conversations
especially since we still have the stats
in very down to make character sheets
k
i don't know a meter off the top of my head
we'll do feet
it's my new weekly source of cancer
why aren't people talking about that shit?
then anakin looks like he's 20 but also edgy and emo, and padme looks like she's 24-26
then they both look like they're 20
anakin's maybe 12 or 13 lookin like he's 7
15 lookin like she's 20
anakin's growth in proportion to padme throughout the prequels
you're just wrong
featured "I killed them, all of them, like animals."
"do it"
but he doesn't care about the complete package
it's not saying he doesn't care about star wars
i don't think there's ever been a ship that's tracked without there first being a shot of a tracker being fired or thrown onto it first.
but there's always been visual confirmation that there was a tracker planted on the tracked ship
it's not
that's absolutely unprecedented
he literally couldn't even decide on a way to make that shit happen
snoke's ship getting blasted by the hyperspeed ship
here's literally how it was written
so he's actually just a bool
dark as fucc
*that
jesus thar game was so good
kotor?
fuck
star wars is at its best when its dark
i mean
they didnt want their label on a darker movie
yeah
so they dont need to worry
marvel is just based off comic books
cause they cant make original ideas?
you should
did not need to be so long
which could have reeeeaaally been 5 minutes
that movie was great up until the 15 minute final battle
and thor ragnarok was fuckin
with the new spider man
marvel is getting out of the funk
ye
just on a smaller scale
and with marvel
same problem with dc movies
and then the story is grafted on cause it needs to be there
made big to make money
wheras these movies are like
but they’re made big to take that story and make money
i mean a bunch of movies are made out of the want to create a story
no i get you
lul truuuueeee
rogue one was good
im actually not worried about the side movies
i mean
ye
he saw what happened with jurassic world and was like naw
probably why that director did too
which is why they backed out
but they’re getting blamed for it
i feel like the directors are not the problem
unsalvageable
these scripts have been like
the director just works with the script
but the script
i mean jurassic world’s issue was with it’s script as well
hehe
i mean its like the directors who are working on it have never even once spoken to one another bad
yea
this shit doesnt make sense at all
like at least they fucking make sense
at least the prequels had a coherent vision and idea that consisted throughout
very upset that they decentralized the directors
im also
it plays out like a fanfic
its like a fanfic
its shittttt
yea
none anywhere
they gave him a waifu
but they didnt
yes
absolutely
yea
agreed
ye
i dont think i want to live in a world where i can equate star wars to pixels
i want to kill myself
is fucking pixels
the best uh example of the tone for star wars
holy shit
except even ghost busters has more integrity
but nope. they made it like ghost busters 2017
this would be incredible
like a three-part version of mulan
if they had made this star wars
a little boring, but i wouldnt hate it, itd be like realizing, “oh, ok well im growing out of this franchise i guess.”
it would have been fine
a simple good vs evil struggle or whatever
just make it simple
dont try to suggest any possible interesting development for anyone
dont try to fake kill off leia
dont even try to push for that shades of grey shit
if they just stuck to the idea of keeping it a movie for a younger audience.
even with the production team
it could have been way better too
idk how people like that
its retarded
everything
yes
i could write an essay about how the corporate need to make everything accessible kills literally everything
yea
im pissed because the story literally went nowhere
its still pretty interesting
from babies to like 14-15 year olds
i mean
to a baby this movie is like a 10/10
that shits fuckin nutty
because to babies
thats like. treating your viewers like babies when its that often
the bait shit reaaaaaly gets on my nerves
but they did
it wouldnt have been if they didnt try to bait
its frustrating
yeah thats v true
i just hate the sounds
i dont like hate the people who do it, i get why it happens, and its very unlucky
also to clarify
and like i dont think stuttering is something that’d usually do that, but it did there
i dont know where that came from
where it like literally hurts my ears to listen to
because for some reason, within the past like couple months i’ve developed some kind of prejudice against speech impediments
im pretty biased about it
also
thats super nitpickey tho
i mean
cause stuttering is associated with nervousness and the last thing benicio’s face looks like is nervous
and that of all the weird quirks you could give him, stuttering really doesnt fit that well
idk i just thought it was an extra weird stutter
sometimes he stutters over some t’s sometimes it’s p’s, and sometimes he says them just fine?
is that it’s gotta be consistent, or it needs an explanation
i guess what i mean about the stuttering
i mean thats gotta be pretty frustrating
naw he killed snoke, and got a chance to throw his tennis ball at a brick wall
ok rant over
is boring af
because that 
and dont say that they’re about her because of the people that she helps or that she changes
why are the movies even about her?
i can actually say in all seriousness that rey has the depth of character of a cardboard box, because she didnt change at all over the course of two movies 
*rey
a guy playing tennis with a brick wall
his interactions with rae are like
as the one believable, realistically portrayed character, in this unrealistically wacky dumb ass movie
but the fact that everything else is so stupidly wrong makes kylo look kind of dumb
kylo ren is the only thing the new trilogy gets right
i’ve said it before, i’ll say it again.
except kylo fucking ren
everything in the movie feels like random bullshit
if you’re not gonna give the dude a reason for stuttering, why make him stutter at all? its bullshit
get that shit out of my face. thats fucking insulting to him and to me.
and its the most fake, forced, random stutter i’ve ever heard in my life?
you make him stutter????
like of all the things you can do with that guy’s awesome voice
AND they wouldnt have to hire benicio del toro to stand around like an asshole and stutter
and there wouldnt have been a stupid pointless subplot
which would have cut down the length of that stupid film by like half a year
not to mention that there really wasnt any reason for her to be a bitch in the first place. she could have been a normal commanding officer and told po her plan from the get go
where the pink hair bitch acts like a bitch for an hour and a half until you find out that “actually no, she was really making the ultimate sacrifice and is the bestest rebel ever
and a 6th bait and switch moment that i forgot about
for artificial tension
because they made po a retard
slow as all fuck
line
in a straight
because the bombing ships decided to fly
her character is literally that her sister died
with no character of her own
and this paper mache cookie cutter hopeful rebel skrub
that guy
him
and his general misunderstanding of how star wars works
and the directors were basically playing hook up between finn, the funniest, best guy ever. who’s best selling point was his confused attraction to rey
because she was barely a character in the movie proper
everything about her felt fake
which, in and of itself is a stupid fuckin decision
character
which im pretty sure only exists to introduce this asian chick as an important charachter
to finn’s pointless side story bullshit
they dedicated like a solid 10-15 minutes
AND its a stupid movie
ok my break’s over talk to you later
its a terribly written movie
BECAUSE WE GOT YOU HAHAHA
and then no wait HE ACTUALLY DOES DIE
where he doesnt die to kylo’s lightsaber
with the retarded magic astral projection
then with luke in the third act
then with kylo killing snoke
then with rey being drawn to the dark side or whatever with her stupid visions
then with luke trying to end the jedi, though that had to have happened
1st with leia
5 different instances of bait wnd switch
they tried to pull like
because of all the bait shit they pulled
by the third act i could not even begin to care
way earlier
they ruined it way
no
when it wasnt
they were trying to make it look morally complicated
they werent
no
but it didnt
it could have
gutter trash
is
the script
and the movie failed because of that
they were given a complete dogshit script
but its like
the design excellent
the cinematography was great
like the whole film
thats what i mean
me too
the artificial conflict
this movie is filled with btw
which
just to generate artificial conflict
and they kind of took poe’s character and made him into a retard
there was literally no point to any of that happening
see im coming from the perspective that
i actually can not see how people like it
and i couldnt stand it
its just terribly written
ofc its not entirely bad
i felt that the likable parts were way outweighed by the stupid shit
since i didn't want to put expensive shit into it's correct place until this prologue
it's in 1.0
aradia's playlist is finally finished for real
oi any way you could call my phone, i can't seem to find it.
That shouldn't mess up the flow at all, if anything it'll make it run a little better
that'll be like
there wasn't
it's been a long day
and don't get back till 12
pitchfork=trash
that shit's gonna be funny
i'll go back and read them in full in a bit
it's retarded
it's better than [B]revor
i don't get it
cleo's got a sense of style
that most girls don't have any sense of style
and it's weird af
i just realized that my jacket's built in turtleneck is actually fucking huge
we'll hit up lego land like we're fuckin
i call this one "the hassling"
what day you come back to la again?
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
oh
"i think im getting drunk." ~my blitzed as fuck aunt who thought i'd ran away or something after i went to get the ice cream.
so the video wasn't moving
didn't hear any rhymes
i would have told you that you shoulda ended it at the part where vica says "good"
if it wasn't for that hug
AND HE'S ALPHA
if you've said yes to all of them, then theres no hope
you're a fuckin dirty weeb
they're weebs
they're like music nerds
because I really love Japan and it's nature.
. And I feel them, because I really love Japan and it's nature.REPLY
What a original and unmistakable band. I don't know much about their personally, but after listening some of their songs and listened to their lyrics I feel like they really  had some passionate affection for nature and without no doubt, about their country. And I feel them, because I really love Japan and it's nature.REPLY
are you telling me he didn't close the fuckin cut earlier?
nigga that doesn't change the fact that he derved it
so what you're fucking telling me
smooth
“No no no, it was super cute, I'm just, like...”
nice
i like your style
i think you messed up the skype inputs for italics
i think you messed up the skype imputs for italics
sounds good

i can still remember a lot of hld
so its fresher in my head
*finishing

understandable im also
fungal wastes is a lowkey banger
greenpath, king’s road, city of tears
v on point
the area music is
its got some good pieces and some baddies
its aight
thats a similar response to what i expected
boom. that's the part where i hit you with the double finger pistols and blow my brains out in the cabinet under the kitchen sink.
dunno, you're just gonna have to make it fit
anyway, you should prepare your ass... cause ya boi's got some more prologues on the way
i almost fuckin wrote a comment explaining this shit on a youtube video of the song that's how you fuckin know im mad
but in the fucking nosk fight. they fucking pluck the fucking strings.
i think this means that i have to give the best boss battle music that i've encountered in this game so far to nosk
also when i say it's all violins that includes violas and cellos because of course, without those instruments there wouldn't be enough range. but the problem is that the way every note in the song, aside from that fantastic 30 seconds, is played in the exact same way. and it's shit
and those 30 seconds blow most of the fucking soundtrack out the fucking water
and it's shit because of it
and realized that it's literally entirely violin
its the only other named ship
cool
ic

i've been trying to do that on the version i have
it's shit
there ins't a feature that allows you to jump to the beginning
my computer only shows the that's p much it
what are shanta’s unnamed kills?
o
imma write a few today btw
o
yea
i was thinking about the impact of the deaths rather than the impact of the lives i think
*picked elesa
yea if i was thinking of it like that i would have p
pretty funny
ye
weird
ye
probably would have saved elesa in elesa vs pringle though
deafio vs pringle i’d have saved pringle too
gone as in saved
yea
if it was deafio vs polya i probably would have gone polya
now
sad times are the best times
good
deafio will live
and because seeing the star wars name on a movie like this one is physically painful
the people who criticize it are being lenient because its star wars
yea no
i wont say anything until you watch it, or until you say you’re not going to though
it makes me think of fucking owl movie
owl movie
that movie was like
all the people who like it are retarded
that movie was fucking dogshit
its a 2/10
i mean one of the sides is retarded, i just dont know which one
thats why i had to go
same
k
0 spoils
0
wont spoil tho
i’ll tell you if its ass
yea
shit gtg
snar wars is starting
o
any
i didnt write
r i p
you didnt lean back?
o right
sitting where?
wat
second i found lucky’s dirty secret stash
first wtf is goin on with my phone
bro wtf
now that's incredible
which is more cancer than nothing at all imo
yes but you have to plug that into the charging port
no wired headphones = no fucking way
shoulda went for that my dude
6S is the last good iphone
the 8
ewwww
tbh i’d rather play some absolver
and it feels too soon
i’ve gotta hit you with a christmas special later
but regardless
being something other than an iphone
not that it wasnt already
i mean from what you said it sounded like your old one decayed into a steaming hunk of dogshit
iphone?
what kind?
extra af
its
i saw that
k
ok
hell yea
o
ay go for it
on both accounts tbh
yea i feel u
i may be slow to respond from here on out
alright, its time to show these absolver kiddos what for
ye
ok
repping hood politics
ive been
nigga
damn your break is muuuch longer than mine
for how many days will you be there?
and there will be a little muffled “suck my dik” from the suitcase
“why the fucc is dis suitcase 300 pounds”
they’ll say
you’ll be at the baggage check thing
can i go in your suitcase?
fuck
watchin chicken little 2
why dafuq do all my nibbas get to go to iceland while im over here
iceland
the next 2 days
except like
whenever
i mean
com 62 is ready for whenever
o cool
i like
still v solid
none of thats saying its a bad prologue btw
o
imo rp kills have more gravity due to the emotional impact, moreso than the impact on the plot
so no, it does not count as an rp kill
ibsi’s had a total of i think 5 lines of dialogue in the entire story
she hasnt even had a prologue for herself
and none of why it’s important has been mentioned either
she hasnt been mentioned in the rp at all
yea but
its not
no
well i guess she had potential to be pretty cool
well i guess she hadpotential to be pretty cool
or
ibsi was pretty cool
feels bad tho
since ibsi hasnt been mentioned in the rp at all
thaaats a prologue kill
and it appears that nearly all the people who dont recommend it do so for the same couple reasons: not enough handholding so they can't figure out where to go pvp is too hard, and the story is too short. I can understand the complaint about the story, but the others just seem like they suck at videogames
imma rate my strongest single fighters that we've seen so far.
:|
thatscool
rly
a little interactivity from veritable
there you go
k
that bitch gon pop off
then hit her with the double plague
plague her up
you take anunda
das why ophi is dabest
anyone amped up by plague will be incredibly strong
i mean
yea
is gr8
plague
oof
this bitch is focused around enraging other people
while like
so Anunda has powers focused on herself with a twinge of aoe irrationality
*c
iv
that gets me amped for h squad covert ops
*missions
for like covert missione
thats strong
nice
yea
whats goin on?
he doesnt remember?
is she driving him like insane so
so violet’s rage?
so we don't have to waste time
he's not a talkative dude
i guess he's got some off time
like we won't be seeing him for a minute
but he's on his own team
he's a bounty hunter
i can skip the bullshit
im in a league game but
well
ok
same here tbh
rip
lol
And Bos is very talkative, not like nice, or mean... I guess impassive in that regard, but still very opinionated. But he respects tough people. So. I suppose he's got a broner for cypress.
And Bos is very talkative, not like nice, or mean... i guess a little impassive in that regard. But he respects tough people. So i guess he's got a broner for cypress.
M'hzet, Excitable, pretty talkative, a little egotistical, but still a generally gracious dude.
oh i didn't describe any personalities
it's not like you're just killing them off in spirit
the ones you don't pick will still be in the story in some form.
and dw
pick 2
And Bos-qiat is also a big ass damage man. he's like Tony the Jaguar to Boenn's Tony the Tiger. he's big too, shrugs off bullets like flies.
M'hzet is a support type, who shoots tranq darts out of that big rifle that slow and gain increasing chances to cause confusion if he stacks hits on people. Also has a pocket net gun to immobilize peeps. Won't hit very hard at all though. might have some poison darts or shock darts that stun as well.

So Eao is a punchy-psionic. only uses like, gravity adjusting and force shit, like push, pull, maybe some kind of boost to push herself, some sort of push cone that'll send people flying.
and we'll do the last part later
i'll write it down here
wait it's almost 5 am for you bro
this is definitely taking place after elesa's abduction btw
ic
im a bool
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy guess wat
dam
its a v good version of it tho
ye
goes a fucking long way
but art direction
absolver looks like crap on my comp
look at this fucking cunt's cunty face
on my end at least we're down quite a bit now
and it's only like
just cause they don't feel like going
you didn't rape them
i fell asleep in the middle of it though
that was a good prologue
that's wholesome af
she'll fix u up
what you up to?
but i have to reeealy toe the line in terms of what i can say or who i can do
where i can do prologues
im in a prologue limbo
its weird cause rn, until like com 6
feelsbadman
but they cant happen for a little while
man i was thinking up some good ass prologues
yea
omw home from work
wassup
vro
i’ll join you in a bit
omw back noe
yes
its nice to not have to constantly listen to people talking
yea
i like playing league solo a lot more than i like playing with milo jett and eric and those hoes
tbh
ic
wtf
alpne???
on league
c h i l l i n g?
and
you’re playing league
im a bit of a hungry boy
i am quite hungry
for you see
gon get a burrito from this taco truck near my job before heading home tho
im finally free
okay 👌 
k
ye
rip
i was on break at work
nope
game is fun
oh my
but when you do
so you gotta get your ass whooped in pvp to catch up
and not very many enemies have them for you to learn
and unless you start windfall (the dodge ability class) you dont start with access to more than like one or two of these
since like really quick windups light attacks dominate pvp
so far the only problems i have with absolver are balance issues
is skype snapchat now?
wtf are skype highlights
wait
fuck
suddenly in my top 5 favorite gamws
absolver is like
those songs suck dick
and i want to blow my fuckin brains out
i hear loyalty and love literally every time i get in a car and someone turns on the radio
cause humble’s alright
and im pretty salty about that
i havent heard it once
never play it
they just
no
so like
and the super shitty zacari one
humble
the only fucking kendrick songs they play on the radio are fucking loyalty
and kendrick
i was thinking about the taste thing
also
but def not as is
they could be the okc of neo soul
if they mixed up the structure and like kept up the expiramental stuff that just putters off after the intros
changing the length is a much easier fix tho
its too fuckin long or too fuckin structurally boring
its good
ye
wtf
which is like
intro verse chorus verse chorus verse chorus and sometimes another chorus
but they go like
they could totally do intro verse chorus verse chorus end and itd be great
just end the song
its like they do 3 fuckin loops of the same damn thing
yes!
bogged down in fuckin traditional song structure they are
i think the problem is how like
it starts off full of weird cool undertones and it sounds fucking awesome
i think the best example of it is aint that easy
like
diangelo is frustrating
god DAMN
that's some good shit
and absover looks at that difficulty wall and is like. "bro. i got you."
i just don't like the difficulty wall
to the point where it becomes a strategy
way too easy to knock your enemy off a cliff
they’re too cheesy
power things
the problem is the like
its kinda ridiculous
is rly satisfying
and the little sound that plays when you time it right
theres this timing your hits thing to make them faster
since there arent any guarenteed hits in this game
feels so incredibly good to pull off a combo
so good on the gamefeel level
this game is
yea but we didn't realize
we're living in a musical shitpile
jett's idol
he's like
but you've been bringing up  old examples
i don't consider rym as like
the real fans know it's gone to shit
but now it's mainstream
there isn't a single thing that the general public has good taste in
there isn't a single thing that the public has good taste int
and if there's any one thing that's true about the genral publid
that's
i don't have an infinite amount of shits to give abou that
and that's too involved for me
so there isn't aaaas much competition for the classes you want
cause it's community college
or they're all gon be gone
thatd be the most neckbeard thing ever
logic: in anime
if there was a psych class called
pretty close
thats memey af
nice
oh dope
classes
the side courses
or are they laid out for ya
but do you choose them?
nice
dota 0.5
dota?
he made
he remade warcraft 2?
but what about them side courses
cool
ahh
have all your classes planned out for you from the get go?
so do you like
for sure
sounds like a cool guy
his voiceover in it is very uplifting
cool
that felt good
and got to experience the hipster indie cuck life
i saw a speedrun of it a few weeks before it got popular
yea thats a good game
thats the same bennett????
OH
hope ur not weak
hype
for making that frustrating ass game
he’s a dick lol
oh that bool?
oh 2?
condor fuckin blue
:0
o cool
uti?
who’d you play as?
its good practice tho
ye
noice
ic
ic
oh i see
the com is coming too soon?
rip
das a cool project
wow
wat
and it could be anything
is that allowed?
for a psych class?
a game
you made
cute
ok
ok
same
i havent listened to it
from a name like diangelp
i was def expecting worse
ye
ic
p soothing
the music itself is nice
the roots are good but i dont give a rats ass what the race of the people who made it are lol
don't really want to find out
i don't know who that is
like just the movement
ive watched a lot of clips of it
thats good
you have to csncel out of a groundpound tho right?
yea i’ve heard they feel rly good
dive cancels and hat jumping
like the arial movement
i’ll probably get it sometime
yea it looks very good
douchefuck is pretty good
you almost did
^
i’ve already told you all the issues i have with that album, but its not so bad that its worth arguing about
sure, whatever.
i just didnt wanna say it to your face
objectively both you and him have your heads up your plebian asses
nigga
i respectfully disagree with his opinion, but do agree that he’s patrician af
:/
...
i didn't make the 50000
def not
yea no
*might
that moght be my favorite in the game
and a dungeon
theres like 12 new solid shrines
yea
and then you ride it
they just magic it smaller
it is
they add like
yea
and they explain it as a 5th divine beast lamao
you do have to earn it
its not free thats for sure
its not memey
no
but the novelty of link on a motprcycle is nice
and its not like crazy fast
well it controls like a piece of shit
have you ridden it?
that they did it
its sick
no
its fuckin sick
ye i got that
o
until i remembered the time i fell asleep with little by little on repeat on the plane
which surprised me
my most played album is tkol tho
i dont remember them

i’ll just have to hit ya in the head with that prologuathon

less of a waste of time to rp from 10-11 than it would be to play league of cucks then
itd probably be
either way
its kinda funny
auto-winning every biggest dick contest
*like

or it’s just a really shitty story
its either fantasy
and theres nothing that makes sense 
is you write surrealism thats entirely surreal
the problem is that
but
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
surrealism is easier to say
except
i dont see a discernible difference between the two
thats just surrealism
its haruki murakami
so
ohh ok
its too focused to be a genre of its own is all
so its a subgenre
i refuse to believe that its its own thing tbh
literally nothing to do with science
scifi can have
yeah but sci/fi isnt either
not fantasy
lul
its a subgenre of sci/fi
oh
magic realism?
donny darko?
like
related
subgenre there you go
nah
everything is a subgenre of fantasy
i call bullshit
is or subgenre of fantasy?
yea
harry potter?
so is magic realism like
why?
am entire book?
what the fuck did you just send me?
its a shifty genre at best
those two words together dont mean anything
what the fuck is magic realism?

they’re like floating chicken drumsticks with horse physics
that are designed to move like horses
everyone rides pieces of chicken
the kfc racing game
sounds like
the fuck is that?
w hat?
wud?
cool tho
oh dam close
julias
yup
but im not right
so technically im right
he’s a record label producer
he’s a fuckin producer
his name is on every goddamn song on the radio
khaled

pls
pls
that’ll make shit go quick
but w/e
the second half’ll be harder to speedrun
i’ll pre-write the cypress, kisket and sirie sections
we’re gonna superspeed next time
yep

D:

its like
k
you got any peeps you’d like to see in there?
and i dont know what minor characters to put in there
anyway theres gonna have to be like a team of 13-15 others
im thinking oxium-infused fossils
im thinking oxium-infused fosdils
following tracy, kisket, and veruvi as they get trapped underground on tahl-sfarti and find
very very different

just WATCH me
just watch me
i'll find a way
as long as its possible

buddies

wtf
lmfao
they'd be taking place like a week or 2 after 60 at the very least tho
do them before the next season
i could maybe
neon, Kaiden, mav 22, or tobin
you choose my next prologue
yea
hot damb sign me up boi
in the same building?
u get the cat and the dog?
thats lowkey hype
i want loop and boenn on the same team
tbh
can
trash
a
thats a classic one
yea he's joining H-Squad
maboi's a stowaway
oh

most thursdays i work 11-4 my time
maybe
yep
lets get it
so
well im free all day both days
feel free to interrupt with some dumb shit abd delete it
if you ever catch me writing a prologue
also
if you were free tmrw or thurs
i was gonna ask you
s t r a n g e
thatd be
cause
that better not be what the fuck's boutta happen rn
like
loop is team 3
dont tell me
oi
skype likes to open to the most recent recieved message
i keep forgetting that
kms
gotchya
gotvhya
boom
yep
that also means its true
and if you confirm it
that means its true
or if you dont confirm or deny
if you deny it
100% real
elise
is
the general
this one's 100% correct
lemme shoot out a new theory
nice
noice
that the ophidiate said a lot more than 6 words in that prologue
i hope it didnt go over your head
umbran's quite a guy
incredible
big
not large
b i g.  intestine
b i g
big intestine
small intestine
but w/e
but less cool
ice cube
id have preferred
when i get back from work
i'll listen to doolittle tho
rip
it wouldnt work as a first song too
ic
id put it in the end after the last song
like a little god in my hands
i put them at the end
with those
understandable
i'll check it out
ye?
 and making sure that monad's supporters stay monad's supporters
so he'd mostly be dealing with putting an end to any lingering suspicions that monad had a part in goregok's death
makes sense
yeah
mhm
oh i thought it was a little big
*sure
for syre
ey thanks b
vica doesn't immediately say "You're right. I don't want to hear about your problems."

it is
dam right
zachthazel
about

im gonna do
ok
oh
deh
cause league's kinda cancer otherwise imma be real
ye

: O
: O
at thresh?
duh
well
, _ ,
fucc
did noah play any league games against people?
oh
OHHHHHHH YEAAAAAAAAAAA
ic
for reasons
its important to know
a mole on the inside?
does she have like
dam
so she knows all the pirates?
cool
so they can go to the ckivogue
when we get there tho
in that case
probably let you know what veritable's been up to
i should
about people
rip them lmao
thats how blah blah station got cleared out super fast huh
makes sense tho
know that
i didnt uh
really?
hehe yea
i dont tho
C C C C C C C C C O N D O R     B L U E E E E E E E E R
i vote
dope
rip saccharum 
oh
hmmmmmm
i dont think i can see anunda as the new varfalque though
good on him
pickey choosey thing
that means the saccharum's safe for this period's uhh
assuming hes actually dead
so
this is good
hell yea
it was supposed to
yeet
for sure
oh ok
coo
sup
idk
yes
wat
died
my computer
k
rip
L O L
yep
F U C K    Y O U    G O R E G O K
ofc
until i make them
in la
cheesesteaks
the best
this place that im working has the best
b o i
the place is only open till 12 on the weekends
but
they're confusing
ye
and then my moms comin over
i work from 11 to 4
im not sure how available i am today anyway
k
Mhm
i just wasnt invested in the characters
i think like by the time the plot twist came
yep
a generous 6/10
like
conclusion: it was alrigjt
absolutely true
lmfao
yea
eh
the best part is the opening and the nostalgia
d o p e
the one on the left is garbo
have some edgy cyberpunk tzezeren
here
all the time
everyone has a goddamn trenchcoat
i basically mean
but when i say blade runner
at the very least
idk destiny has a sick af artstyle
but like
it lowkey gives me cholera to say that
destiny?
these hoes look like a lovechild between blade runner and like
thats not at all what these hoes look like
cause
very especial regular monad troops right?
chromatin look like
i may have went too far on the designs tho
and then cooked up some bullshit to give them some character
and started an ophidiate
went and drew a rough tzezeren
so i
itd be him
he doesnt make movies, but if he did
H.R. giger
i forgot about
wait im a fool
actually!
the issue is that everyone else blows more
so thats how its gotta be
and ridley created the idea of blade runner. dennis just used it
or ridley scott
so its either dennis villvenue
im also judging solely off the merits of what these people make. whether he's racist or not doesnt have any bearing on it.
which cuts an entire third off his eligibility 
but the dude who made that went on to make motherfucking chappie of all things
and district 9
which isnt super sci-fi tbh
the only other truly sci-fi movies since the og blade runner have been wally
all my respec
great guy
bested only by lord inarratu
second best man
king of scifi
glad he's getting roles in big movies
hes a good ass actor
and they used my nigga from captain phillips
fucc
since he was the exec producer and all
this just further cements ridley scott as the king of sci-fi in film
goddamn
(ok)(ok)(ok)(ok)(ok)(ok)
where the color pallete goes from greys and blues to gold and black
the entire scene
that shit is orgasmic
vegas
fucking
my god
yeah easily
yea
10/10
and some of the more conflicted faces
his crying too
the expressive parts were incredible
yeah
but they werent
nah
he was playing a robot
well i mean
yk
since they didnt fuck it up
but thats probably a good thing
especially for sci-fi
and the story was all in all a fairly simple one
the plot twists were pretty obvious
the acting??? incredible
and fuck
and the sound design
the artistic direction
jesus fucking shit blade runner was so good
ya boi got the moves
ay
clearly
"where's the nearest bathroom?"
that ones easy
yeah
oh
yeah
k
of me as the snapchat hotdog
a video
i also have
wanna die rn
i highkey
thats my mom
to witness some shit?
you ready
yo
oi
in n out is pretty heavy my dude
enough for five grown men
their "normal" fries are like
that is true
nah
but yeah
not nothing
tho they're close
not in n out
*fast food burger place

who's gonna put their card in the thing tho
y e s

bed?
i gueeesss i can do one a little early
well
but realized that i reached a point where i cant do anything else
i was boutta write a prologue
k
i dont think thats a thing tbh
maybe by making her oxium like eat her? idk
i think she was a human with tech oxium and this guy is essentially turning her into a computer somehow 
well i guess it means there are more than one ways to make an ai
i think?

regular
: |

yea i did mention him there in that prologue so you'd ask that
but
tracy and veruvi also ran into him once
doing his thing
he's hangin out

i meant to tell you earlier
you're pretty close to the point where all my major villains are introduced
oh wait

starts at S3
but her playlist like
same with kates tbh
tracys meme songs are integral

shoulda waited on those

[12:00:46 AM] corduroy queen: "Questions."

&lt;&lt;&lt;

saying ahead of time that your ass will get in the way
covering your ass as much as it is like
also thats not as much
thats not even true lul
much more op than yours
in general
my characters are
it probably wont even matter that much
yeah i know
feels fuckin bad
i fucked up one of neon's quotes and didnt catch it
also
hissy fits are expected, but shall be ignored
henceforth, both participants shall roll with the punches and understand that shit dont always go your way.
establishing the "roll with the punches" decree is a good idea
but yes
rip everyone else
mars' is too tbh
his oxium is literal plot armor
lmfao
it'll be cool
but dont worry bout it
raros
aside from like
im not gonna like kill your characters
i mean

rip u
fukd to shit

pringle is doom?
oh

:/
(ok)
: P

i can see now why you do that shit
ive done some foreshadowing recently that you're never gonna catch
its funny
that's gonna change p soon
but
i havent done as many oxium missions, and none that were only one night
which is alright
is probably 46

:(
cya
sweet
this car is in the spot across from ours
fasho
can't i gotta edit this thingy for a friend of my mom's
and i cant spin it positive in any way since liz didnt take pictures
cause that last scene was depressing
pringle needs to grow sum balls
i c
why
wat
like
that elesa is the single most oblivious character in the rp
im gonna just assume
with the elesa being confused line
so
especially if you imagine polya with a knowing stare the entire time.
it just made this conversation more awkward
its fine
nw
lul
for some sick parrallelism
ready to be forcibly inserted.
u
r
o fuck.
if you want it to be my people, you can go for it.
i mean

the setting hasnt changed

if you want
oh
dont choose anyone
ur skypin julia
actually w8
choose
fine
blehhhhhh
bleh
y not
liz isnt a bitch like that to anyone but tracy
if liz gets pictures the only one she'd show them to is pringle
unless theres a specific reason for them not to exist
there will be pictures
naw fuck that
k
she's blackout drunk
i wasnt even gonna type anything else
she wont say anything
its all good
she's just nearby
she's not in it

so like you could have a dude as saccharum for one cycle, then a woman for another
cool
ok
ok
Uorde for Kranstom 2017
or does that not matter
for the kranstom
so you'll never want to nominate some big brute motherfucker
so when they choose candidates are they choosing them based of how they fill that chromatin's role?
and role even?
and oxium theme?
they keep the same armor?
so when the chromatin cycle
o quick question
like 11 or 12
actually nvm unless they're at a party, the guys at my old high school would fall asleep pretty early
i dont know anyone who does that these days

but like
fair

i dont think i have every single character in there
fasho

iambic words are stronger sounding in general tho
idk the name of the word doesnt matter that much
trochee?
kivogue isssss i forgot
kaivogue is iambic
i just like the sound of kivogue better
u know im just fucking w/ you
its definitely that

in 4 days
i'll be back
i guess we'll have to finish it tonight then?
ic
ofc it is
more or less, dog killer
10/10
incredible
what a boldfaced lie
or something equally horrendous
you're supposed to say: fuck you mars for forgetting your charger. i'll kill your dog
:///////////
nome of this would be happening :/
if i hadn't forgotten my fuckin charger.
sorry that the rp might not happen for a few more days
ye
next time i see you i'll fuckin give you the book
it's about architects but it can apply to anything
a really fucking apt description of the world and how it treats people who make great things
cause its fiction but it's like
its imperative that you read this
as someone who wants to create shit
and artistic expression
its about art
even if its like a page every two days
make time
this book is earthshattering
that doesnt matter
bitch
im reading it for the second time rn
you have to read it okay?
the fountainhead
this book
since their crazy shit is very obvious
glass doesnt glow really either
glass is dark blue and light black, and mirrors is silver
and for the last colors
ripiniterino
on a species you havent officially seen yet
i revealed some deets
oshit
yea
since you're just neutralizing oxium with your own oxium
technically yea
yea
um
purge is grey with a little red
plague is red with a little white
Plague: The oxium infection, plague types spread oxium. They can charge latent oxium in things, and spark oxium powers into uncontrollable action, ignoring any direction from the user.  plague types can create and spread oxium afflicted zones, where oxium creates and alters matter according to the will of both the oxium as an entity, and the user. In these zones, all oxium powers function at a much higher capacity. All Svelle are technically plague types, but the vasr majority of their oxium is spent unconsciously on prolonging their life.

Purge:  The oxium neutralizer, Purge types can spend oxium to block and cancel out oxium effects on others. With oxium in them, they are immune to any damaging oxium effects and can purge oxium affected areas. Without oxium, they can heal wounds and "neutralize" objects, removing any extraneous forces from affecting that object. Plague types cannot be purged

lemme copy pasta some shit for you
ok
ruin is very physical
yea
stupid vague
and it can be pretty vague but not like
vox is a triumph with a strategist specialty
not that specific
but its not like they're bad at everything else
ye
and triumph weapons like a shotgun would have ridiculous range
like for instance, Zazani is basically un-hittable with ranged weapons when she's got a melee weapon in her hands
instead they have like a specific thing that they are like completely unmatchable in
because they're naturally good at everything
they might glow, but triumphs dont have any activatable abilities
so we good
okok
but thats over
dinner time here
sor man its like
naw
so like w/e
but they're never gonna glow
triumph is gold and white
ruin is green and dark brown
got h a s s l e d
i
ok colors
all my cousins on facebook and shit
2 many ppl using internet in a place that doesnt have very fast internet in the first place
its just
it should be better later on
idk if i'll be set for tonight

my pending is killing me
i'd like to say i have anything planned for 52

at our first hotel
i forgot my computer charger
nice
imma kms
i fkn
• Tracy - His attacks get exponentially stronger the longer he's able to combo them without getting hit. In combat this means attacking every turn and not getting hit every turn. On command, he can change his tempo, or the rate at which he appears to move in tune with the rest of the world. At low tempos, Tracy becomes a lot more solid, heavier, denser, etc. He's less affected by hits and can hit much harder, but he's also slower snd much easier to aim at. At higher tempos, Tracy starts to appear blurry, he affects the world less, and hits weaker but moves much faster, and is much harder to hit with any attacks. When things do manage to hit him, they hit him much harder than they otherwise would.

incredible
with the afro
his picture 
i just got stomped by a dude named atlanta's finest in halo
which is good
so they get paid
except like other rappers i guess
and nobody cares
but like its 90% the producer that makes it good
omg jay z is so good
like they'll say jay z's new album is fire
i guess im talking more public opinion
which is bullshit
yet jay z is being credited
the talent your listening to is not jay z
thats what i mean
so tjats not jay z
jay z doesnt even produce it
all im sayin is it doesnt take talent to have good production
mask off is a retarded song
mask off has solid production
2/10
its a bad album
its bad
wtf
terrible
its depressing rly
but he himself is not good in them
jay z has good songs

i didn't remember that
oh
where?
oh?
i could play two games in one day but i will fall asleep at some point during yours i can promise you that
and that one starts at 1 and goes till 6/7
and another that was going to be last sunday, but got delayed to this one
i've got a different game on saturday
or you can go on without me
maybe sunday 7-8
i mean
not really
no.
hmm
tf is this?
thats clearly lucia attempting to gain the patronage of her next ancient evil pimpdaddy god.
huh?
that guy’s not a guy, that guy’s a bear.
wait a sec
idk what you’re talking about
internet shat itself
yea
nigga
like angry japanese man miles?
and his non japanese cuckold manservant?
i see
my max range is 120 feet but the extra 180 are just to be safe
300 feet away from my character at all times
stay uh
well whoever ends up being the mayor
fair
u some kinda racist?
lizardfolk speak common
it makes sense
adopted empire kid crocodile
i volunteer to be the mayor
im a crocodile
yeah
cause i volunteer
are we still having one of us play the mayor?
actually
and fucking Crocodile Dundee?
we're missionaries
wait our hq is a mission?
you mean to post that here?
did
otherwise just play normal ek
if we started the campaign at level 10-15 then hell yeah do it
that's two years of being deadweight
according to this timeframe
oh you said dozen
you're making these level 11-20 builds like we're just gonna be there
i don't want to be useless for upwards of a year.
we started eric's campaign level 5 and it took a year to climb to 11
are we playing for lategame?
is that in the early levels you have dogshit spell slots
the problem with your build parsa
as soon as this gunslinger dies im playing a warlock
no
and neither is powder
cause bullets aint cheap
its battlemaster but more expensive 
im going gunslinger
idk bout you but I want me that extra 5 xp
so basically you’re gonna fuck us up for the first 5 or so levels until we can fight back?
im gonna wait for last hits and let you niggas die
its the same shit
yeah
how was i supposed to know she was just gonna throw a lightning bolt through her own teammate?
the hell is this, what about my milestones?
i never saw that
and then kms

no way
pregame skribblio
ok you fucking nigglets
2?
ever
and frankly i don't want to use it
i have the shitty thing built into my laptop
not really
it'll get better once they start treating it like league and completely ruining its game balance
but the maps are too big and the movespeed is too low for it to be any fun imo
fucking useless game
yep
praise our new chinese overlords?
god emperor xi jinping

LOST LINES OF PHANDELVER
2020 is the old one
cyberpunk red is the new one
now you're just telling me to play Penny 2.0 in your game?

plz and thank you memelo, thank you gamestop.
drm free games, good boy point based government stimulus, free tendies, government mandated gf.
drm free games, good boy point based government stimulus, free tendies, government mandated gf.
all that sounds good and all, but i'm not down for another single player rpg stuffed with p2w microtransactions
xd
on god if any onna you nigmas ks's me im gonna fucking eat your face off.
but never trust a company like memelo to stick to his word
you gotta open the forums
the masses are demanding answers, memelo
but never trust a company like memelo to stick to his word
pretty sure mod support's slated to be added post-release
xd
i mean no better way to prep for the only game releasing in 2020
ic
but 2020s got more shit i guess
there should be a playtest version of red out
not red?
cyberpunk 2020?
Niggulon is a level 0 commoner with the legendary Heater of Capping, which he found stuffed in his oversized shorts upon waking up from the aforementioned 20 year coke binge.
I’m a robot named Niggulon 3000, who was built out of trash and spare car parts in the darkest corners of the ghettos to be a replacement father for a young, highly intelligent orphan. But Niggulon went out to get some milk and ended up going on a 20 year coke binge and now has no idea if the child he was built to protect is alive or dead

yeah same

and the second nigga is a nigga.
that first nigga ugly as fuck
ok got it
4
whelp
4
same tbh
so 5 mins was a lie
cool
yuh
aight imma need like an extra 5 mins
same
alright session at 9
ye
it's nbd
9
but i can do 
8 is 3 hours
oof
sweet
sleep schedule fucked again. I just woke up, i can run the session in 3 hours
arright
Oh no
is a meme?
this
this one will be a meme as well
first one was a meme
every other
wednesday
aight cool
except im the admin staff?
and that used to be split among the admin staff
ye fair
and how much of the guilds income can i siphon into my own pockets without causing all the little guys to leave?
or do i have to manage all that shit now
how do i handle the profits of the guild? like does the Whispering One take most of it even though he's an extra-dimensional entity without earthly desires?
so my only real question is
is finding him what that gigabitch yumiko wants from us in the first place?
isn’t he looking for syvanna?
oh
he’s still not back?
idk, thats like the equivalent of letting a bull lose in a china shop and hoping he doesn’t go down the aisle with your stuff in it
a happy hooker is way better than an unhappy one
plus we don’t want them drugged and enslaved forever. The endrugment and enslavement only lasts until they’re acclimated to their new roles, then they get paid a healthy sum for their contributions
i appreciate the gta level fuckery of that option. but finding and “training” more hookers is a pain in the ass
lmao
also
like fkn, imagine you go to a changeling brothel to get it on with someone you shouldn’t and the next day you’re anonymously sent a picture perfect painting of yourself doing the deed
or minor illusion
Got your own two eyes and a paintbrush
they never get to live it down
blackmail solves all problems
maybe if we record him fucking a changeling that looks like his sister
all the gods r dead
lul
but mostly sell em
and use em
and then we can sell em
we're goin all hands on deck, we need whores bagged, tagged, imprisoned and drugged to hell
do i get to roll followers?
im leveling the establishment from 2-4
ay eric
oh
delicious
and yeah 250 a month is certainly better than 0 a month
about the first bit
ur probably right
you oughta branch into the whoring business. More profitable.
lul
honestly thats better than bein paid
can you get all your clothes enchanted for free?
the real questions 
do your kids get free tuition?
they paying u for that or do you get like free services?
dam
wot
yeah
from two-bit nobody assholes, to two-bit nobody assholes who can kill you, take everything you have, and be halfway across the world before you can say “oops”
oh how far we’ve come
long game feels good man
and finally, after a year of playing the long game imma spend this downtime bagging and enslaving the shapeshifters i need to make the dream a reality 
i’ve been talking bout this shapeshifter whorehouse since day 1
i feel like its been more than that
since eric started this one with parsa?
a year?
hol up how long have we been in this campaign?
after that penny should reasonably be able to buy whatever the party happens to want
i've got a plan, but that means for the first few months of this downtime i'm gonna be pretty fucked when it comes to cash
alright
we're golden gods
poggies
i think genetic summs that shit up nicely
mom idfk she’s crazy and narcissistic these days
which i am currently still in
my dad’s a definite entj, but i didn’t really know this nigga till i was in my 20s
genetic personalities
itd make sense for one of your parents to match or be very close
personalities are products of your environment don’t even pretend
i see you
ngl
judging big gay though
anyway intj, very cool, means ur a thoughtful motherfucker
straight retarded
getting funding for research is like me trying to get an agent to publish my book without a manuscript 
oh that’s actually a pretty sound reason to not get into that shit
thats a pretty chad job as far as the sciences go
be an engineer and get into explosives xd
^ true
thats all im sayin
don’t go to college if you don’t know what you wanna do
they just are
nvm i don’t care why colleges are retarded
why?
counseling?
haha
yeah well choose a different type bucko
im ripping into miles for claiming snowflakeism
b you’re lying and wrong
a youre wrong and you’re lying
so one of two things is happening here
here at istp industries we don’t take that shit from anyone.
oh iths tha leasth common perthonality type ohmygosh thats soooo me i didn’t get it but im gonna pretend i did on my tumblr.com because im so unique and cool
why, you some kinda intj liar snowflake bullshit artist?
uti was all about that shit in high school
yeah
how certain can you be that they're retarded?
oof
1? ok.
ye?
wtf i thought it was 4
oh shit it is
is that fr
ok
so if you want to join, you’re gonna have to make a character that already lives in hell
and jett’s character had his memories wiped
everyone is trapped in hell
oh now that i did that first session
6-8 works i think
4
ay milo click that link and get in here
very relaxing, and simultaneously cleanses your bloodstream of impurities.
is that nigga getting jabbed straight through the neck?
7,8 or 9?
ok what's a good time to start?
no
for sure
so it wouldn't be 3
i was planning to start earlier
fair
Collin you want in?
*oh
h
alright
and 10
m w f sun? jesus
that's a great ideaa
fuck you
if it continues i'll have a spot open for you
unfortunate
fucking go for it
you'll be a bunch of badasses on an airship hunting big name bounties for big name cash.
you'll all be level 10, get to choose any one magic item you want. im usin eberron races classes and items
otherwise
666666666
if you wanna play, decide by 6
boredom suppression for your ass

no answers at all?
dam i was outside
what the fuck is this
i keep hearing different shit
ok good
tomorrowtomorrowtomorrow
or
999?
so
tomorrow would mean i've got like 7-10 hours of this shit scheduled and that shit will fast-track me to an early self-induced grave
i'd rather tonight
tomorrow afternoon wont kill me
same
1-2 pm xd
idk i could do it if you guys wanted to start at like
that starts at 6
im in another game on saturday 
you want two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda?
anything else you want before i invest a shitton of money into my bathhouse filled with changeling whores?
ay collin
she look pretty dead, my g
o fuck
should i be worried?
i don't know what that thing is or what is happening
10/10
losing their shit
cause you see him and all the motherfuckers in the car
dude i love this one
now im goin down this rabbit hole
aw fuck
tails
heads avaris tails main quest
i'll flip a coin
here
in avaris
azir
vote avaris for president 
plz
avaris
is it still simping if you’re clappin them cheeks?
lul
very clean indeed
but thats a move penny might make in a heartbeat
would mars think to do that? no
i mean
big brained
pretty fucking dank
that's
lawful evil, that means not a chaotic shitbrain
yea nah. We don’t do that here at Pennyworth Inc. 
if you want it i’d want to rescue him but after that i’m probably gonna have to fight you over it to stay in character 
if you want it i’d want to rescue him but after that i’m probably gonna have to fight you over it to stay in character 
unless eric takes this guy and makes him totally useless
i do know that apparently one of penny’s old goons has a metallic and the hresvelgs are keeping him locked up
idk dawg
penny wouldnt like it though
i think i know where we can get one
if it comes down to trying to convert a rune
oh
jk i gotchya
nah
mmmmmmmmm
thats exactly what i wanted from  mahara
oh my god
lemme buy you the aluminum tools and then give you a 3 time ingame pass where I'll do whatever you want me to do. in exchange for that infernal steel in the death spear
so i want to die
i just found out that buying that metal is too expensive
ay jett
kek
but i’m very stressed atm
can talk
im playing kenshi
may not be ready till 999
im a lil busy
idk
me want coronablade
knight
i have a character using that image in my campaign
lmao
yeah.
innocent
the uh
protect
to uh
can i have
o
x fucking dee
poggies?
everyone does
yea dog
don’t tell us what level you’re gonna do it at
and 2
except 1 don’t make it level 5
level five suddenly your marked and theres an army of peasants with pitchforks coming to burn your house down
actually that sounds better than both options 
that sounds fun
do it pussy u wont
end it fag
that means you're the final vote
my gunslinger character is a lizardfolk that looks like a fucking crocodile.
would my gunslinger work in that? not at all.
personally im a fan of the outpost one cause it sounds like a dank meme
i like both ideas
sounds sick
except better
so the same thing as the original campaign idea
ok
im gonna pregame go get food
due to the corona virus locking all the gamers in their gamer pods I’m not gonna be late
aw fuck
2 minutes ago you say?
we’re starting?
LOL
but this girl gets put pretty much everywhere
idk which one
fate series
milo does this give you a boner?
she's quite literally a cash cow.
this bitch says she's about to be an empress though
i play penny as a pretty cautious individual who doesn't really like having new faces around unless they prove worthwhile
just because we don't immediately decide to be butt buddies with someone doesn't mean we're gonna kill them.
she's not that waifuable
i didn't know what the expected timeline was at all
the difference is right now or a year from right now
as a player who has set up something of a home in daggercourt
or at least mine
yeah and im cool with being hired to conquer that place because it's a truly excellent business venture. i'm just trying to give you the player's pov of this scenario you've set up
we just need them to be good enough to get us to the top
doesn’t even matter if they’re the best of the best at that point
regardless, thats called a fucking raid
thats accounting for 3 of us having a relic and glorfindel having his own
4 relics with 9 tagalongs each means we get to bring an extra 38 people
i think detouring to hakone for any reason is a pretty dog brained move, why not just take the dagger for ourselves, go back to daggercourt, recruit glorfindel and check out that tomb and potentially run up to azure peak with 4 relics
as of rn we have 1 relic, on our way to another. We know glorfindel has one and he’s in daggercourt, and also that the tomb of gemi is in daggercourt
and thats why i call lucia a wishy-washy bimbo
she said she wanted to take over her clan first and foremost
nah
but thats only if we go to japan with her to help her out
like yeah she promised to give us some elite warriors to help with the azure peak thing
the difference is that she lives on a totally different continent and has expressed the intention to take the dagger and head straight back there.
it actually makes less sense for our party to just up and give it to her, i don’t know why this surprised you
we want those
that dagger is a saint’s relic right?
exactly why should we let her do that if we need those things to raid azure peak?
she wants to take the same magic item we’re trying to take
parsa hasn't been playing this game
get discouraged because of shit parsa says
don't like
and then she asked for help
and most of that session was just us trying to not die
since we only saw her for one session
there's so far nothing to like or dislike about her
i like rei
do the a-men currently have a stat for hp?
here's my question
actually i think lucia definitely fucked with her first
and also get that dagger so we can bring 18 dudes along
frankly i want to go do this extra shit in hakone so that we can get more people
im just saying that we're not murderhobos
im not saying it's not
Pad Greencock
it was great
yeah
ofc we're gonna wanna kill like half of them
when the ratio of nps is like 90% important 10% unimportant
the thing is, right
that's a a-list name
i really like lad largebrew
ship captain was tryna take my money and nobody else was gonna pay
we literally only interact with npcs that are involved with the world and story in a large way
that you don't account for
that there's one thing
eric i will say
collin don't hold back
dam
me too ngl
yeah def
oh
i judge lucia for being wishy washy and way too willing to commit wanton murder
for lucia being a female character
sorry
who's judging you for playing lucia?
what
loli michael reeves?
uh
my burst works best when they're asleep anyway
i have her character sheet
parsa a lying slut
who said us niggers wanted to fight rei?
do they use drums and runes?
and thought they were like drum shamans
i read the first beasts as beats
wtf are the ice hordes?
rip
so gunslinger will be dog
oh
wow im gonna have to try that
wait are you saying the charactermancee aint dogshit anymore?
pretty sick
wow
cool
but what about the weeks after leaving
like im assuming that the bullshit in the city took 2-3 days
how much in-game time has passed since we first arrived in enadian?
oh
shootas gotta shoot
lmao
everything but the coronavirus
maybe 9:99
idk about 9
but you can go on ahead.
i know it's already 7:23 and you all dearly miss me
fella's im gonna be a few hours late for our 7 start
the wizard for sure
i think this describes all of parsa's character's pretty fucking accurately
777777
77777777777777777
7 pm?
murder is the method
4444444444?
4?
its about as racist as saying 90% of redheads are witches. it’s not racist if its true
yeah but they’re teiflings. The idea that they even have souls to give up is a point of debate
makes sense.
hexblades and shardblades really are the same thing now that i think about it.
oh
also based
understandable 
alright skribble
in a sec when i get home sure
like 30
yup
sounds about right to me
wenk
fina drops an angel in a jail cell
none of the other gods have dropped angels on us, so they're all dead and/or fake
no what?
but she did pay me money, and money is the most holiest of holies. so she can't be all that bad.
it's different by a huge margin
syvana's angels are made of cats
i believe in fina
i'm a simple dude
oh shit
gay
2big2fail?
enronicus?
imma be real impressed
if you can clap cheeks and be back in 30 mins
alright imma go get me some tacos be back
can we just leave?
decide that i don't want to go into the pig dungeon
what if i uh
i forgot dnd was at 7 im gonna be about 2 hours late
aw shit fellas
i don’t think so.
we’re 3 humans, a half-elf, and a goliath, right?
aight 4
but i can buy someone who DOES
no.
how high would i have to roll to draft a legally binding contract that allows me to stab lucia on demand and have her sign it without noticing
fuck
the real question is do i really need a reason to stab lucia
wat do
but i don't know lucia invited them here
and im upset with lucia for inviting them
i hate the eye monster things
yeah i was a warlock with eldritch sight
oh right black empire
kevin's darkvision?
?
fun to use too
the dynamic lighting is great
dam
rip
good luck homie
ok
ew apple
k
oof
9 weeks?
oh right 9 right?
7 hours tho right?
yuh that sounds right to me
2 more hours?
soooo
yeah cause i have fridays free and nothing better to do
same
99% chance im late
so that's anything
you can choose 2 spells from any class at 18th level
cause of magical secrets
and with wish you can cast any spell
bards get access to wish
they're like wizards but not nerds xd
bards r sick
actually yes i have, but it was only 1 session and we didnt do shit
i haven't tried bard tho
monk is dank
icic
what have you played before?
honestly would
david byrne?
never go full parsa
full parsa is a thing
when we restart
you'll see collin
imfukcin dying
whoops
s' not like you're stealing from people who don't deserve it
s' not like you're stealing from people who don't deserve it
s' not like you're killing people who don't deserve it
nah they're "good"
oh helllll yeah
whatever it is im still rollin gunslinger
selfish motherfucker aint tryna save ashina
if anything sekiro is the villain
i mean technically genichiro aint a bad guy
well once he's dead it won't matter. makes no difference in the long run.
people callin him jacob
joe
are we not just gonna run up and stab him?
i mean 
we need to blackmail the entirety of local government
whorehouse
slash
still gotta find a desert tribe of changelings that i can use to staff my bathhouse 
tis true
we all know that even if parsa's good he's still gonna be an asshole
oh
team too slow
you were up on a hill dog
and got fucking rekt
he just tried to solo 4 wolves
victor ironflex was sick
and my next character will be a scumbag too
my character rn is a scumbag
ONLY YOU CAN SAVE THE KINGDOM\
look at fucking skyrim and destiny
wrpgs do the same shit
yeah
start at level 1 like true plebs?
but that aint fun
it is true eric coulda gave you a definitive no and made you look retarded
arright
if that aint mcs idk what that is
your cleric is related to your god by blood
bruh
^^^^^
^^^^^
very true
lol
cause having a goal of "just kill people and turn them into trees" is kinda dumb and something he can do without working for it
chaotic evil loftier goal
based robert fuck yea
but
this guy playing cant parry for shit
cause his evil god still sends angels
thats how you know lautrec is correct
by saving his life with deadly poison
well miles killed him
"suspicious" lul
"hey i stole 100 gold from you. i already spent it so i'm loaning you 100 of my gold pay me back by friday"
"hey i stole 100 gold from you. i already spent it so i'm loaning you 100 of my gold pay me back by friday"
eventually you'll start finding notes in your backpack.
that's how it works
i'll yoink whatever i want, thanks very much
fuuuuuck
i forgot
that had the entities
aw fuck you deleted the handout
you can't stop making me hate lucia to make me hate iago more
no we know they're after lucia and the book in her head
yuh
if it was sacred an angel woulda done that
when you burn a grove, demons shouldn't pop out to defend it
hey can we say that over my travels i paid my petty to assassinate that fucking cunt?
technically he's still alive
he used fuckin inflict wounds they shoulda cut his head off.
then i'll cost me 30 gold
you know that's 10% of my fuckin taxes right there
and i'll never get that back
fucker cost me 30 gold
yeah
i shoulda killed iago
the problem character was motherfucking IAGO
he just existed and talked shit
he dindu nuffin wrong
noxalas was alright man
idk bout you guys but i think parsa's dropping noxalas was a good call that made sense
yes.
actually
no
and then 1 in context one
five total no context dropped characters
so
yeah
it was padding the stats
but most of that 600 damage was not gonna hit us regardless
he tanked like over 600 damage
we killed him
drakki was a dude and he didnt int
and then he left campaign
cause he didn't die
+ the dude after him
inting is cool
no
right when he was leaving
for no reason other than to piss him off
she ran up and talked shit to the bbeg
hit her with the disintigrate
yea
you dusted valyra
nah valyra stuck around and then got dusted
fighter was someone else
valyra was a drow
no ur right
OH
valyra was the fighter
yew died so i had to switch too
and she stuck around
valyra was him
drakki died
oh wait 5
cheqir and then uh
yeah
for no reason
4 characters leave prematurely so far
he's had i think
that way they get more resourses to do the stuff and have no choice but to use them
i think all you gotta do is double the ki points then removed the free unarmed attack as a bonus action
you're kinda useless during said rests
basically yeah
but when shit's real you shouldn't have time to short rest between fights
you do get it back on short rests
if you don't you're dumb
fighters have great mechanics if you choose the right subclass
which at level 2 is 2. 2 ass.
you could do that as a fighter, except in combat you kick as much ass as you want, instead of as much ass as you have ki points for
cause monk blows
yeah
feelsbadman
when does monk get buffed to have as many ki points as the mystic?
and sick
wonder why i said i wasn't crusader
i'll be the dismas to your reynauld any day
l m a o
now that'd be some shit
depending on how long the timeskip is i might just play cheatin chip
a big bald fucknosed blubbernecked animal
we've got a fat fuckin piece of shit to kill.
well we'll get there when we get there
ok
im pretty sure you said that 2 sessions ago, now that i remember
i see
OH
in order to get in there?
do we need 1 relic each?
but ^this is likely either way
idk if we'd get that far
poggers
parsa's?
alright
LOL
I kinda really want to hear him doing his japanese accent for 3 hours straight
I uh
fucking old men climbing outta your neck
bruh
said alt?
is it not owl?
if it's in the same world im playing a gunslinger
i'd be down
i have no idea what next campaign would be, but if parsa has a character for that
so when we overthrow the government and instill penny as queen bitch
i see
or the whole thing
like conclude the running to shurima bit?
what do you mean conclude this campaign?
oh?
as far as i know, concerning dnd, nothing pisses off parsa like being on a team with us.
as far as i know, concerning dnd, nothing pisses off parsa like being on a team with us.
so it really just checks all my boxes
90% of why i have him in there is just to piss him off.
tbh i started dming a campaign with some other mf's i know and parsa's part of that one, i wouldn't be upset if he quit that one to play this one.
xd
u
no
Whelp Collin, as the only good character in the party, you've got your work cut out for you
fair enough
i specifically mean from lucia
i dont actually know where the dislike for jin came from and  why it's a thing
i dont actually know where the dislike for jin came from and  why it's a thing
^ this is truth
at least not yet
chemical warfare doesn't sound super profitable.
i can’t stop you from sticking your hands in that good good
we have yet to talk to a devil
i’ve never said don’t make a deal with a devil
s h i t
yaint
i want to make a deal with the god of cashmoney, sacrifice your firstborn and gain a small sum of a million dollars
goddam
but fuck you
still love her though, wouldn't tade her for the world
i blame lucia for that too
im really glad that we finally have someone to blame for taking our normal, profitable adventures and turning them into a massive flaming shitheap
also
Im a motherfucking force of nature. we don't need no patron god
LOL
so imma
so this is lucia's fault???
nah xargul
you bring one in and they suck out all your blood to make more of themselves
demons are like the hell versions of mosquitos. 
and this time was some weird shit
nah last time was a demon
and sometimes they're pretty cool.
and devils know how to crack a good deal
devils have structure
just not demons and cosmic entities
im down to deal with devils
naw that shit funny
yeh
well how far are we going with this thing? we pulling an indiana jones? or a holy crusade burn every house check every anal cavity?
he had some pretty fuckin good characters in that game
and drakki
i was a fan of cheqir
which isn't correct imo
either way parsa plays dnd to win
and if they all got to 20th level it isn't unlikely they'd chill in a city together
especially considering adventurers tend to travel in groups
a city of 40k though it wouldn't be impossible to have at least 1-5 20th level people
like the numbers are kinda inflated to be more realistic but this is fantasy set in a medieval setting.
and then like 50 or so stragglers with their own farmland in between
maybe like 2-300
i doubt that villages actually went as high as 500
idk the villaige math is a little off
seems about right
yeah
fuck
before we head out we can always use the mirror to scry around for it
as sure as i am that it won’t be in some rando’s basement, it wouldn’t hurt to make sure
x ddd
now that you’re not hot he’s gonna make you pay for shit
bamdul with the priorities
good shit
l m a o
thats sick
oh right bamdul can smith
if there is one?
what's his bail?
just rob some pushover nobleman's house
can i steal a shitton of money with my crew?
wow
this looks ridiculously good
aight b
get in here
rip
skribbl times
alright im back
fuckin gnoblins from the darklands
very not blessed if you ask me
coming from the blessed isles?
the goblins?
cool
right
regardless, House Oberlyn is newly instated and has no heirs and as such probably wouldn't be drafted into war at a moment's notice, would we?
oh sick
im not gonna try to say that the thieve's guild aint a highly mobile organization
we already have a character and a religion devoted to fellatiating gemi
hresvelg
(puke)
in a semi technical way
because we "work for" a chinese chick
we already failed on that end
well the optimal play would be to sneak into one of their impoverished towns and engage in chemichal warfare by spreading a plague.
i see
and we're gonna get fucked when they attack us
so looks like the arentian kingdom sucks compared to the jin empire
okay
why would he do that?
thats
and thats the blah blah sappy message between cosmic entities and groups of murderous bozos that stick together over a long period of time
but the warlock isn't fighting alone
well sure
but thats cause raven queen is celestial but with a triple dose of edge
raven queen warlocks are a thing
that's essentially all of them
hard agree there
def
but i as a warlock player and i as a dude who wants to dm for warlocks, think that patrons who loan out power at all are probably bored enough to fuck with their warlocks regardless of if it actually has any effect on their own power gain.
i like that
yeah
also why warlock is the best
or they lose their magic
in exchange for magic they sign a contract that allows the dm to royally fuck them in the ass whenever they so please.
ye
wild sorcs are ones with shitty magic
that's just wild magic sorcs
no
my great grand uncle plowed a dragon and now i shoot fireballs out my ass
sorcs have it even better
like how i tend to play dnd
the difference is the moron takes the one roll and sticks with it
the low res equestrian art really brings out the sacrilegious nature of the menorah. i think its pretty good.
the uh
its capiche
kapish is kinda not it
i run on a basis of late until proven early
you know me
maybe in our dreams
i think actually having to set foot on a gemi planet would give me cancer in every functioning organ
im a fan of this canon
which continent has carim?
shurima's total stealable value is probably much higher than anywhere else in gestalt learning land
shurima's total stealable value is probably much higher than anywhere else in gestalt learning land
and as a thing that exists to be stolen
way out of eveything else's league rn
mean specifically that giant floating gold sun disks and massive moving stone statues and city shelfs that move and part the oceans of sand is like
cause as is shurima is incredibly high magic compared to this campagin
you'd probably have to nerf it for the world
well we know milo's vote
lmao
penny wouldn't and doesn't care about any of them
uh
ok
yeah that was never a good idea
it's an app, right?
but the font is fine
gets much harder to read the smaller the words get
i didn’t do shit last session 
ehh
you haven’t described shit about it
fucj
and march our way up there with a whole ass tribe
i think we should check on the goliaths at the fisher
but i think we shouldn't teleport straight in
now we're headed to orrak to kill your sister
yeah
ok so 7 thursday?
xd
im down, but only if we can eat them and sell their beaks for profit
&gt;:0
also i wanna go to the circle island
alright gimme my inspiration then you fuck
alright gimme my inspiration then you fuck
that im not even gonna bother showing proof that i found that shit
it’s actually so easy to find
alright i found it
did you start with our continent or nah
actually not against it
im
house dolladolla bills?
hresvelgs will see house pennyworth and think oh yeah that girl that hates us
cause Pennyworth gives away too much info
also Penny is now a noble house and needs suggestions for a house name
about 3 years that will be multiplied a hundredfold
and in
without doing any actual labor
i'm making a grand total of 8gp 3sp a month
and my business deals in daggercourt have paid off
i did all the math
SO
bitch you live in the ghetto
yeah id kinkshame that
nope
santa monica
yeah id kinkshame that
yikes, good luck
you can always just lie
i mean
aight b
yeh
sounds good
ok
probably be here bout 9
aight imma be late
start in 15 right?
so
borrow indefinitely
that said i'd also enjoy seeing what's up with this beanstalk. especially if it has valuable things to uh
which is something that i'd like to do anyway
if we decide to start at 7 you can always say that penny went ahead to go scout the Father
or maybe 11
like 9 or 10
imma be late
nah sleep is for the week, now
x d
same?
xddddd
get shit on, casters
xd
i don’t think Penny’d actually push you too hard to open it. She’d rather bring it to her boss in the Guild.
it most certainly is scary
its cool but i grabbed it cause nobody else seemed interested at the time and Penny’s probably too dumb to open it
im willing to give the puzzle box to anyone who may want it btw
so we gotta kill everyone outside of that hall, then we go and take the book for ourselves as a reward
DONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUSDONT DELETE HYDRIUS
DONT DELETE HYDRIUS
lets do it
yeah
yep
arrite
which blows
which means at best 3-4 hours late
jett said a maybe on 9
so 5-6?
estate is doing well after the villagers arrived theyre converting vyrmias's tower into a fuckin wizard tower and morozov got into the alchemy game, selling that shit for war, respect on that, war is a cash cow just begging to be milked. hes also looking for a new wizard since vyrmias is shit at enchanting cause he’s a fuckin dragon and he doesn’t actually know shit about magic.

gnoblins
start at 2 pm so milo's late?
so
the fact that we aren't in the forefront of cutting edge technology is disgusting and it needs to be rectified as soon as possible.
as i am an industrious impious rogue superbitch, i also propose we try and get our hands on one of those gnoblin boomsticks. mostly because i wanna see how much damage a fucking sneak attack deals with a sniper rifle.
no problem
which means a month HAS passed and the daggercourt coffers are a-growin and we should definitely stop back there soon so i*cough*we can collect 
which means a month HAS passed and the daggercourt coffers are a-growin and we should definitely stop back there soon so i*cough*we can collect 
all of this stuff has been shared with me via magic letters or something over the past month of travel.
so uh the nation's about to go to war. luckily we don't have to worry about getting drafted or anything because we're useful members of society who work for a useful lord, and not random sacks of shit of the street who aren't making big money moves and big money plays like us.
hresvelgs sent elliots wife to jin in order to tide things over, but the portents say the hresvelgs are stupid and that's not gonna work. which i agree with. the hresvelgs are stupid
jin blames us and they’re seizing assets and imprisoning people in their lands. jin empie is not as north as we currently are, and to the far west of the main map.
lastly, the fuckin jin empire was supposed to send a diplomat down south to improve relations and forge an alliance or smth but their ship was attacked by god knows who/what and has disappeared. don’t bother asking your gods because they’re dead and can’t answer.
just for future reference
i propose we call the gun goblins
the gun goblins are real, and there are also a few sightings of these spooky hooded magic dudes that are killing a lot of people. they’re like tall thin dudes with shadowy teleporty bullshit.
apparently my spies spotted omega bitch syvana in the silverpine forests. she’s lookin kinda fucked up tired and shit cause we sent glorfindel after her. she’s got zombie thrall people doing her dirty business in a mine that i guess morozov senior - god rest his soul - and loren did bad things together at. spies captured and interrogated thrall and it was like “something something pure silver makes the runes, something something sticks and water.”

other shit about the city… invasion in the south diverted joe riegan from his bullshit coup, he got ordered to reinforce the troops south while the rest of the kingdom gathers for fuckin war, apparently the fat fuck is doing pretty well moving goods, troops and making a killing, piece of shit fuck dick-in-ass bitch he is.
they also caught syvanna talking to the nasty flesh monster. he was looking for something that she needs and he killed a giant or smth because it didn’t know where thing x was. and she got all pissy like usual, but he said water knows where it is and he needed to wait for water to get back to him. and then she said something about handling the gatherings and then the petty took off before she grew any wiser.
alright new info
k
i wanna take that fucks head off asap so we can sleep without having to worry about an abominable flesh amalgam breathing down our assholes.
*hydrius
after we kill this fire thing my vote is to sleep it off and head for omega
well we’re hunting on the way to omega
xd
why do you have court?
craftsmen cave but they’re dead
court xd
but once we finish binding all the masks maybe we can fix that.
im fairly sure that ship has sailed
very very fair
xd
or if she was, you definitely didn't say she was
she wasn't wearing magical mech armor tho
invention?
she's pretty alright
but she's the character that your gf made, right?
yes
not 
not 
lynell  character, right?
lynell  character, right?
never happen
lemme just make that shit
BAD
MY
fucking yikes
wow
sorry
fuck you
fuck
whos dick we sucketh, verily?
that we all love?
oh most gracious and benevolent dm
did we get a short rest in there, btw?
so we all just bodyblock milo and tank hits for the next hour, basically.
if you succeed it, you get to stay as the avatar but he becomes you and you die
well no
but i know a guy in league with the name Enron 2 big 2 fail
im not sure if you have him in your friends list
IS THAT YOU?
ENRON?
ic
or can he not do that?
so basically auto fail that save, please?
is that a cleric thing?
wait what?
that's rich
doesn't lucia have shit cha?
haha
well then good
ya damned monster
if you leave that circle im gonna stab you until you get back in it
imagine being the lord of all fire elementals and can't even speak ignan
plan B is to run in and hit them till they die
also, no run at them is never plan A. Plan A is drop rocks on them and run away.
you guys are the ones with the spells, figure out what to do with them.
when is it not my plan?
i mean i figure we just run at hydrius and hit him until he dies
and if i remember correctly i think Yew was actually a psion and he was kinda broken
int dump not wis dump
got the skills wrong
that's not true at all
fr
that sword was a big tiddy goth gf
i wasn't even a warlock then, i just had a cursed sword that told me it was a good idea
yes.
because entrenched in the shit with the boys is my favorite place to be.
warlock is my favorite class because i enjoy giving the dm permission to use my character to fuck shit up on a royal level
well
i didn't realize this was the post
oh i read this on reddit
i don't wear glasses, but that shit makes me feel like i have been my entire life
dude that's unreadable
nope
it's good we're in the mountains.
new mission, we have to locate a mine for these bitcoin things
aight bet
their motto is anytime, anywhere, right? chop chop, assholes.
according to this shitty value calculator, a single gold coin could be worth anywhere from 75 to 15 hundred dollars
actually
i think it's probably worth less.
well then definitely no
gay
1 usd isn't worth a single gold coin, is it?
well
no
that's a good question. Eric please?
we buffed him way too much
also hydrius is huge now
now hydrius wants to kill us
and
in some retarded show of dominance
and put fire's face on her own face
*gemi 2
and then gemi took fire's face
with a sword and a knife
i killed fire
we killed fire
uh
but i was right, 20 mins.
skype is loading
nah. Death Grips is art. Patrician fucking art
like cannibal corpse or something?
and his name is rides
theres only one mc who’s cock i suck

and not just an immersion breaking distraction
but really cause then me drawing dicks on the map will be in character 
exactly

colin’s pretty good
he's got non-friends blocked so let him know i messaged him
well fuck it
you can change your tag
he just has discord nitro
nvm he's no og

tbh i think that kinda gives him prio
yeah
how tf does a nigga get 0001 on discord
im gonna start axing them
sounds good
ok
1 or 2?
how many are we looking for btw?
all of them fit that bill so far
i mean yeah

oh i see
andrew and reddit username butfewlisten

lol add him
rly
l o l

so we'll fucking SEE about that mf
and immediately started talking about character creation
one of them didn't fkn say who he was
2 did
u missed out milo
top 5 sessions world
it was incredibly dank
we wasted a pretty stupid amount of time on our way getting distracted by asshole kids
and even more assholeish frost elementals
and bandits
we didn't find elsa.
UndercityCuckster
my skype broke af
idfk
bruh
i don’t wanna deal with any 17 year old pretending to be 19 year old never drank more than a jack and coke at their friend’s friend’s highschool birthday party that they were loosely invited to kinda bitch ass motherfucking children
should only be like 5 mins
im still making food
ah fuck
im making food
yeh
hard to find kevins out there
im down to keep goin
we start at 9:02, right?
im good
we must farm for mounts to defeat god-king asmon in the mount off of death
fk it why not
oh i should probably set up a guild bridge in arendelle while we’re there
that said only 2 more weeks in game before my bar is built and we start raking in a ton of backup cash that will be stored in daggercourt
yuh we do
ok its gone
AAAAAAAAAAA
WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
ADS ON SKYPE
ADS ON SKYPE
can we even hope to win if we aren’t willing to drop 5k on a shitty butt horse?
we do need to stop by vanilla daggercourt and buy all the most expensive mounts tho thats a hard agree
can’t get them back man, mount permadeath is the whole gimmick in the mount off of death
we must farm for mounts to defeat god-king asmon in the mount off of death
but the carrot stick dildo seems pretty fkn worth
i was gonna say that sounded like a flagrant waste of time
o
maybe a personal portal to the elemental plane of gold and jewels?
does he have a hoard with lots and lots of gold and jewels?
lets farm him for gear
xd
wow kms
wow
Lucia’s a carpet muncher?
tru
stared at people?
lmao
that’s pretty fuckin funny
wow
aight vro
but lautrec boutta freeze his dick off
and milo and i will be fine
well jett will be fine
kms
sick
a week?
btw eric how long has it been since we left Daggercourt?
ok
or for the weeks in between?
just those days?
if it’s any consolation, i just committed sacrilege in the house of a bunch of polytheistic freaks and now i have to walk home in this light but still remarkably inconvenient rain
bullshit ended up taking longer than originally planned
me
definitely understanding
cause you spelled it now
i do
and will continue to do so
im just giving you shit
i know
hahaha
how to breathe
thinking about
practicing 
you’ve been
and getting hit by motor vehicles 
i gain testosterone by breathing
gay body mass
more like
oh i meant eric with stopped hitting the gym
cause hitting the bench is ridiculously boring
i literally walk and run everywhere i go
you stopped going to the gym
? no?
^
i haven’t eaten since last morning so i think i still fit the cutting quota
they’re the best because their burritos are the motherfucking shit
its the best taco zone there is
Taco Zone
the taco stand by the autozone
no its an entirely separate place that is open now, that used to not open till like 9 or 10
and then im gonna bring my steak burrito into the indian restaurant and take a bite out of it when i pick up the samosa
im now waiting in line to grab a steak burrito while i wait for the samosas to get made
well it started as that and then it turned into a whole mess of bullshit
hopefully that wont take 31 minutes but you never know
but im gonna stop and get some samosas 
im nearly home
wow this is a truly blessed and miraculous turn of events
bitch
fking
and they're worse
they show up on mine
fuck you
fuck
huh?
aight vro, boutta head out.
i was gonna agree with you but the emojis make me wanna blow my brains out
well that's easy, im the only one without stage 4 terminal autism
ok
im rarted
in tft
oh wait you meant
trade bt for sanguine blade my dude
i guess you’re just dead
oof
doesn’t make sense
idk
he bopped the fuck outta that fish
bro
why
yeah long live the empire
ulfric gay
well
i can respect a meme that doesn’t hide its retardation
wait wtf
also that knife is upside down
is that a puffer fish?
id personally rather not fight that giant motherfucker without miles’ dps
gotta be in santa monica by 10 on tues and its a long ways
as long as we don’t go past like 1:30 on monday i should be good
k
ok then lets play some fucking videogames 
you’re playing a goliath barbarian if anything you’re in the correct state of mind
well man what can i say?
oh. thats me at every waking moment my dude
start now or 30 mins from now so that you can sleep
so what you're saying is
looks like we're good
nice
windfall would be better
absolver on kb+m is kinda nice tho
so much smoother when not on one
i don't know how you do it
nigga you don't even play with a controller
that shits ridiculous
oh and the fuckin trial of the fool
and fucking forget about all the shit in the godmaster dlc
still can only barely make it through the radiance
still can't beat grimm 2
those shits are actually hard
but the boss fights
botw is probably better in that regard yeah
it's a lot of fuckin content
hollow knight with all the free dlc is op
imo
undertale number 2
it's number 1
hollow knight
that’s the objectively correct answer
yes
that’s like the old thief game
and then as soon as you step inside everything is wrong?
imagine going through the pains of staking a place out and drawing a full map of a place
which is sick
which is sick
just turns their mansions into like actual dungeons
an auto break-in stopper
but tbh it isn’t like
i’d expect only house graves and house hresvelg would be able to pay for it
what level spell?
sounds dumb
when i get off
watch parasite, eric
fuuuuuck that pound that shit back like you’re gonna die tomorrow 
assume nothing 
jett hasn’t responded or read any of this
xd
shits confusing 
i misread miles
oh wait kms
can do both
gotta hear from everyone else
k
but not sure if that works for you
without much problem
or monday or tuesday
i could do tomorrow
i only get thanksgiving day
and same goes for sat
cause i don't get off of work on sun until about 10 pm
shift at 10:30 am?
fk
and so is sunday i think
saturday is kinda crappy for me
hmm
burn them for their crimes
kill the false prophets
that sounds like a big fuckin yikes
so
cool
ngl
jett your dude's pants are kinda fly
sure
the whole party’s?
rngesus has spoken
miles wins again
this one ends it
we’re tied 2-2-2
oh my god
first to 3
lets even odds
actually 
miles wins the d3
i guess it’s the call from the village 
i’ve gotta roll
thats some barbaric shit there
what the fuck
could also go for a third opinion and we’ll untie with dice rolls xd
miles voted already 
lets see what the other votes are
stick to that
but the fey thing solves problems with the city
do a bit of journeying
i think the distress call will be more beneficial to us than it will to the city, plus we’ll get to stretch our legs
anything we do here will be helpful, i think 
but that can happen before we even set out
im good with whatever so long as i find my girl Sabah and instill her as supervisor of the establishment and my lieutenant when it comes to handling the petty
which means it could be fun ;)
not something you rly wanna fuck with
but the feywild is
chilling out the elven guards will probably help the city a lot, at least for the short term
i just wanted to get more info from both sides
idc make your own choice
that sounds not good
is it bad?
what’s the word on the fey shit?
why the switch?
or beer pong
which will be settled by rock paper scissors as adults do
im either not voting or saving vote for tiebreaker 
im gonna take out a 3k loan from nathaniel and use it to begin making that house into a proper establishment.
aight
we could hire one, but not yet
he is a qualified priest
oh may wanna leave him then
anything
for protection from 
or does he shadow morozov 
are we gonna bring your paladin?
are you still lucia, milo?
probably, it’s just buying shit
cool
oh right
do we have a week or two for prep?
well fk it, im down with whatever you guys want 
oh cool
oh i mean if we wanna fix major problems outside the city
huh?
oh
xd
does he carry coins?
oh no, kappa
oh
we probably only have time to deal with one or 2 of these things before the king’s survey shows up
the way
if we have
squashing levels is not
hell no
We also probably shouldn’t kill riegan and his kid
Lord Morozov can wash his hands clean of this mess. I’ll worry about the nitty gritty details.
Respectable.
perfectly legal
legal drugs
we give aid to the needy
who said i won’t be selling drugs?
holy shit parasite is a good fuckin movie
i love this character 
holy shit man
we fix this shit
so
but we can’t rule a pile of rubble
penny is inherently selfish
i mean
xd
penny is the treasure girl man
just not current heir
or be a different morozov kid
i think you should stay
whatever will be more fun for you
l don’t assume anyone is a rational human being
idk
but i also didn’t ask you
everyone i’ve asked said you did
oh
do it pussy u wont
unblock him and do it then
THEN we go and finish the investigation with william grey
pin all those many crimes he's committed on him and have him executed
oh
sor
:/
[1574131532] Jett Amoore: It isn't a metric of most

&lt;&lt;&lt; wtf does this mean
no
if we all aim it at parsa, it's a problem
it's kind of a problem
if we all aim it at eric
it's about who's aiming it where
here's the thing
...
the notion that she even retains an inkling of a thought about running again makes me want to fucking blow my own brains out
ok
so that when we’re there they can be valuable without having to work for it
im willing to do it on my own while adventuring with these fuckers
i want to do that still
nobody wanted to grind into political standing
everyone else can be hired adventureers
i will be the noble, and i’ll monitor the house
fuck it, run those again with slight changes 
ok
which one?
and the want would have to override any want to see people having fun with it
unless I really wanted to
if that’s the case i wouldn’t make a campaign 
idk
and i would have strangled him if we were in the same room
parsa was playing fucking Darkest dungeon during sessions 
so of course it was retarded and everyone hated it
the thing is only 2 of the players seemed consistently engaged with anything going on
milo counts kinda
the 3 people don’t count
as far as i can tell
and only milo and i played the game
because they didn’t read the rules
nobody hated this one
the problem is
holy shit he was a moron
i forgot that guy
the guy
OH
xd
atlas didn’t get a chance cause everyone quit after losing to basilisks
but catering to the party is not the job of the dm
i agree
nor is it your job
thats not on you
stop trying to make people happy 
if a little retarded because of the deck
it was actually a decent campaign
the deck was funny
i was 2 sessions of of building my establishment you know how pissed i am about this?
and when parsa complained they just said yeah me too
nobody did fuck all
this reset shit? its stupid
stop listening to what people tell you they want and make what you want.
all i want is to play the campaign you fucking make
listen nigga
cancelling is all the rage
cancel parsa
theres an easy solution to that
ok not rand paul
xd
Rand paul
not president material 
she’s a conceited, self centered bitch
and she ruined the democratic election 
hillary is retarded
people should not be making them one
abortion rights are not a national issue
its retarded
i don’t know a single black person that doesn’t make sweeping generalizations about whites or mexicans
everyone is racist
thats why the whole idea behind racism being some kind of ultimate evil is retarded
remove the economic part and sjws will suck your dick
you said the same exact thing
yeah
is actually racist
[1574064483] Eric Huang: no im sticking with the hong kong people are just better and therefore the protest is more important

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
but just know that this
go ahead and say whatever you’re gonna say
well like
yeah
ok
take the pragmatist route its more agreeable than anything else you’ve said so far
go for it
who cares about lebanese and venezuelan people
yeah but
that’s wrong
like i don’t even know where you got that
and there really aren’t any third worlders fighting to install a communist government 
it needs reform
well china’s government is corrupt as fuck
and they’ve branded that cause as freedom
they still have specific desires they want met. They have a cause
hka isnt just freedom
heres the thing
and fighting without a cause is just fighting for the sake of fighting 
fighting for an ideology is not fighting for a cause
and its not necessarily a good one
here’s my opinion 
its an idea
freedom isn’t a thing
and yes it’s essentially the same
thats a class thing
its classist
ok it’s not racist
or the dissenters should have not dissented
hold on are you saying the govt shoud have changed to support the dissenters?
you’re still better
ieds no
molotovs yeah
at least in the HKA protests there haven’t been active bombs yet
yeah i guess
and those are two incedences
thats all south america
just dictators and other dictators and kingpins
and its rly never many civil wars
say that then
your nation ought to be a gold standard
yes you expect the nation that os your heritage to be better
it’s not racist
it’s not racist
with very blurry edges these days
but that’s a pretty thin line
its nationalist
the feminism that even feminists hate
lul 3rd wave feminism
instant shutdown on her complaining 
if she calls you out on it just say “yeah i guess”
just don’t be racist to other people and you’re fine
i mean
it isn’t racist on a technical level
i mean
yes that’s probably why
there are no ruins beneath the city with loot lmao
don’t lump me in here
i didn’t start this
i don’t care.
for the chat?
ok im making a new chat for this
have fun
^
just make arenas for enemy encounters 
theater of the mind the crawls
gather goods
senna’s fucking broken and everyone except riot knows it.
i don’t care so long as we aren’t resetting the story as a whole
i mean the detailed argument about openings
you said 1
you do
my vote tbh is 2
its not our story
i mean it’s not like this matters because 
the issue with mine is that in order to keep things impactful is that you gotta keep ramping it up
one is that your version is kinda done with everything 
i think it’s a stylistic choice that has merits and drawbacks to both options 
yes
in one session 
you can have all of that
so
ok
no
i like stories with abrupt action packed openings
i like stories with abrupt action packed openings
escape or die, motherfucker
you start with place is burning
you don’t start with place is burnt down
but obviously 
1 maybe
because i don’t want to play a novel
yes
why not just start at the something bad happens 
that sounds railroady as fuck
aight vro gl
you’ve got firstborns b
no heirs if you’re not noble
^^^^
while i shoot them with fireballs and arrows
i want to be brutally tickled by the police
1 for sure lol
take down the church with civil unrest and aggressive, armed protest
thats what im gonna try to turn campaign into
i mean
Kill china
Fuck HKA
yes they’re crazy
i like both ideas
plz
so i think i win
and my character will be a depressed black 20 something year old with no goals and no self image
Im down to take zoomer boomer seriously 
wow
fair
he thinks we’re his property 
LOL
how did you save them?
xddd
i need that buffer to ensure im not a fuckin aspie degen with no con
small pog
no drops?
shit
oh
this one will nor be that
eao was a shitty sorc
nah im goin sorc
its more fun to be nerfed
milo go magicless
magekiller
OH SICK

you want it so bad, try and take it from me
git gud
you’re just mad that you have a 4fun baby rune
no rune for me
x.x
kill yourself and die
Parsa 
i don't think it's a waste i was just joking
you cunt
wtf
OI
which sure, if we're getting paid, but why do you want to do that?
you said to lobby for the dwarf guy
like the whole point of this open ended shit is so that we can do what we want
if you don't want to do my shit offer up something else
letting me set the missions
yes
wait so now we work for npc lord morozov?
at least thats my angle
by taking it from everyone else, right?
rags to riches
but that's the point of the game
on her unconscious form
through viscous and unrestrained appliance of coup de gras
but not through combat
we bring her down
well
where it belongs
i'll send your ass to the grass
HAHA
except jett
but everyone plays lucia
we reset
new insanely good idea
fuck you my lucia's way better than yours
the imminent dread of the possibility of playing lucia getting to you, huh?
and draw lots to see who plays who
but we put all the characters in a raffle
we do this reset scaleback thing
i've got the best idea.
fuckin piece a shit
nah he ignored me
fuck you take my side
LOL
so that he could teach us how to put people in books
i asked vyrmias what spell that was in character 
aint nothin gonna hold me back
knives aren’t scissors
ez glap
stab the police tape in its eye too
we’re lvl 7 basically gods
stab it in its eye ez clap
too bad they don’t exist
same if there were ruins
real life sucks enough on its own
fantasy. i don’t want my dnd to be real life u fuckin kidding?
also
i wanna veg out and just roll with shit too
you’re not the only one that hates the fact that i come up with all the plans
just to reiterate
it's not like anyone aside from lucia has made an attempt to become an integrated member of society
i guess that counts
xd
especially after the last fucking guy
it doesn't make sense for any of us to immediately trust this necromancer who showed up at our doorstep
you should
cause im playing a character that has to warm up to people, xd
which feels good
every time he swaps i get to treat him like shit for the first session, though
we needed someone sane like noxalas
this one was actually pretty good, cause it fit him well and balanced out the party
it depends on the character
no
and parsa swapped characters 3 times so of course he has nothing
im doing the exact opposite
also true
just getting into the territory of kinda being known.
idk i'd say 7 is like
like
metagaming gay
again
well
level 7 isn't big
parsa thinks he should be able to get away with big shit?
that's how democracy works, motherfucker
so we'd go to level 3 by default
then the only opinion offered is a yes
but if nobody voices their opinions
we've got like a week to figure it out
anyway
or we can just not do this and i'll never die.
or we can just not do this and i'll never die.
you nignogs better pull out my rune and give it to my next character
you nignogs better pull out my rune and give it to my next character
xd
if i die
so
that said, not having evasion is gonna blow
the odds are stacked against you.
and if if you have only 1
cause 3 will drop
with randos it’s definitely better if there’s more
1 rando kinda sucks
actually, naw i don’t care enough to adjust it
if you’d allow me i’d adjust my build a bit.
that’s fine i guess
no changes out of game
same story 
so same characters
ok
what do you want to do in this alt universe where we turn back time a bit.
he’s not dm.
i don’t care what he wants.
i’m surprisingly cool with the idea
magic items, keep or toss?
just scaling back all the characters?
wait so are we continuing the same story and missions
thats
also if we do this im rerolling a sorcerer
why level 3 and not 1?
fair enough i guess
might as well hard reset and swap characters around 
why?
F
my vote is on 1, yeah
the more time to prepare, the better
i mean
as you should 
sleep is for daytime, man
sleep?
i’m gonna use the time to beat death stranding 
yep
fuck
why would someone build a city in hell?
that looks like hell
im no fiend
same
ok
true as hell
okay.
are you in call?
miles?
?
but yeah i assume this week
it's fuckin retarded
aight
but idk, doesn't seem like any one of us wants to run.
somehow
i mean if we wanted to get especially crazy we could rig the final voice of the commons vote
i c
and associating with devils marks you as less insane than with demons
demons and devils speak it just fine
just take infernal
his first mistake was learning abyssal
we’ll make do.
fair enough 
yikes
are the elves guarding house riegan?
oof
tough
actually w/e im not gonna push for that on the off weeks i already used my actions
we’ll put them on the rooftops so they stay reasonably safe
how many orphans can i get to throw rocks at guards for me for 10 gold?
Oh
quick clap em then run off
attach it to one corner of an alley and as soon as the guards chasing us get near he pulls it taut
i’ll have to change vorok with a maul to vorok with a big net
kms
no dropped rocks?
fuuck
k
but i’m setting them up and planning the escape route ahead of time
actually i’d probably have vorok and chip arm them the day of
even though the gods are dead and it’s pointless, gotta cover all the bases.
i’ll also pray to the gods of chaos that no dumbass commoners fuck with them.
but i’d also leave shadowmarks for the discerning individual that say “trapped” and “mission in progress/do not touch”
i would only arm them a day or so before the mission
the last trap i will set would be Vorok, hiding behind corners with a maul.
the tripwires dont activate anything, just trip people.
the traps would be trip wires and ropes we can cut to drop crates of rocks onto the heads of any persuers.
the traps would be trip wires and ropes we can cut to drop crates of rocks onto the heads of any persuers.
and then set traps on week 2
I wanted to scout the guard schedules around the riegan house
she’ll get another chance in the actual mission.
we’re goin in blind, boys
test failed too bad
i will clarify ahead of time that yes, this is a test. no pressure 
im really just giving her an opportunity to show her stuff here. i promise her a big bonus if she can find the riegan vault
she can sell it better if she cries
that better
shes a new hire and she was ordered to clean his room in lingerie 
bleh
and narc? i literally am doing this to help me kill the guy if i sound like a narc that’s probably a good thing
but she heard they used to be offering jobs to people who worked for morozov through the grapevine
for the honorable literally anyone else
ok
so she ran off and wants to work for the honorable riegans
Alright Eric, can I get Gale Ordella hired as a maid at the Riegan house? Her story would be that she used to be working for Lord Morozov but she thought the guy was creepy.
Alright Eric, can I get Gale Ordella hired as a maid at the Riegan house? Her story would be that she used to be working for Lord Morozov but she thought the guy was creepy.
actually on second thought keep him doing that
but patrolling alone sounds fuckin miserable 
like i like patrolling dont get me wrong
that sounds gay milo make him do something 
how do we level him up
oof
cause gods are dead
it don’t exist 
oh righ
a peak
its
k
oh
chad already has majority 
considering the decision hasn’t been made yet
is what i got
and technically all of them are undecided but these are just who’d they naturally favor
there are 4 people on the council that we don’t know
miles said he was looking for them
or do you know it's doomed but want to do it anyway?
if not then we'll have to have you hop the fence like last time
if that happens, then we've got options
that's what im having them do
we can put you in a cart being delivered there
but we have ways of sneaking you in
im not gonna ask for him to
parsa doesn't want to take part
so silent image is out of the question
and you can't really be concentrating on any spells during a short rest, either..
uninterrupted
i guess that'd work but that means he's gotta be in that house for an hour
it's also a 3rd level spell so it'll be pretty expensive
what about spell scrolls of fly?
hmm
?
how well do you think you could climb across a tightrope
well we'll have to sneak you in the old fashioned way
ok
but you're not a trickster cleric
cause i think jett can only take me
do you have dimension door?
you wanna come with?
aight then
and neither can jett
tricksters can't cast rituals
eric are any of the goons in my petty arcane tricksters?
well hooold on
i haven't asked them
actually wait.
i guess
but we could hire a mage
nope.
that's why im using my weeks to scout
i'll worry about the whole dragging my soul through mud part, gods are dead anyway.
alright cool
we have a week to come up with other plans
killing miren riegan and ambushing joseph
as for what happens next session, i get the feeling that parsa, you think this is also a terribly bad idea?
idk
yes. im reiterating
if we had someone in the running, i think it'd be fun to throw our time at it
it's not that i don't see the value in it. i just don't value it enough as is.
like helping fix the city, buying up properties, maybe trying to start researching house gloom
but i still think there are more useful things we can do for our own benefits
that said, if we were getting paid to lobby for this dwarf, i'd be down.
i don't value it all that much
im not playing a character that has any particular penchant toward being reasonable.
as it should be painfully clear
i only really care about this thing as an opportunity to put one of our guys on the council. if we're not gonna do it, then fuck it lets do something else.
because that's what it comes down to. i really don't care if we're not gonna be a part of it
i was trying to steer away from this line of thought
still
yep
because they are bad
unanimously
and so i hate them
i don't know if you have a reason to hate the hresvelgs, but i do
we don't know chad either
i said fuck the hresvelgs
and i don't like em
yeah
i don't like either
my issue is that we don't gain anything from that. if we're not gonna run why stick our hands in it?
: P
dammit milo we were almost not fighting
go for it
this shit's airtight and if it doesn't work out im gonna get suuuper pissy
?
what should we do after next session
lets keep it simple
plan for going forward
instead of not saying it and believing that it was the best thing ever and then getting pissy when it doesn't work out
that's why i say my stupid bullshit outright so you guys can shoot it down
i was hoping to kill two birds with one stone, but it doesnt sound like it'll happen that way
i muted parsa in my head
anyway milo you were saying?
pretty much
annnd muted
that isn't do nothing
that isn't do nothing
you make a plan then
i had to explain the plan to you three times
suck a dick parsa
kinda throws a wrench into the plan
aw fuck
no i didn't read that
while you're being arrested
if you do it at all
he won't
nope
i suppose we'll have to talk to the lord prosecutor
but even in human form he won't get away with killing three guards who are showing up to arrest him
with the assistance of the archbishop and archmage and whoever else they decide they need to send
you fucking moron
no
at which point we'll tag along and kill the dragon
and then he'll kill more guards and it will spiral out of control until they send their heaviest hitters
yes
and then they will attack him for killing the guards
and the dragon will obviously not be chill with getting arrested
hopefully, yes
and ruin the city's faith in house riegan forever
we're just using this as a means to kill the dragon
but he'd already be dead by this point
no
whilst excluding house hresvelg's involvement
conducting investigations on joseph riegan and revealing the successful plot to kill morozov
yep
yeah
yeah
and the riots
namely the mass murders that are currently going on
he's waiting for all the other city's major problems to stop being problems
oh
he hasn't had the time to do anything yet
3 weeks is not a lot of time
not 1
*3 weeks
so he's got a lot bigger shit on his plate
and during that time we broke a bunch of heretics out of prison and the head of house hresvelg was assassinated
it's only been 1 week
yes
answered
now william is the head of that system
because he was overruled by a faulty system
with the real evidence that he already has
have the city execute the dragon
go to william grey and peg riegans crimes on new disguised riegan dragon
ok
shut the fuck up
have the dragon disguise himself as riegan to take over the house
go through with our ambush
3 step plan to killing the dragon
clearly you didn't read the conversation
yes that would be the best case scenario
after killing a dragon
even if we do lose
i think in general it could never be a waste to simply put our names on that board
fair enough
we know that
he will be
by killing a dragon
^
we could try to play the videogame
it literally just got announced that it needed to happen like 2 days ago
because
not really set how many men this race is
it's also
and we need dwarven representation in stem
fuck the hresvelgs
chad
oh it'll be fun
you don't have to agree btw
i don't appreciate it
stop giving him credit for my amazing plans
that was only my plan
that was never milo's plan
no it's not a point. whenever we get to the point where we want council seats i will just start offing them.
so yeah
i still haven't acclimated to the character swap
it's rly funny that you're saying that
parsa i think
im sure we can find a way for the captain of the guard to fall in the line of duty at some point
that's retarded
it's not like you lose an election and then NEVER ever get to try it again
with one person
no
i see no reason as to why we can't try for the election both times
i see no reason as to why we can't try for the election both times
but REALLY
not really
other way around and i wanna smack you.
also, if you share, then flame, i'd take it on the nose
miss me with that gay shit
he just talked shit
yes, he didn't
there are no perfect choices that will make everything simple and fit into a neat little box. so what, is your solution to not try? fuck off.
at least if lautrec runs into issues he can kill his way out of them.
me fuckin neither.
here's my counter argument. parsa, do you want jett to be the one representing us in the council?
i was saying take notes on the shutting up bit
honestly, much worse.
but i tend to think of mikhail as accident prone at the best of times
if not i'd probably vote jett
only if
somewhere along the line i started capitalizing shit and i feel like an asshole now
i think that securing the archbishop's vote for miles would negate any issues that he might have running. I also don't think it's right to assume that it'll never happen unless he renounces Fina. We already know she has a vested interest in him, but we've been avoiding seeing exactly what it is she wants. Meira doesn't seem like the type to only offer ultimatums. She was like that with fuckin Iago, but Iago was a brick wall. If Lautrec is willing to not be that for twenty minutes, I think we can secure a vote.
i will answer the question then continue shutting up
is this a direct question being asked of me?
or anyone else
oh, im shutting up until parsa gets a chance to respond
^look at this parsa, take notes.
so i'll shut up and let you talk
that said, i've yet to hear an any step program for anyone else
i think my 2 step program is pretty good, but i accept your difference in opinion
a reasonable one
then it's not a problem
but if we get the archbishop to vote with him
yeah that's the issue
^
on a very sharp downward trend
67
no
personally, i don't think the church has as much influence over this vote as you believe it does
makes it easier on the church since we have a place outside the city for them to gather at
there's nothing ostensibly wrong with worshipping those gods, since A all the gods are dead, and B they aren't explicitly evil.
or something
so maybe we can get him officialized as the go-to guy for old god worship
but glorfindel said he was the wrong heretic
and he shouts fina at every opportunity
the problem is that lautrec has all the subtlety of a seagull
if we can succeed in that we win, ez glap
for the entire conversation
we just gotta get him to go talk to the archbishop and not have his head up his ass
so
but i'm also playing an anarchist
and give a little more room for the commoners to do whatever they want
i think lautrec should be on the council so he can work to loosen the churches monopoly on faith
or 1
to give lautrec 4 votes while you guys get 2
for my doing this
that was the reasoning
well
lmao
two single brackets
it's two brackets
xd
double brackets
i've got a business to start, no time for council debauchery
everyone exept me, baby
or else it isn't a real vote
ok but we still have to go with the classic roshambo to finalize it
we'll rock paper scissors it down from there
cast your votes
i don't know who a quarter of these people are
the rest will be harder
we know can probably commandeer 5 or 6 of those with little effort
i don't think we get to talk to them at all
he's a no nonsense guy. just show him the numbers xd
and william
and yeah, but at least they aren't voting for each other
i only go ahead with shit if i know i don't have to count on you guys
i definitely can't do it alone so im not gonna go ahead with it without a majority vote
oh, yeah that's fair
my deception is dogshit
i definitely can't
well the point would be to not let him figure any of that out
to just be joseph
but it'd be much less problematic for him
he could
pin all those many crimes he's committed on him and have him executed
then the dragon disguises himself as riegan
kill him
we ambush joseph riegan on the road
a 300 iq plan to kill this dragon
i just came up with
oh my god
archbishop meira said she'd be down to help with that once the city's fixed, right?
that's as guildy as it gets
hagan is the master of fuckin coin
i don't even want to be captain of the guard
as much as we want jett in there i don't know if we should put jett in there
i couldn't do it
if the knight is also a folk hero
so can't be sure it'd be officially recognized
not of this country
not of this country
knights are nobles
we just make him a noble
it aint that hard
lautrec the b e a s t
who summoned an angel of Authority right in the center of the citadel
LAUTREC
lautrec
we're lesser nobles of a house that was thought destroyed
i mean we'd eat that guy alive
and be charismatic enough for them to believe us
do we need proof? the elemental is gone. now we need to go in and say we did it
which we did one of those things
liiiiike killing a dragon and excising a massive water elemental
unless we did something wild
but not anyone else
we can probably account for the hagans voting on us
the guard captain will be voted in by the council
we don't get to vote, but it's still a vote
it's a vote
the captain of the guard sits in on council meetings
it wouldn't be real hard to say we landed the killing blow
if we have, say, a knight who can do a shitton of damage in a single turn, waiting to ks that thing
that might boost our chances in this captain of the guard thing
if we get it on record that we killed a dragon
just saying
where there be dragons, there be kobolds
...
fuck em
an incarnation of pure evil
he's not people, he's a dragon
why not do both?
one tidbit of info doesn't make an asset
i thought he was just an asshole druid xd
we need help
and now he killed our cook and i think he killed some kids
say hey, some guy applied to work for us, but he was a dragon in disguise
xd
we could call the church on him
...
i mean
honestly if we could find a way to get him to clean up his shit i'd be fine with him living with us
that's nothing
im chill with a cow a day
that's clothing
leathers, meats, milk
fix the economy through alcoholism
we want them happy so they buy more stuff which is why we gotta get the booze flowing like water in daggercourt
means regular shit is purchasable by commoners, and the market improves when commoners buy shit
cheaper leather is good for the market over all
this is some little alchemy shit here
he's an elemental. he could stop disasters if he wanted to
an asset is conditional, but so long as we keep fulfilling those conditions we're all good
that i think you're not understanding
between asset and ally
 there's a difference
and it's agreed to do more
because it already did something for us
no
which we have no evidence to show that it will
i mean you're making the assumption that it'll do that
powerful. asset.
and the fact that it agreed to do something for us.
the fact that it's powerful.
it’s a powerful asset, why waste energy to destroy an allied asset because it’s powerful?
but that’s retarded
i don’t know why you’re insinuating that he’s not playing to character when all he did was make a decision 
a player character
at least hydrius is a problem that’s some 600 miles away from us
everything is a problem
so not our problem xdddd
its not on the map
no
no metagaming, kill yourself
i think this qualifies as that
i like easy solutions to stupidly difficult problems
is there a multiplier?
*bead
i was thinking we have him gulp down the storm beas
idk maybe
thing
the glass elemental bead
we have something that will feed him enough to fix this issue immediately 
i think theoretically
bring the paladin
1v6
so we gotta kill him
i’ll give you this chance to not fuck up xd
as in if you fuck up, that’s it.
im a fan of the one chance process
maybe we just tell him to stop under the threat of an imminent asswhooping
instead of giving this murderous being presents right away
we may have to kick his ass, also did we ever research him?
yeah so it’s hydrius
milo you gotta get your pet elemental under control
so it’s hydrius
do we know?
where is this weird shit happening specifically 
wonderful 
yes 450% increase
this is why we fix the economy 
what the fuck?
4 fucking silver for a motherfucking crossbow fucking bolt?
sounds metal
can divide by 4 multiply by 3 ez
house funds can def handle it if jett is willing
i haven’t tried since the promition to officer
and yeah i think we can make that happen 
most likely 
maybe give advantage on a roll if that’s possible?
i’d help someone else with whatever they want to do on week 2
obviously under a fake name.
week 2 i wanna see if one of the petty members is willing to get themselves hired as a maid or janitor or something for the riegans, so they can find the vault.
for week 1 i scout out the guard routes outside the house and plant some traps between the riegan house and our safehouse?
k
but i think it’ll be fine so long as we wipe them
i don’t think so
just to throw more shit at joe
i want to
but yeah we kill miren then let him in on the plan
it’ll probably be easier once miren is dead and we know what he’s heading back with
because he isn’t going to come back for a funeral
so if nobody knows we did this right? that means joseph isn’t going to die
but he didn’t want to fight those 700 troops when they were on the road and i’m sure he doesn’t want to fight them in their own home.
i assume he’d take it if he was sure he could just kill joseph and then own the place
why would a dragon especially a green one ever want to put itself into a situation where it would be forced to hide itself and pretend to be some old faggot’s kid?
but its got some gaping holes
i think it’s a fantastic 200 iq plan
so he may not even go for it, since he, being a dragon and thinking like a dragon would assume that the whole 700 troops would come running back
also now that i think about it, he already knows their flags and standard
2 i think it’s safer to have the dragon with us when we kill joseph
i don’t know where their treasury is for one
i don’t think that an hour is enough to get a big enough haul
me neither
like the riegans are not the volatile parts of this plan. if anything goes tits up it’ll be the dragon first
i mean he’ll see us carting away all their valuables while he’s on his way over and then he’ll realize we cheated him and kill us
which is a major selling point of the plan
and also trying to subtly replace him means i can’t go and steal everything from their house
though honestly there are too many variables 
probably not
oh
as soon as joseph gets back, the dragon just eats him
that’s dirty
...
this whole thing is likely a small part of a larger plan to overthrow the duke and put elliot in charge of the city
hresvelgs are their allies. house gloom are their allies
probably 
miren riegan is his right hand man in pretty sure
miren riegan is his right hand man in pretty sure
he brought 700 men left 300
he’s en route to the other town
he’s already gone
alright i will put the transaction into r20
we'll ask her
a trinket offering or maybe a bit of blood should do.
it probably won't be that bad
like and respect
i think that's a good way to get pin-cushioned in your own home by every thieves' guild member in a 100 mile radius.
so maybe we should do something for her before she starts giving away company secrets
she doesn't talk to most people, but after you get your rune done people will be asking about it
the officer's den, which is where the rune station is, is haunted by a ghost that you can only talk to at around 3 am
or not problematic, if you know about it
25 and i'll also tell you about something in there that could be problematic for you
it's gonna be a pain in my ass to keep all these fiending ass thieves out of the officers room so they don't see your rune.
and your spear xd
fuck that i want 30
i want 25
xd
i gotta take what i can get
i only charge you money for these things because we don’t get paid wages
how many off weeks before next session, btw?
oh
That tends to be something of a liability, especially when it comes to making normal business transactions 
well i don’t particularly enjoy being publically labeled as human garbage
i’m lawful evil
i freed them from their holding cell
i didn’t traffick shit
at least in character 
and 50% of that would be shit i told you
truth? you don’t know the truth, you only have like 5% of the information 
i can twist anything to fit my agenda
again net positive from a moral standpoint
presumably that means that criminals are being handled quicker
if anything, i think that rings in net positive 
Tf? the worst thing i’ve done was take some slaves who had already been enslaved and deliver them back to their owner. And then i sent the guard captain after that owner
tf do you do?
it just so happens that i am the poor
i give to the poor on a daily basis
i’ve done more for this city than you have by pretty much any metric
that’s actually teeming with native cannibals?
you wanna go to a long forgotten uninhabited island?
yeah
we should raid it
there’s the tomb of saint vix
that sounds dank
actually 
always
good job lucia thank you
also
if you want to explore that
theres certainly rubble
there apparently are no ruins
dota 2 fair and balanced?
nice
also the way you said that made me believe the opposite 
them teeth are fucked up
skype picture
..
what the fuck is your picture, parsa
yeah but you guys are part of the crew
otherwise fuuuck no
maybe for 20 gold
im not letting that goon ass motherfucker into my guild
does this mean 10% instead of what’s on there or on top of what’s on there
huh?
or blew the riegan’s stockpiles :)
yeh this
i think for a wizards tower its 8k gold
we can put them on that, it’s not like we can afford the actual upgrades yet
right
i thought they were building houses for our farmers
oh lol
hiring people should aid the economy, too
we can hire those
you guys use them
eh im good
ok
wait eric does that stack?
i gave them a house
they’re tools, not people.
^^^
normal guards can be handled, though
if they look like strong guards then we go around them
i mean we wouldn’t be looking for fights, we’d just sneak attack them while they were completely unaware in order to knock them out
way easier to avoid them when they’ve been blackjacked and stuffed in a closet
or maybe make some sort of chain to toss everything into a cart
get in, help take out guards, grab shit and haul ass out of there
also giving gold to npcs is like at least 25 percent of what the game is about 
but you don’t have to
mission critical employees
not npcs
also i arrived at work, eric and didn’t have a moment to stop until like 11pm
after that it’ll start paying itself off.
i need enough cash to cover yhe first month’s payment on a 3k gold loan
15% goes to the petty members who would be coming as support and backup, 35% for the trust fund
if nobody else is gonna help with that, i’m keeping 50% of the haul for myself.
but i’m gonna stay behind and steal as much as i can
jett wants to leave his note and dip im pretty sure
yes
also
do it for yourself, im gonna be running recon on the house and the roads.
do it for yourself, im gonna be running recon on the house and the roads.
fuck my phone keypad man
after we rob them blind and kill their prodigal heir.
*which
wich could be paid off next month if we blew our stockpiles on it
like is there some sort of formal competition where lautrec can go and smite himself to victory?
do we know how the captain of the guard is chosen?
right
shit man
2 when the church is complete, 3 when the establishment is built?
what level is our castle?
maybe lucia could do a few rounds of muting people’s resentment for the church
idk man
can you try and ease the city pressure while you’re performing, parsa?
he can back it up
put lautrec in there
lautrec
you can work on that
sure, i mean so long as the ones we aren’t hiring are farming and getting taxed idc
sure, i mean so long as the ones we aren’t hiring are farming and getting taxed idc
yes
but not if i have to pay it
id be down
that’s fair
a month?
jett you wanna spend some of our cash on upgrades?
but cool
thats what im doing
take out a loan for your tower, asshole
i see
or 1 plat per pound?
or 1 plat per pound?
dam
is this a weight of platinum or a number of platinum
where else would it be?
...
another reason we shout clean out the riegans house when we kill his kid
but i think we should find stuff too
i mean. We do.
im still correct
spell scrolls are magic items
well
lautrec is strong as hell
namely the wizard
back to delivering packages
ok im good now
bah
instead of later
which means i need to go get food now
so 7
eric can start whenever he says he wants to start
how am i supposed to focus on my deliveries
and he's loud as fuuuck
my roommate is fuckin dming a game right next to me
wrong group
oh im retarted
:0
and it should stay that way
as much as i think we do, i also really think that shits none of our business 
so instead im gonna be playing norman reedus’ fedex simulator
see i said i’d download it when i got home but i just found out that i can pick up death stranding tonight 
ah
dope
that shit will never not be busted.
just respec into a stealth archer if magic isn’t working xd
oof
oh wait you can’t cause it’s not skyrim
for authenticity
break out the ole ebony blade
sounds dank
?
are there viable builds outside of “stealth archer”
fk me im downloading it when i get home
wait there are new builds too?
in what?
frankly that first part is not my problem, but that second part is deeply offensive 
also found out that she’s trying to steal a book that contains a ton of words of power, and she’s started her own illegitimate slaver’s guild that is recruiting thieve’s guild rejects and other undesirables from the city
she gave them a book bound in literal human skin
that we can use to contact her
oh, in campaign, my boys finally met up with syvanna
lmk
aight
do any npcs respawn?
i like that, honestly 
sick
oh and does enderal clash with other mods?
are there new races in it?
no roleplaying in it at all
fantastic game
cause skyrim is a shit rpg
that's pretty sick
oh im retarded
for mein kraft?
keep it
all your shit is in a box in your new room
if parsa’s really going with the wizard, then I left a message in roll 20
ok
*3rd part
fuckin nice
also
when is the second part?
i know it’s not adderall
idk wtf you’re doing running yourself that ragged
shit man, get some sleep and ignore my bullshit then
midterms or finals?
if you’ll have more fun playing this character, then that’s fine, all you
fine im not gonna argue that.
iago was a good character 
this aint it boss
i know you don’t care what i have to say on the matter
i paid your bail so you could play your crazy serial killer 
i want my fuckin money back
b r u h
iago’s gone?
ok
WAIT what.
wait what
jett said yes
but surrounding yourself with a bunch of ridiculously good looking people makes you more valuable as a member of high society
i like having all that information readily available
i just don't want to split the screen space between that and any of your faces
whatever he is, i really don’t care. All i want is the jewelry.
fucked up druid i knew it
100% chance he’s up to no good.
90% chance he’s a warlock, 5% he’s a black dragon sorcerer, 5% hes some fucked up druid.
cause im the only one of these idiots who actually wants to put money in your pocket.
can i get a full wing?
why does he get a full wing, huh?
Hey morozov
Hey
if jett agrees i will complain to him about this guy getting a whole wing and my only getting a room until he does something about that.
if jett agrees i will complain to him about this guy getting a whole wing and my only getting a room until he does something about that.
if he was less than a 9 i’d have said no.
we have a guy for the floors anyway.
fine.
I’d say “are you gonna fix that?” while pointing at the spot on the floor.
i mean yeah
also rate out of 10 for me
after that bullshit stunt?
did he fix the floor?
but one ally seems manageable 
we didn’t for the soldiers
i changed it because it was wrong
why is that the emote for this face? who fkn knows
: ^)
: ^)
esp considering the conclusion we reached 
it didn’t need to be brought up
yeah sorry bout that
i can’t say anything definitive for next week today
your call man
because you had to open dota to play it
auto chess was not the best
and i praise slannesh on the reg
but if you want to play with strangers and don't want to let their grubby hands touch your cherished dice
that strikes me as profoundly retarded
fuck china and all but damn if that diablo 4 cinematic wasn’t sick as hell
i didn’t think they’d release it so soon.
cool
the elements one?
i guess tft is still the optimal autobattler
sounds like shit
i see
also you played it, fuck man im sorry
the game is worse so you can care even less
exactly 
no reason to feel attachment whatsoever 
at least there there’s just no agency at all
i feel like auto hearthstone would be more fun than regular hearthstone 
if i liked diablo that woulda had me going ape
if i could run everything in borderless windowed mode i would
that shit triggers my ocd man
and the main problem there isn't skype, it's just that windows 10 UI has a massive bar on top of every single window and you can't hide it with anything.
and i can size it down but the more i do the shittier it gets
maybe a 10th of the screen
for me it'a masive fucking popup
even though it seems like that
i wasn't bitching about the number of tabs
don't want to displease our lord and savior
slaanesh, whoops
i play warlock, dude
a lot more dicks or a lot more asses?
doesn't mean i want to do it
if you shove your own dick up your ass, you'd feel better about yourself
hey parsa
so i keep everything else open and click on it when i need it
i want the chat open 99% of the time
i don't like navigating roll 20's menus
not really
me magnum brain, me keep 200 handouts open at once
i have my character sheet, r20, skype, spotify, and then like 13 other info tabs that eric made
and having it open
*i like
you can, but like being able to look at it
and i don't want to devote any of that space to skype
dnd already crowds it up with the multiple tabs that need to be accessible at any given time
have to deal with limited screen space
laptop plebians
my screen is too small
easier to get into character when everyone has a face
exactly
and because you can whisper to other players
because you don't have to type
irl is always better
you don't want any miniatures?
lul
to eric and i
there's one on pico that's decently close
perfectly legal character
i'll just play my thief
now i want to try it because i want to see that for myself
that's some retard shit
really
holy shit
i think 4 sets is the optimal number
that i still want to try
well it's a completely different experience
i want to try it at some point
AL
and don't share
you bring your own
borrowing is cool
but having extra d6s and d8s and d10s and d4s is very nice
you only need 1 d20
ok lemme remedy that
i guess
and 4d6 with 4 d6 dies
but there's a vastly different feeling to rolling 4d6 with one d6 die
i bought my set for 6 bucks yeah
but you kinda need more.
i have only one set.
allows one to dab on the plebian gamers in your group
rolling up to a game with that nice ass box
the packaging is also a definite selling point
these are pretty quality
ye
way too much
exactly
but then you're a fiend
for yourself to collect
i mean you could use a vpn to adjust your ip and send it to a hotel in another state
basically
it's like are you really gonna waste your time and the govt's money with it?
and buying second or third hand
that's one of those things that's hard to impossible to actually keep track of
lmao
which is a pretty major selling point
these have sharp edges though
it's not hard to find good looking dice sets for much cheaper than this
in comparison to other well made dice
no i mean
that's dangerous
i do however like the scaling on their backing model
them shits are baller
i may even back just for those red dice
it goes on for the rest of the month.
i wasn't sold until i saw the list of color options
if you want to look at it like that, sure
good looking dice sets cost 10 bucks
and persephone's seeds is fucking sick
the colors have names
again, profoundly
as cool as those dice are
it's 50 bucks for one set of dice
if you have this rune you fuckin suck
greater rune of the bonobo
yeah
muscle wizard
jew pravaal.
you watch
my next character is gonna be the same character with a different name
Xd
now they wanna find dad to beat him up
mom became crack addict so they were picked up by cps
father loxodon took off to buy a pack of smokes
that sounds like nigga shit
fuck HKA
no i don’t want to be trained by china
Majuul Brooj
LOL
but not because of anything miles said, just because monk gay weeb
same
this
we don’t want monks
monks don’t get anything 
xd
damb i guess i’ll go fuck myself
for all the shit i talk im still gonna get the rogue one, cause its objectively better than not having it
are those ua class enhancements available 
that’s certainly not what happened
im mad that he didn’t die
is the gist of it
parsa broke curfew and lived
eric you can deposit the insurance money into our trust fund
ok, glad that we got that cleared up
and i will swear on my father’s grave that i do not and have never known you
i will be there to witness your execution
well do it again, pussy
i suppose
maybe you’re just a lucky bastard who didn’t die in a horribly bloody fashion 
maybe you got off easy as a first offender
exactly 
all actions have reasonings. I just want to watch parsa’s characters die so im gonna keep arguing for that eventuality 
it could be that that specific guard was tired of the bullshit iago personifies and wanted him gone, or he really was just lazy.
but nothing done there is deterministic of anything else
i talk all this shit
i mean here’s the thing
cut the wood bits off his face and mount them on your wall
yes kill him
so long as the world reacts to his decisions in a manner that is reasonable and brutal and bloody, it’ll all be realistic.
the character is retarded or has a god complex or whatever, that’s on him
no it’s not. his character is his character
as does the bail
and it makes sense
that him being knocked out and dragged to jail in the 1v6 is realistic 
i should state
dude he was dead the second he stepped outside 
parsa is black
you’re forgetting one crucial component here
eric, eric, eric
otherwise i feel like i just got cucked
i wanna see them die
so if someone pulls some stupid shit
i care about equal and opposite reactions
i don’t care about him making new characters
nobody likes the death monk, for some reason
parsa stop making crazy kamikaze characters
is it a lazy river of murder? or a murder waterslide?
depends on how fun you make the murder
xddd
thats a bool ass move
nah getting beat 6v1 in arrested makes sense, letting him go after he casted inflict wounds while in your custody?
i woulda gunned you down in your cell in that second fight if i was dm
parsa you played that like a fuckin bozo
in this campaign 
jett hasn’t used hex once
warlock is a better class than wizard
and it seems like all casting classes are being offered this you can replace 1 spell on a long rest thing. Do people really have that much of an issue with having to make fucking important decisions? another reason i don't like this shit it's bitchmade.
but they did add more options for font of magic. I guess I expected them to do less?
i didn't read the whole sorcerer one
clerics don't need smites, though.
the one thing i can get behind are the expanded spell lists, because a lot of the spells in there should have been offered to the classes in the first place
unless they were trying to cut down on multiclassed characters?
like, martial weapons for monk is retarded and doesn’t have anything to do with why you’d pick the class
when it comes to the classes i think it’s more important that they have mechanical niches to fill than it is for them to be balanced. Like you’d choose wizard if you wanted to have a vast array of spells available to you, but you’d choose sorc if you want to make more creative use out of a smaller array of spells. If the proposed changes had more to do with that i think it’d have been cooler
Idk i guess it’s not worth arguing about 
it just makes sorc into a better wizard
and there’s already a built in failsafe for picking spells you don’t find useful cause you can swap spells on level up
part of the fun is in the decision making. making builds with limited options and shit
switching sorc spells on long rests fucks so much with the class
no.
the rune fighter is dope
i did like the new subclasses
everything is optional im just saying i personally don’t like it and wouldn’t use it.
it wasn’t but there weren’t fifty layers of shit you gotta pay attention to. If i wanted that, I’d play 3.5 e
it fucks with the balance
the ua class features 
i don’t like any of this shit tbh
ok
homebrew gay
f
but the expanded invocation list he's using has good options that i need to double check
gonna pick up better book next level and then maybe mask
and it did its job
i needed ac
mask gay
but im gonna swap that out next level
and i still have armor of shadows
agonizing
but when we need damage e-blast all the way
i'll spam it when we need someone to not get hit by something
no
yes
had to pick up eldritch blast
but i need to wait until i can get another cantrip
it would be nice
yeah i nearly took it
OH
oh
oh as a tiefling?
blood curse?
leave then come back and end call
respect
chad move
milo
milo u got beaned
WHAT
and idk why we're asking about more free time when we haven't found out what happened with week 2
i don't care about complete accuracy in my jokes
i was about to break into song
u sure?
and no one is real
nothing is happening
guess we've moved on to greener pastures
but nobody else is
well im on it
dead assed truth
not even
unless i write them down xd
i come up with names quick as hell, i just don’t remember them
it involves dragons and getting lautrec laid
fuck you parsa i got a great idea for a oneshot
and you guys can play it if you want
to remedy this i will come up with a oneshot on my way home
but if your vote is for videogames i don’t want to force you to dm
so thats where my vote will be 90% of the time
but im also a fiend 
my vote is for dungeons and nibbas
also i vote a hard no on risk of rain
i won’t be home for another 30 mins
wow kys
i’ve reassigned my race identity. and now i am austrian
i’ve reassigned my race identity. and now i am austrian
i am no longer black
i have an announcement 
fellas
i could
you deserve it
if you fall that far and are dumb enough to not have the spell feather fall
well
fuck hard caps
C:
which is not accurate to real life
that does mean that fall damage caps at 200 feet
yeah
without that hard cap, you'd be doing 30
sadly the fall damage maximum is 20d6
but it still works
so the suggestion doesn't end early
well you'd dimension door up there and drop them, THEN cast fly
then cast dimension door and fly and drop them
you use suggestion, tell them to follow you, take a short rest
but it's pretty easy to set up
that is the best way
geas literally deals damage when they aren't following your orders
he has more than you technically
yes
i don't think you currently have any spells you don't use though
in fact with your level up you can always drop a spell to take a different one
suggestion is broken
i still don't know why you haven't taken it tbh
you'd need suggestion
and you can't cast both spells on your turn
cause that only works for a turn
not really
handling it in a 1v1 is pretty much the dumbest way to go about it
i mean yeah if one of us rly needed to die that's fair
and drop us?
and the thing you're bringing has to be willing
you can't bring someone with you through dimension door unless you're carrying them, i'm pretty sure
?
Eric I’d like to spend the week doing 2 things, 1 i want the petty finding Syvanna’s new location, 2 i wanna see if i can talk to the lady in the mist, to see if she can guide me to one of the cult of the White King meetings.
Eric I’d like to spend the week doing 2 things, 1 i want the petty finding Syvanna’s new location, 2 i wanna see if i can talk to the lady in the mist, to see if she can guide me to one of the cult of the White King meetings.
it’s fine, i don’t have much stake in this one, but tell me what to do and i’ll do it
lick my gooch wood man
hehe
maybe i’ll cut off all their fingertips and they’ll be put on greenhouse duty until the debt is paid.
if they fail to meet these terms we can promise them only a fate worse than death, because it wouldn’t do to murder a follower of the one true goddess
until then you’re stuck with me.
i get off when i finally get to bathe in a gilded tub full of platinum coins
i get off when i finally get to bathe in a gilded tub full of platinum coins
delivered within a 3 month period 
we have to make it very clear that we’ll only save them for a promised lump sum of 150 gold per person
maybe from their families?
well they probably don’t have much
by the way do you think we could possibly extract some money out of freeing these prisoners?
im not morally ambiguous, i’m very clearly morally deficit
currently 
i don’t want to
thats if i wanted to
4d8+20d6
sorry
auto crits cause you’re unconscious 
i’d stab you 4 times in your sleep for 2d8+16d6+20
if i wanted to kill your character i wouldn’t do it in a 1v1 duel
also parsa stop trying to incite pvp fights
but lautrec is also a heretic
not even up for debate
milo they are heretics 
ye i’d probably have to run indoor so 
which is kinda nutty
but 150 range would be a flat roll with the advantage 
that is true
good thing you can sneak attack with a crossbow 
also im unkitable
4 chances to hit that
also 4 stabs
high
action economy is in my favor
or we could not do any of that and instead systematically kill or rout out every family in daggercourt until only I’m left and then milk everyone else dry of every last copper until they cant even feed themselves without my express permission
that works too, i’ll see if we can get a hold of whatever it was Syvana was using on those cats
or we can ignore all that and just keep attacking rich people and trying to take their stuff
sell shit for cheap to jobless peasants until they can get jobs
time to fix the economy
buy up cheap houses and turn them into bakeries
gotta strap on our hardhats and set to repairing city infrastructure
damn
is nathaniel applying that tax to the income from the business he’s holding for us?
nigga.
theres a tavern that’s much less burned than everything else but the rest is just people’s houses
theres a tavern that’s much less burned than everything else but the rest is just people’s houses
x d
which is genius and something i definitely should have thought of
so he’s either only going to hresvelg employee homes, or much more likely they burned the houses strategically to buy the things they wanted
this was directly after the riots ended
he had a list that i took from him that listed the properties, resident’s names and a specific gift for them. as well as a small description of the person and the items they lost
so apparently while i was out in the wild doing what i do best i came across a hresvelg agent who was going around offering to buy some of the burned houses
dropping things from 300 feet in the air has never been so easy
there’s bound to be one or two that are in the red.
if the market is kinda fucky we should see about purchasing more businesses 
that makes everything much easier 
oh
how do you know this?
what?
and to maybe try talking this one out
to not go in trying to kill people
all the more reason
and didn’t kill anyone?
you actually went into the church?
you actually went into the church?
who’s to say the lower levels of the church aren’t a massive maze of retarded ass corridors and empty rooms
totally not dead prisoners, right?
we also have no idea where to look for these uh
fair
yeah i didn't think it'd be that easy
lol
this is great
look at lucia, pulling her weight
oh wow
for the purposes of paying my bills i guess
i want to commit larceny en masse
mental note: never allow parsa up to the third floor of the house
exclusively?
which is to just kill the archbishop and run this “side with powerful psychopaths” train as far as it’ll take us
it just works
and cause combat balance with an unbalanced party is hell
since we aren’t using xp
you’re 7 im pretty sure
how much dps does your spirit guardians do now that you’re 7 parsa?
agreed
just cause high ac
im pretty sure if it came down to it, miles and parsa would win the 2v3
l o l
which are kind of two massive gaping holes in an otherwise flawless plan.
the only logistical problems this creates is that parsa’s character is a retard that tried to get her to kill herself, and Lautrec doesn’t associate with unbelieving swine like her
if next session is breaking out prisoners from an experimental sub-sect of the church that the archbishop likely isn’t condoning, its probably gonna be much easier to do if the archbishop is on our side.
i just like to try to pick and choose our friends to try and minimize the amount of shit we’re burying ourselves under
im pretty sure all of them want to blow lautrec anyway
but with where we’re at it and what we know, it shouldn’t even be difficult to get the church on our side
it’d probably be safer than my other idea
and coming clean on the whole thing
i still think that we should first just try talking to her
but don’t be stupid and say something like “we stole this”
we can probably set up an appointment with him to see about that
did all the ones we broke out find their ways back to the estate?
nice
actually, since after playing jett’s character and looking at his sheet i’m so sure that we don’t have the money i’d rather just spend the week hanging around with my old harbor friends and committing a shitton of petty thievery in the market district 
and i don’t need any help
agreed 
i don’t actually know, i just assumed so because eric said “alright” to milo
things.
for uh
eventually i’ll have to pay parsa’s character to stoneshape and mold earth a deeper basement.
lmao
basement will be storage for now
1st floor is an inn, 2nd floor private rooms, 3rd floor would be a safehouse for us and the petty
I don’t know if we have the money for it yet, but can I see if I can start remodeling the house?
haha never mind
...
and just straight ask her
well i guess we could target her for sending
k
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
can i go back and do it?
i forgot to ask about the drugs those slaves were on
SHIT
and lucia would know that afterward
just saying, i did know that she was evil and that those slaves were what we were recovering
parsa's new character is pretty based, milo
alright
it may be important
ever tell if hydrius was evil or not?
did your research on the guy
milo
gotta hit the za
i doubt it'll get here on time, but im getting pizza
everyone but milo
sorr man you missed it
we played at 8 this morning
actually
1
5
just open youtube 
wait
yeah i think were down
yeah that sounds nice
well then fuck offa my team
pass without a trace+spider wildshape is good stealth
could definitely use a fireball blasted through a window at some point 
so nvm not better
i think the plan was for her to help from outside
but lucia has shit tier stealth so it’s probably better
sorry, parsa and i
was going to help jett and i
and how much is entry?
what kind of bands?
ye i see it
sludgefeast is more metal
it’d probably live longer if he found something else to call it
sludgefest sounds pretty metal
but magazines are kinda phasing out
i used to like that one
like juxtapos?
what does it carry?
releasing a full magazine?
that's pretty dank
im working literally every day but, so that’s cool
yeah
sorry
fuck
we'll also need to buy a big tarp or something to put over the cart.
everyone cool with the roles?
so i guess jett and miles go together, parsa and i sneak in, milo provides support, but with pass without a trace he could probably come with
so i bought blank ones and painted them red, cause that's my color
those were expensive
no
i bought some masks and big ass cloaks for us to wear over our armor
and not get caught
we should do everything we can to make this go smoothly
we can just steal his notebook and shit to figure out what he's been doing
and i don't think we'll have time for that
i still think we should do that
if your nibbas got swatted like they were looking at anime tiddies, then it's very likely
but maybe
and i doubt he's the same guy
well killing the guards and recovering the cart would be the same thing, the guards should be guarding the cart, since it's being held in their quarters
sneaking into the room is about not arousing suspicion
yeah you gotta kill the guards to recover the cart
me/milo?
team sneak into the room and kill the dude
miles
team recover the cart
well what team you wanna be on?
hmm
jett do you have either the spell suggestion or charm person?
it'll take a few months at least to turn the house we get as payment into a functioning business
and i don't think we'll make that kind of profit off the job
but we don't have that kind of money
the safest bet is buying our own ship
because it won't
we should not plan on everything going perfectly though
on the ship, at the very least we could blend in with other passengers and their carts
and there's the issue of the cart which would be a dead givaway
both would likely be heavily guarded
it's definitely scryable so we'll have to toss it into the river afterward
oh so we could just take williams if he has it on him
yeah
and will likely be incredibly dangerous
which everyone will notice
orrrr use my harebrained pully system to fling the cart up to the bridge
we can try and use the teleportation circles, blend in and take the ferry
and it makes sense
yeah it's expensive
so water walk covers getting on
is the only problem
we have to get a cart off the island
well
ok
it's also boiling hot
but the river in daggercourt is that
i don't know the logistics of waterwalking on white water
would it work? probably not. but it would be incredibly fucking cool if it did work
then we attach the cable to our reclaimed cart below, and push the second one over the edge to rocket ours back up to the surface
what my thiefly fantasy is, is to lay a huge cable over the bridge and tie it to something big and massive like a cart filled with rocks
NOW
so i think we need a differen't way to transport out.
we have to sail in, buying a ship could be a 3k+ venture
that's fair
unless someone wants to have this boat built over the past week
i would explain the plan, it also may not happen right at the beginning of the session
that's all exceptionally good
idk, you guys decide what teams you want to be on
that might actually be better
lmao
probably end up still giving noxalas the gold per month
well i’d 
alright 
did noxalas leave any introduction behind for this fucker?
no dagoth ur?
oh
actually nvm i don't care. not cruel enough to do what i had in mind
is mary a seamstress for the merchant guild?
fixed
now i do

i don't see that
idk why that other shit was tacked on
no need
a duke's eye named William Grey
afterward
afterward
maybe light the room on fire
regardless, we figure out where our mans' rooms are, we book it there, kill him, grab what stuff we can, and jump out the window.
and hide their body
friends works too, but then we have to kill a random servant
cause either of those makes finding where to go much easier
i have no doubt that every door will have alarm casted on it, so we either santa ourselves in through the chimney, or we need someone to dispel magic our entrance
unless you want to try and plow through 10+ elite guards.
the evidence will be held in the guard's area of the citadel, so jett and i will have to cause some sort of alert to draw them out before you go in
so i've gotta commission us a medium sized boat that i definitely do not have the money for rn.
their entire family
not just the perpetrator btw
was bout to say
ok so we definitely need the teleportation key regardless
it’s a full cart, right?
oh, eric did the petty manage to find out where he stores confiscated stuff?
lets just take a boat and have our elemental buddy help guide us in and out
we're fuckin good
WAIT
2 and 3
no
well
i think we need to do a combination of all 3
so we've got 3 options, obtain a teleportation key to the citadel, 2 get like a 300 foot rope and shimmy down it, or 3 take a boat
but apparently there isn't
i thought there was a way down to the citadel where our guy lives off the bridge
fuck
so
i don’t know what you did to have to edit “thank you sir” but i will remember it and use it as ammunition at a later date.
tf
anyway, im up for making moves i say take them
same
ok, def on recovery duty imo
but he’s also a sorcerer and idk if we should have him on his own.
on title stealing duty
*not with jett
if parsa’s sorc can cast invisibility, i think it’d be worth to put him with jett
or just obtaining them
that would involve actually working smart to buy profitable properties and staffing them well
but we could make plays
we don’t have fuckin money for that and all the other shit we gotta do
we need a coat of arms or smth
and house livery would be pretty dope
Penny will keep correspondence with noxalas in the form of unmarked parcels sent to him containing pouches of 10 gold.
and then they’ll look at you funny and go inform their pigshit masters that there’s a skeevy guy trying to kidnap them
if you don’t respond, your character will spend the week doing hard manual labor knee deep in pigshit while whispering “Hey, how bout you come work for me, eh?” to the other dirt people working knee deep in pigshit
but i will wish him good luck help if i’m available 
im not gonna make plans for parsa’s own shit
as for week 2 i guess i'd be sending the petty on reconnaissance, just to find out where everything is, then i'd be getting the cloaks as well as some bright red squares of cloth that I can fold into bandanas. then maybe i'd do a bit of burglary on the side to pay the petty for their work.
idk who the better choice would be. depends on if you're killing the guards or not.
jett or milo can go recapture the cart with miles
it's not too hard to adjust the groups
owl is dope
owl?
i respect that shit
oh
krieg if he was a wizard
this is like
this looks fucking awesome 
ok
ok
i like noxalas both in and out of character though
i mean if you’d rather play that, do whatever you want 
so
well the party isn’t pressuring you to do it
so don’t worry about what they’re saying, play to character 
cause im just that nice
im gonna kill that man regardless and share the spoils with you regardless 
nathanial is a great dude, just an all around wonderful gentleman 
alright i can’t force you, buddy.
so yeah
probably first
i’d tell you about the murder thing
with lucia ready to blast me an exit if necessary 
murder team is just me
you’d just be recovering the stolen goods
also you wouldn’t be on murder team
yeah
really sells his worldview
and the violence against him is a good point imo
*mental
he’s not an incel so much as a dude with some pretty serious memtal disorders
i guess
yeah a nibba do
like shit man
im actually about to see joker in like 20 mins
this movie is really fuckin good
fina.  FINA.
also fuck women and kill people
cool thanks guys
*after
i hope i don’t look like an incel serial killer going to see joker alone a week aftee it’s release
i do too
Rat life is the best life man
like kids hiding in curtains lmao
behind illusions
but like silent image can let you hide in plain sight anyway
damb maybe someone can cast it on you before you go in
do you have invisibility?
you get access to invisibility?
thats quite useful 
Not too hard to get those.
and no, but i was really thinking we’d just wear masks and heavy cloaks. 
I’ve already concocted a barebones plan. We split into two groups. One group, probably Noxalas (if he’s in), and Lautrec get rid of the guards and recover Sylvana’s confiscated cart of goods, while I, with outside support from Lucia go kill the fucker in his sleep. If Jett is in he can be a part of either group, OR he can go in on his own and see if he can steal any unsigned property titles
so i think Lautrec is gonna have to do this mission in drag
so we’re going to have to disguise ourselves 
ez glap
yeah
i just read the lore tab for them, her mom is the fuckin archbishop
which is great
but eric rolled high on my perception check i guess so i saw through her disguise self
and she’s apparently a pretty decent mage
She’s a member of one of the big elvish families 
So hopefully by doing this we can establish a bit of a working relationship.
The job was given by Sylvana Folen.
sick
no i mean your metaphorical “in-ness”
that changes how much I can say about it currently 
Is this a I’ll help 100? or an i’ll help 75-99
if you want no part in it then thats cool. Just pretend you didn’t hear anything and don’t tell anyone about it.
ye it is sike
LOL
:0
Which in itself is not an evil act.
if you don’t want a part in the bad stuff, I could still use your help just locating him
Part of the requirements are to make it look deliberate 
im going to leave a calling card.
a rumor?
that’s got a built in route to the guild
And we get a sick house out of the deal
Cause I got a contract for it
But I’ll pay you money
I can almost assure you there is none...
which means A, he’s very well protected. B, he’s likely a very pious and by the books individual. C his whereabouts are likely public knowledge 
he’s not just a govt official, he’s a dukes eye
ok well
well
gotta ride the wave
:^)(shake)
Does that count?
Im uh, sure he’s committed one or two major offenses to god in his life?
Gotta kill a government official.
so, not sure what you guys have going, milo and parsa, but who wants to help me commit first degree murder?
same?
i think we gotta take the crew to the tomb of saint gemi
so that we can all sing gemi’s praises
thats a pretty suboptimal example
because 
are you using lucia as an example of the clergy?
do they?
and not a historian 
well its a good thing my character is an uneducated gutter rat murderer.
while parsa rages internally
now
yep
otherwise you’re not in character 
we have to treat him like an honorable and wise saint who saved the world 
when we talk about gemi in character 
so basically 
yeah
so like
and Yew was possibly the worst person ever made
the gemi of the other campaign and this gemi are not the same person at all
cause the lore is different
eric memed us
well
but that about sums up everything 
i was gonna say something 
yeah
good
chaotic
but you coached him into being able to draw the sword
we were supposed to make that prince a shitty king so the humans would lose
except you didn’t follow through, you bastard
then he was just as much of a massive piece of shit as the rest of us
lmao
oh
i don’t think gemi qualifies as someone who knew what they were doing with nearly all decisions 
Xd
yes
he ended up not helping me fuck up that prince
and he didn’t actually follow through with all that
its more like he got strung along there
im of the opinion that gemi really didn’t know what he was doing when he was “conspiring for human genocide with immortal psychopath eladrin.”
also gemi would probably hate you
yall can do whatever you want
but thats just for me
the river nuke is a last ditch effort 
and idk about you but thats penny’s hometown
so if he shows even the slightest sign, we lie about taking him to the ocean and drop him into a desert
but if/when he becomes a problem down the line everyone in the city dies
uh
he doesn’t seem like an issue rn
but yeah
it was in character 
but i don’t know what the fuck that thing is, or what propagate means.
you wanna come up with some spellery shit you can
im thinking in character 
eh
that way we can keep our fuckin mini nuke happy
cause the thing wanted to see the world and shit right?
every time we go someplace out of the city we bring it like a sample of the water found there
though
i know how we pacify it
i think
also eric can't he do that for off week stuff?
the damage is done
i think it's a little too late for research
i...
if he's slotted for execution or something we do that first
bet
and then smash his face in with a silver arm?
out
gotta actually go in there and break him oiut
regular guards can be bribed, but those religious nut types are fuckin crazy
fuuuuuck
we gotta break him out of church jail
so not normal jail
OH
a negus really do be existing
oof
to get locked up?
whatd he do?
interesting 
oh
if we don’t have that, then jett what the fuck.
so i think next session we should start with a meeting in the war room
I have matters that may be pretty pressing to handle
Does it involve murder?
I can help
i’d rather do that, smith can wait, sor miles
ok
i could definitely turn that house into an inn
cause
or can that happen offscreen?
do i have to go visit the asker about the grandma’s birthday job in game?
well
penny's down to throw this dude a surprise birthday party
and maybe a merc company to help guard the crib while we’re out on businesses errands 
we definitely need artisan smiths
if you can find a manager for it im down to help buy it
sounds like an ez clap
i mean
i see
a messaging spell?
is it a letter? a person saying it to us?
what is the context of this message?
the grandfather's house
ok
do you require assistance in obtaining these things?
not for the house or anything but for yourself
in game?
you fools figure out what you want yet?
what’s everyone’s plans for the short term?
very fair
definitely 
if we’re not in the city the idle weeks don’t make that much sense
that said
more control
for a week
choose
lets do that
yes
maybe your skype caught downs
sounds gay
and nothing?
cool
but slow
On my way home
im gonna be like an hour late
every once in a while, and when they get bored of that they fuck.
all they do is fucking kill each other over and over
ganesh could suplex the mortal plane but doesn’t because he’s chill and is all around a pretty great guy.
shiva kills shit by thinking about it
kali has an infinite number of heads and arms and she uses all of them to literally rip people to shreds and eat them and shit them out and then breathe fire on their shitty corpses
vishnu just flies around on a golden hoverboard and fires sun lasers from his legendary bow at unsuspecting retard mortals
are insanely powerful psychopathic mass murderers
except ganesh
all their gods
i just said hindu mythology is the most badass
no
a silver arm with which to praise the sun?
kali disagrees with your opinion 
aomfag
xd
not as badass as hindu mythos, but close
celtic mythology is fuckin metal
and we’ll do it again, too
nah these orcs gave me a sweet cloak so my allegiance has been permanently bought.
honestly, i think non combat oriented magic items are the most interesting ones
d o p e
that flower is fuckin strong 
so that works
if jett is good, which he would say if he isnt, then that fits the 1 mia
if it’s more than 1
if it’s more than 1
and mini session 
don’t care
 yeah i can
i can probably 
we can’t invite nobles to a trap house
trap mansion
agreed
can we make that a priority after the orc thing?
which means we need a house with less holes in it
so we need rooms for em in the house
im gonna be recruiting boys from the thieves guild
oh jett
cause its just the camp
wherever we want, right?
sick
or chaotic retard?
Lawful evil
so
so like
you can be a warlock for a major god
also warlocks aren't inherently evil
^ this is very correct
I mean, I’m not gonna say that I’m not open to hearing offers, but I doubt the fucking massive orc with demon horns and goat legs is gonna waste his breath making them.
Fuck that guy.
the guldan orc is a gay bonehead orc, we don’t like him and we want to kill him when we go fight him.
im just saying it’s a possibility 
I love em
we’re already appropriating their elementals, next we just train our own soldiers like that and we can be launching another subjugation campaign in less than 20 years
ez clap
he sends a bunch of dick wagging humans to curbstomp you
thats what happens when you forget to appease your creator god
then they probably deserved it
if humans could do it
we came in and decimated them
idk
eh
not that it’s on us
we do have a ton of iron that needs smithing
i did
fuck you milo
okay then, blame milo 100%
nice
oh
Much more fun
that’s true
Feels better knowing we were fucked from the start 
Alright then
w h e l p
x d
So if we’d just shut the fuck up and walked around it it would have been fine?
wow
true
so it wouldn’t have affected them
the spell
they put themselves in shrouds of darkness 
got all the shit
in fact i think milo was the clear winner of last session
gemi 2 has that
yeh
and fight like an orc
just had to do what it tells you to do
wasn’t all that bad tbh
i noticed 
yeah
did so much damage 
that storm elemental was fucked
this is true
Jett i feel
so unless either someone gives way too many fucks about them or we fuck up the deadifying of all the riegans then we ought to be fine
the plan would be for all the riegans to be dead after that
well
at most you’d need to buy a new one
yeah
nah you can pull it out and shatter it
we could always walk inti their house and drop both
that too
for a fuckin minute 
free sneak attack baby
yeah and its fucking dank
so like
but im enjoying playing ooga booga with the orcs
tbh my character would just want to get this shit over with and get back to daggercourt asap
xd
plus, i don't have a god that might get pissy with me for doing it
same xd
gotta bring civilization unto the heathens and infidels
make gemi proud
ay
yeah
you could probably convince the orcs to follow the light of gemi
now that we’re respected by the tribe
this friday isn't session, though, right?
i see
oh
what you mean reschedule the other one?
?
gl jett
oof
i think you forgot a word there man
uh oh
he's got 1 min
well he said 15 mins at 6:48
i know where you live
if ur late ur fucked kid
woo
 ok back
imma be on time as fuck
on my way back
it really do
you got nothing 
i don’t have enough money to look like i was selling weed
you wish
oh fuck
don’t have a crew
you
i’ll take you ez
i left the heater at my dad’s but
what you gon do
what you gon do
ok
not as bad as it seemed
im getting through it tbh
x d
gotta run to my job and get my money 
and then
got like 6 boxes to unpack 
here
yikes
7 right?
hah
i’ll go to amazon hq and beat the shit outta the temp
like
if it doesn’t show up tomorrow im gonna fight someone 
x d
so if it’s late I’m gonna be distracted as hell
except my bed is being delivered at any point before 9 pm tomorrow
well yeah
nah
yeah
very clean
and cheese the game
and then use that dinero to buy op items early
you can just be a farmer?
and maybe?
he works for the Rogans
ok shit
he’s an officer, right?
yeah
I don’t think I’d have met him though 
almost as edgy as me
he’s rly fuckin edgy
suck my diick its magic
then a solvent that dissolves acid isnt retarded
AHAHA
does the word choice agree with you your majesty?
how about this, an anti acid salve, parsa
they do have a guild assassin, whom is apparently a pretty nasty one
i was just saying words
i don't know.
except instead of hiding inside the gifts, we're hiding in the gift givers
trojan horse that bitch
have giants swallow us whole with only necessary gear, and then have them smuggle us into a protected area
maybe if we got a solvent that protected against acid we could actually do it.
death pinatas
and then bursting out like pinatas.
i like this plan of hiding inside people
well we hit his wallet, clearly 
in a 100% legal and ethical way
burn him to the ground
route 2 for jett?
sounds good
or was it we only have a month to complete each option
so we need to complete both options anyway?
mo money mo problems
options 2
2
nada
nope
classss looool
and im cool with 8 start
i like fridays most
actually don't answer that i don't even wanna know
why not?
so wednesday's fucked for me
yeah
i listed only the days i can't do
which im sure doesn’t work
unless we start sunday at 9
rn i can do any night except wednesday, saturday and sunday
it’d probably be easier to just hire couriers already heading there to go post notices on the city gates or something 
it’d probably be easier to just hire couriers already heading there to go post notices on the city gates or something 
if theres an office we could probably pay like 10-20 gold a month to just have them keep doing it
But infiltrators from the guild sounds pretty expensive 
Sounds pretty dank
sick
so we no longer have to buy wood to house those farmers
oh I forgot, parsa got us some carpenters
and like any bank, I’m assuming any funds within the vault may be used to pay for house needs whenever they need to be paid?
if they call, our asses are so clean they sparkle
but it appears not. Very good
if you had a problem with me paying my bills then we’d have a problem in general
so like
that 15% interest rate is nice and shiny
I also owe the guild 300 a month if i want to keep my shiny platinum membership 
yeah, bet
fair enough 
does this apply to money that we have taken from the vault?
for allowing third parties to use money and using money to break national law
I see a few red flags for myself specifically 
change them
The numbers are gay and make me want to shit on your bed
is the percentage what we get or what we give?
it's not that I don't trust you, I just don't trust the you from 5 years from now.
i'm going to need it in writing and signed with blood though
% cuts work
Juked him out by climbing up and down a chimeny, then dipped out.
It went fine but when i got into the dude's office it triggered an alarm spell. So I had to either jump out the window, or fight through his guards.
so watch out for that
also we found out that miren riegan is a bitch who likes to fly around at a hundred miles per hour and blast people with fireballs
ye
to hire someone
maybe visit the fighting pit or something
that's something we've gotta figure out in game then
alright
so us knowing may not even help
probably for a month
chasing down orcs or something
but we'll be out like
to watch over it and make sure nothing too bad happens
you're probably right
it's basically thieve's guild property
but i don't think he'll have a very easy time of it
he can try
essentially what we're saying is
yep
nobody knows that
well its not ours
whatever's good
so idk
well it came to parsa and my attention that we weren't actually getting paid for anything, so i was thinking of ways to handle that.
i'll be honest, this is entirely just an incentive for you guys to make and carry out plans and shit. because eric doesn't want to keep laying hooks, and i think it'd be cooler that way as well.
maybe jett thinks this is a terrible idea, because the money is technically his. but if we unionize, and maybe go on a couple strikes, i think he'd change his mind.
any time you suggest and complete a job or make a purchase that adds a steady flow of income to the house. You can dip into that source of income for your own funds without it being a loan or anything
and i specifically mean us working under jett
for how we get paid
i've got an idea
and im taking all of it
we're making 800 a month
you guys fucked up
*anyway
eric wants to do it anyeay
im game
i think we can plan something worthwhile. Maybe we break into the Riegan house and steal their ledgers?
but im down to come up with some other shit to do
personally i don’t want to go on a crusade to cleanse the trade routes without the whole squad
alright then
next week, i guess
well then
you sure?
:C
5 pm till 7:30 next day, idk man you might be gay
yeah it works
southpark?
?
🤡
ah fuck
and i count myself lucky for that
i don’t have that emoji
jesus
holy shit where did you even find that
(puke)
all yall nibbas gay
shits locked in
woulda been acceptable 
shoulda said something before 5pm today
thats it
you just fucked up
you can’t argue it
and nobody said shit
the statement is everyone but me
you def gay
in fact since you didn’t answer and that means you agreed with me
conversation was over
its a whole different day
kinda too late boss
i mean you didn’t answer till now
no answer is a yes
everyone in chat is gay except me, right?
how about we test it
you know
for the record, I said probably 
thats a jett question 
wait build?
wis
moon
circle of ass
for full items kappa?
milo’s taking levels in druid?
maybe 
should be good
but drinking it is kinda too far
She would take it, if it was just being offered in like a bottle
if that was the option
Penny would not drink the demon jizz
this right here
^
well u gotta kill the demon boss
or test it on homeless people? for science?
we can't just bottle it up and sell it later
?
i mean do we have to drink it right away
so do i get negative inspiration?
i don’t think i had inspiration 
LOL
thats degenerate. left shift purisim
you use RIGHT SHIFT?
actually thats just the same
you can’t rebind anything to p?
idk that’d rly fuck with me over time
get ctrl+vhucked
wait
get phucked
x d
you have no p key?
lmao
skype hasn’t been giving me auto responses and it’s rly tilting the fuck outta me
skype hasn’t been giving me auto responses and it’s rly tilting the fuck outta me
it’s about being a complete retard and seeing what happens 
yes
it’s probably laced with heroine and pure crystallized lsd, but i’d still take that shit over seeing what happens when i say no.
would anyone say no if doom guy shoved the boof in their direction?
ez pz
we take the offer
so its possible we can just run up and stomp them
but also like we’re level 6
seems like we could use some more boys
can’t expect them to leave perfectly good bodies just laying around 
giants be giants
well
i wasn’t expecting that information to be available, just would have helped rule out monster attacks
alright 
mostly
or the people for that matter
is there any news of the animals being eaten?
so yeah we just exterminatus the whole route
oh
for the firegarde guys to be behind it
not gonna lie, its very likely and probably the easiest method for them to be hijacked
i meant straight line between the mentioned places
well straight line wasn’t literal
i prefer being as thorough as possible tbh
yeah
but thats not as thorough 
and just kill them
alternatively, we could disguise ourselves as the caravan and see who attacks us
we can call it operation: pest control
lets just go in a straight line and kill everything that isn’t the spice caravan or a township
alright easy enough 
so there’s something camping around there
needs more jpeg 
nah just bake it some more
too much jpeg
can’t read on phone 
x d
we do have his big ass regular sword
yeah but the sword isn’t made of the metal i don’t think
he was also a very big guy
thats true
idk i just want 19 ac
from a mechanical stance i don’t give a fuck about your realism shit
well its still armor
well than 4
oh
increase my ac by 1
i can get daggers easy
tis good idea
woulda clapped his ass if he tried to fight
i still socked his pussy friend
kill shit with your hands
weapons gay
bonus action dash makes -10 speed worth
except i wanna melt that armor and make it studded leather
same
x d
x d
other than that i’d be down to take you nibbas on a quick heist 
but afterwards we should check the available properties and see what we can do
it’s probably bandits, but we gotta figure out the routes his spices take, and clear them, cause once they’re safe and shit stops getting found, the riegans start losing money for no reason.
so  loren doesn’t go bankrupt 
find out whoever’s causing those caravans to go missing and stop that shit
well we have a goal rn, right?
too many damn dogs on the street 
too many damn dogs on the street 
traffic 
wasn’t expecting so much dam tra
cause i gotta walk my dog
im gonna be like 10 mins late
where were you?
yesterday 
sniper then
fucker
ok fine start at 9
you drink pee start at 3
you're a whore start at 4
ehhhh
i could have done more rhymes but
i think 7 is a good time to start
ok
suck my dick start at 6
xd
fuck jett start at 5
or 7 or 9 i guess
im good for 6
same
fuck energy drinks just do coke
hahah
holy shit you're gonna get so wired
never had an energy drink?
i’ll find some shit to do on friday then
sickk
🖕
im okay though
fuck you give me parsa’s campaign 
xd
i almost did the same exact thing, but with absolver
also im on time
why would sakurai bless us like that.
it was already the perfect stage
megalovania is on pilot wings
guys
7
TOKEN
i get off work at 3
not too hard
i mean on time is 7 right?
i’d like to not be killing myself
so
which means i gotta wake up at 5
i gotta be in studio city at 8
cause 
it’d be very cool if we kept it from going longer than 11
oi bout tomorrow 
chaotically neutral
that works too
even if we're just buying like the most useless chattle?
maybe one eldritch blast hit and a gold piece for buying the slave
"damn you hit me, that hurt, hol up while i kill that slave i brought with me"
so you basically just wanna kill one of them every time you take damage
well it doesn't stack
as long as you're being spoonfed all the souls you're basically immortal
you just ks everyone xd
fiendlock is the shit
what sort of warlock are you jett?
a warlock?
the best class in the game?
are you playing 
JETT
and we’ll see what i can cook up
we get a temple we get a drug racket going
anyway cool shit
i won’t tell you this plan until im in character 
actually 
i wanna build a pleasurehouse on our estate
we’re never gonna get the nobles to try our shitty drugs
where everybody at?
dnd 2 mins?
4
4
and if you guys aren't in the city by the start of session 2 you can just introduce me when you get back to it
lmk how it goes or if anything important happened
ya, do it
just play the videogame
yeah
yep
you guys can do something cool like hunt dragons for coin. I guess my character will be incredibly busy with crucial, time sensitive guild work.
happy birthday, eric
sorry was accosted
all i can say is
it’s unfortunate 
we got a fucky labor day schedule. I work at 4 instead of 9 am
I thought I’d be able to make it fine but I won’t 
paid dlc? i’ll give you 20 bucks
can i have exotic metal masterwork weapon plz
theres a link somewhere but it’ll take a bs amount of time to find it
hilda’s pretty sick i only flame to get you tilted
ok work now.
No problem!
Yep.
kill them too, we’re level 5 pc’s to homless skrubs we’re basically the second coming of christ
oh wait you’re a neutral good cleric
you kill him
never is
always seems like a good plan
never a good plan
or buy drugs and shove those up their asses
or shove it up their ass
buy drugs 
i mean what do you do when you’re a poor boi in mideval times with just one copper and nowhere to hide it from all the other poor bois
Hehe
i never lay my fingers on that filth anyway, you never know where it’s been.
bottom tier dnd coinage always seems to escape me
coppers
oh im rarted
bronze is a penny
if gold is a dollar
can we use pennies instead of bronze
christmas must be saved, yessss?
white king needs 100 souls, 1000 pounds of flesh, and 10000 shekles to save christmas 
cleric eh?
What do you play?
always have a backup 
what does it matter if the me pile is a little bit bigger than the us pile
i mean theres an us pile and a me pile
great
ok so if jett pulls too much shit we all get excommunicated and stripped of rank and title. and then excecuted
and then executed 
if jett pulls too much shit he’ll just get excommunicated and stripped of rank and title
i mean assuming the game is semi realistic
true, miles will pay me on time
oh god
xD
thats just it
ferdinand is off-brand sylvain
bitch i am ferdinand von aegir
i think most characters would benefit from writing like that
executed flayn and then seteth
but i still executed that bitch like the thot she is
i like flayn
big tiddy dragon mom
immaculate my ass
Xd
only want her dead cause she dickrides nonhumans
shed be fine if we recruited her ass
hilda sucks cause she hates black eagles and thats just it
even marianne is a better girl
hilda has bitch lasagna
hilda bitch 
*globe
my levin sword+ mortal savant byleth slaps from across the glove suck a dick

*monarchon, valor, throne, ursovk
*monarchon, valor, throne, ursovk
oh shit i forgot how cool all the high tier enemies from the faiths section are
or else we might have to go and massacre them all
hope the church of seiros isnt run by nonhumans or anything 
what a memelord
galaxy 
like super mario galaxt?
isn’t the planet shaped like his head?
fuckin gemi chance
we’re all simply smelly peasants
or wait jett is the noble
so that makes just makes sense
you’re a noble right?
gets easier if we build a temple, right
bools be boolish
aint hard
my mongrel character picture is perfect 
time to go back to the drawing board
wait i just realized that Missy and Eao are the same exact character, fuck
a pound a flesh for a pound of silver sounds like an Eao style trade deal
I get it
i knew it
HAH
xd
all the first characters
is it gemi chance
and
did you already finish your character?
don’t miss it or you die
yes
esp with already being in class
esp with class on the horizon
? a two session week?
but friday is a good day
in which case i’ll go do that
except when they need covers
im pretty much always good on fridays
tues at 7 am suuucks
how variable is your sched, milo?
monday is doable tho
my subday schedule has me at work till 9pm
Oh, have fun
i think both interpretations are accurate 
but thats fair af too
whenever i hear meme fiesta i think camping
yea
eric’s birthday though
Huh?
i thought 
Next week
Yet.
skype sucks
that is true
xd
my way aint cancer
my way aint cancer
so you can find it in whichever place skype stores it's downloaded shit
now it should open the compressed file
samecord didn't work cause i don't wanna pay for discord with more emotes
lets try this
discord usually better about these sorts of things
i'll put it in samecord
xD
(sad)
propaganda
skype wouldn't let me autoresponse anything to that
agreed\
aint that hard
then right click it
put the file on your computer
open it with something else
ew
it just works
so im surprised
it's like a 500 page pdf
lmao
it's the strongholds and followers book that eric's using
yeah
hopefully this sends through skype
here
oh
i’d expect nothing less of araki’s self insert character 
ofc
xd
ic
oh
at the best bits yet
not even
im only on part 3-1
i don’t know who that is
SSS
literally tier 1
just keep watching it you pussy
if you hate it
you fuck
don’t part skip
gwyn right
she likes horses man
nah ingrid is cool
*trash
and trasg
but i got her late so she’s underleveled
yeah
i like to do as dimitri do
but i spent most of my time power leveling all my units
you can do that if you want low turn runs
is the op combo imo
lindhardt and lysithea together 
my linhardt learned warp by chapter 4
completely broken
is op
lysithea
oh
and he’d never come back
i thought you could let him die on a mission 
oh
thats awesome
you can abandon dedue?!
blue lions route?
*ez
but passed catherine cause game woulda been too ex
coulda grabbed shamir and catherine too
cause i could
i grabbed both
she’s too easy
dorothea wants it too bad
xd didn’t even get to look at the models
oneshotted annette too
idk
so
i oneshotted her in timeskip
oh
she thin
the opposite of thicc
hilda is
cause she completely ignores you unless you’re golden deer
i know nothing about hilda
did jett ever beat golden deer?
lmao
you’re absolutely right there
ahhhhh
^^^
edelgard is best girl
im no longer friends with christina
kill every last one of them
jotaro
joseph kicks ass with tiny balls on a string
to the true nigga joseph
but doesn’t hold a candle
like don’t get me wrong jotaro the shit
joseph is life man
im on part 3
so far
part 2 is the best
is better part 1
part 2
no
you should
I concur.
Best
YES
and milestone keeps everyone even leveled
xp takes too long to calculate 
better
milestone
good question
missy "reform the slums and restructure the lower classes so the poor can make a living off of honest labor." o' bruke is ready
okay
ok
or is it more, a bunch of rowdy boys wandering the world looking for shit to punch?
where we gotta get in there and deal with assassins and people trying to slander our good name while we try and get rich and build ourselves a small kingdom.
you're running a more political game
so just to be sure
you know what must be done
milo
you
ok
as long as the city has a seedy dockside underbelly i guess it could work
Xd
I am definitely not
im there
ooooof
(y)
and if we’re just gonna start doing eric’s in a couple weeks then yeah we should probably also drop it
if half the players would rather not then we should probably drop it
well opinions?
yeah
i’m down to continue yours honestly 
i don’t think that was talked about 
*6
so yea
we do have seven players
thats an early level
in the early levels
you’d have to use lower cr monsters
true
you could balance it out by only giving the ac bonus to melee attackers. and keep it so that all ranged attacks still get disadvantage in melee and you can’t counterhit with spells unless you have war-caster
archers and warlocks with eldritch acog scopes are broke
it is
actually wtf am i saying 
i don’t think that’s very punishing for melee
good
so basically everything attacks back when it gets hit?
welcome brother, bless up.
looks like we have another fan of fire emblem combat in here
Good then
might be a bitch to try and remove that ai though 
ah very clean
I hope not
chadonia seems like it might start arousing some uh, unwanted, but totally warranted suspicions 
Alright, let me know
at least one that someone doesn’t already own
yea it is
and you know me i only play iron mode
without dying
i’ve yet to find both a planet with high enough value and the ai’s to govern it at the same time
yep
yeah
rn my main goal is to see if it’s possible to wipe out every single faction in one run
understand, i play star sector like a fucking retard
like
that said, i’ve yet to get commissioned by anyone in any runs so i can’t really say anything about the longer term benefits 
i just wanna kill shit like the pirate i am
but i dont like having to work for space dad
idk i think it’s probably better
and my biggus niggus run died when i forgot to turn my transponder on when approaching a hedgemony world and the cops gooned me
ofc chad gigahad is more successful though 
or a name
i don't have any motivations or backstory
i’ve been literally on it all day
i left my computer open on the r20 page before i went to work this morning 
Let's get it
No need to be
I am home
come home
milo work gay
You are very welcome
Home
like a week in advance 
if we planned for it
id do an in person thing
in person on the computer kinda ghey tho
with pens and paper and dice n shit
dnd is better in person
im not saying you can’t do it in person
fair enough 
an online app
he sent us
i can’t come if thats the case
but
i still didnt know this was an in person thing
Gotcha
sure
i don’t think you have anything to worry about if not
AM?
or are ya just disorganized
do you have a file for your dnd images?
is it on your computer somewhere?
so im not even gonna send it to you
i deem that shit to be broke as hell
upon taking a further look at the ua artificer
nope
actually im just gonna play the same exact divination wizard as last time but with a different name
but if that's a no then im playing divination wizard again
i'll send you something from UA
OOOOOOOO
OOO
O
thanks
rolling dice does sound like a good way to buy your points
now that you mention it
well actually
and it'll tell you
use a calculator
also the cover photo for this campaign is very good
?
when you get a sec could ya hit me with a character sheet
hey parsa
that one was fun
fuuuck
darkest dungeon is best dungeon
they just made me want to kill myself
i liked battle drones
you’re an asshole
shadow monk assassin rogue?
i guess i’ll play a warlock 
and i can’t go simic shit
i can’t go matt mercer’s gunslinger
so
lmao
and he’s gonna 4v1
i’ll use something else
i’ll use something else
*am
but ok
i al referring to that
simic order is the shit
why not?
yes
if that’s the case
i may pull something from ravinca
actually 
fuck yes
so i can be a gunslinger
can i be my homebrew gunwizard?
can i be a psion/rogue/death cleric catgirl from weebland with the power to change color at will?

ok
nigga
at that
look
we downs
yes parsa
especially people still using skype
people are stupid 
cause
but it’d probably freak users out and make them leave
my guess eric is they can do that
Guess
What's your name?
that shit was great
i did his dungeon
hes a good dm
im down
parsa wants to run a game?
lmao
just gotta do it
he had no other options
get that money
miles yes
Genius
but it’s 15 bucks and the game is good enough i think it’s worth dropping the cash for
you can
yeah lmao
4
4
4
shoulda spent that money on star sector imo
but
nice
you got ror?
and it sucks dicj
Yes, it is
otherwise the hedgemony runs up on you while you’re distributing your heroine to the impoverished masses and they rape you with emps and flac missiles
like the massive bitch you are
then  hoof it to your target and dip the fuck out before anyone sees you
then turn off your transponder 
you literally just follow sseth’s instructions and hide in an asteroid field
theres no other way
cause im bad at managing flux
i just wanna get good at the combat
agreed
im just fkn with you i didn’t do iron mode either 
bruh
didn’t do iron mode
oh lucky fucker
you’ve started a colony?
just upgrading my fleet and killing anyone that runs up on me
im a slow boy
no
while i sell drugs on the black market
i just take whatever missions come
none yet but i guess i hang around the hedgemony cause they were closest to where i started
(yes)
:O
this makes me happy
this is good
(smile)
(smile)
(smile)
star sector is the shit
unless you really need the money
keep that shit
nooo
hmmmm
whoops
*star sector
real sor but lost sector has me by the balls
my nigga
ah
maybe
i can come for a minute though
i do have to work tmrw
fr though 
What did you expect?
nope
this is pretty accurate 
only if you want to dm
are literally my favorite thing that i've found this year
these san andreas dubs over other games
bruh
so in a month someone takes over?
we won’t break your arms and legs
this is a good reason to slow campaign 
yes it is
yes
is that really the worst thing that could happen?
Huzzah!
don’t answer that
is it wrong for a nigga to wish sexual fulfillment upon his other niggas?
but y’all negusi should do it
well im busy
ok
this a sex thing?
is
Everyone
at like 3
and i got some shit to do w/ my brothers pretty soon

no
Thanks anyway!

caenis is a thot
and it’s more to torture parsa
cause he okayed it
and fucks women cause pussy is too good to deny
he fucks men to protect himself from the evil female influence 
so incompetence is right off the table
and also im pretty sure none of my retarded plans have failed yet
just how he gets it
that’s not what he wants 
?
Correct.
on ross
he just wants to fuck bitches and make money
but instead of all that returning to hell and killing his enemies 
ngl miles im playing that npc concept as a pc rn

Thanks anyway!
[1563917940] Eric Huang: milo dming high is how we ended up in court

&lt;&lt;&lt; nigga
no only eric and parsa did
that was just the za
And bacon.

nope
same?
does milo want to dm high?
That's what I like to hear
same
same
What's yours?
ah cool
wassup?
At all
maybe not in this city
that works
Are you sure?
milo you fuck
game ended right on time
im here
it means i got really lucky
and that motherfucker hard carried me to the win
last night i got a game where i got a 3 star assassin voli with youmuus, shiv, and bloodthirster literally moments before i was going to be wiped out
im gonna play more tft then
sweet
it happened
it happened
but
i wasn’t ready for it to be a good game
that said if we do 8 im just gonna play tft
i have to work tomorrow
my vote is on 7:30
which works best for you parsa?
7, 7:30, 8, 8:30
and between those we choose start times in 30 min intervals
7 at the earliest 
im gonna go and say 8:30 at the latest 
no
alright men, we ready?
we're gonna miss prince holey rosslick
ok
im gonna straight assume that's a nah to making it
did michael say he could make it?
I suppose.
i planned nothing
that was a joke
i'll dm
well then fuck it
there becomes a point where it aint a choice
idk
held captive by drug-fuled peer pressure
ya bastard
plan things before the day of
the true culprit, who we should really be flaming is jimmy
it was fucked
we know how saturday was last week
well
it was back with your campaign
i never said i could do 8 i said i could try
this isn't a job
everyone gets 3
2
real life &gt; online
i didn't realize you were still there
Yeah, pretty much
xd
and get on call
have a glass of water
oh
go hang with jimmy
well wtf are you doing answering these messages 
well wtf are you doing answering these messages 
lmao
oh
whats early?
On the floor
I hope so
i have internet 
and my shit work
i can
eh i guess
cause its not like it’s a bad tool. and the people who want it most likely already realize it’s a fair deal
may as well just have the one option 
it’s a shitty tactic is all
yeh
im just saying that the price difference between 25 bucks a year and 5 bucks monthly is massive and there’s no reason to buy the monthly version 
*yeah i have no problem with that
yeag
i mean the services are completely different 
i think 5 bucks a month is a lot for it though.
agreed.
the difference is so staggering you've gotta either plan on only using the thing for like a month or 2 or be retarded to get the monthly
are 5 bucks a month or 25 a year
i like that the pro plans
okay
shit
just cause the resolution difference?
why shit?
oof
we in this bitch
i have the power now
ic
is it this inkarnate thing?
wait
it's a website?
he has a lotta shit
anime fish people would have bigger tits
they’re just fish goblins
not anime at all
nah
fish goblins
cancer
in what book?
what?
what a fuckin meme race
kuo-toa lmao
oh
james cameron avatar 
looks like
what's this?
hard agree right there
yeah
i didn't want to blow more than 50 bucks
shit's expensive
nah
&lt;3
&lt;3
i rate it a *7/10 on the enjoyment scale, but that majorly depends on how much money you're willing to drop on a night.
but when you get panties sling-shotted into your face nothing is really all that bad
and i've gotta say, not as bad as i thought it was gonna be
boys i soloed a strip club for the first time tonight
also
and you wonder why i prefer warlocks
One of us
agreed
or let someone else do it
but he doesn't know anything about how routers and modems and all that shit works, so his general mo is to not touch it
he was gonna let me fix the internet
im actually pissed
it took like 20 mins
so i went behind his back this morning and did it
my dad pussied out again
many apologies guys
bullshit for me
soon for you
start, i’ll be there relatively soon
lol
he knows how the character works
start start parsa can play missy
so that i don’t get my ass whopped
mostly just sitting and listening to my dad spew his “holier than thou” bullshit
work on it
reading comprehension 
start without me
i said
thats why
it’ll be anywhere from 9:30-10
missy is gonna look for someone inconspicuous to violently murder anyway 
start without me
cool
you guys can start without me, though 
i didn’t manage to finish before my dad got home and now he’s throwing a tantrum 
im gonna need longer
You better not
highlo is fun
suboptimal 
so im fuckin twisted(noworries)
i completed the round the world challenge 
and im drunk
im fixing my internet 
fuck off
Sigh
oh nvm hour and 50 mins
oh nvm hour and 50 mins
i drink fast
i just got off an hour ago
rough buddy
and its
one drink from every continent 
i’ve been trying to do the round the world challenge 
that sounds like a good idea
so lets see how this goes
also im drunk af
8
ok
8
ok
tentative 7:30
tentative 7:30
that works
or an hour and a half on the bus
which is a 30 min drive
it's in studio city
and ive been hanging with the girls from my highschool
my boss forgot bring my money again 
factor number 1 is not turning out great rn
depends on multiple factors 
I am online now
depends
or midday tomorrow 
late tonight 
and my internet doesn’t exist 
im not home
im not home
i know lmao
30 mins to 2 hours late if course
plan something amongst youselves and i’ll show up
That's the spirit!
cmon chill
im cultivating a harem
im not giving you my hoes
Precisely.
cause
but its hard to go to sm when i wake up at 3 pm and gotta be at work at 8
i’ll try
yuh yuh
work
yeah
it’d be a better story anyway
if you just want that just get the gasoline cut shit
you want good, clean uncut shit better be prepped to pay the clothes off your back for a tiny ass baggie
good coke is next to impossible to get
very easy to get
coke is
and yeah there really isnt a better r word
i thought of that one, but i still think retard casserole just flows better
so i’ve gotta give it to that one
also i can’t think of anything better than retard casserole
I hope so
guys what works for iorc
i was really trying to figure out that acronym
WHAT THE FUCK
bad news is PARSA MONDAY
and i should be done with it tonight 
the good news is i got a working map of how i’ll fix this bullshit
get that shit out my classy millennial chat
but yeah pretty much
i was trying to be nice
i don't want your malleable mind to be tainted by me and these heathens
actually nvm go lurk moar
lurking more gay
watching gay
gay
the thing is i may just put my new router in the house and use one of the shittier ones
the thing is i may just put my new router in the house and use one of the shittier ones
so maybe then he'll take his thumb out his ass
cause i don't play league anymore
cause idgaf about internet speed
and most likely monday by 8
maybe tomorrow
so i doubt i can get it done tonight
my dad's being an uptight bitch about it
miles what're you up to on the weekdays?
9-6 pm?
and i should probably be able to be done with this bullshit by then
monday is a particularly good day for me
i like the idea of making up for the lost time
^^^^^^^^^^10
^^^^^^^^^^10
same
or the day before
ngl we def coulda had this conversation yesterday
great
and the verdict from my dad is i can't do it until he gets back
it takes a fuck you amount of time
so apparently i gotta put spectrum's fuckin router into the garage with the modem, then connect it to the switch, then reprogram the 3 other routers we have wasting space into waps
i think i should go for it
yeah
and then everyone in my house backs me up
maybe i just say the guy tried to show my little brother his dick
for negligence?
how do i sue them
this internet shit got me pissed off. spectrum fucked up the internet in my house
memelo, verdict?
decide now
i'd be quiet for most of the session though
but tbh i can just shit on the livingroom if i need to
it is
i did too
maybe
if anything goes wrong and it takes longer than an hour?
im saying i could. but my dad will stop me
fuck spectrum this shit used to not work like this
so if i do it i gotta do it all
i don’t have a room in the reg house
cause the rest of the house needs access
i can’t just do the guest house
the place is rigged with cat 5 but the idiot ignored it and just wired the house with one shitty router
i’ve gotta redo all the modems in the house and guest house as access points
it’s gayyyy
ehhh
*didn’t
i probably won’t have internet, cause the retard who set up our shit doesn’t know what he’s doing
the spectrum guy who set this shit up is a retard
i think i know what went wrong
oh
in other news anyone wanna help me try and figure out what the fuck is going on with this router?
when i see shit like bruh moment i just ignore it and move on
im sorry i don’t speak gen z
literally any day before today
like
but seriously michael and miles if you had problems with tonight, you probably should have brought that up
and i think its really funny that yall think i don’t know when campaign is
i only meme
that was auto response
wot
parsa
att was ezpz
aside from that, though, spectrum is just being a little bitch
and theres a shitton of cabling that it needs to go through 
in that the area is large
in my dad’s house
my internet is finicky
idk if i can set that shit up before work though
my router arrived already, praise amazon
No problem!
No next week
Huh?
You already know
this was said tuesday 
[1562730764] Milo Amoore: This saturday for sure, maybe next friday but idk it might be saturday depending on my schedule I dont get to know next weeks schedule this early and its random lol

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
Take care
I do not remember that
it says it in the title of chat
I thought it was camping monday
Is it?
can you not make tomorrow?
;(
yall can camp tonight i’ll just be gone
so like
i won’t have any internet in my house
Everyone
yeah
yeah
I can tell
It's delicious.
It's delicious.
eat dicc
we normally do
which conveniently arrives tomorrow 
and then i still have no internet until i install my new router
i think im incapacitated until maybe 4
fuck you o clock
ty
that was a very clear and concise answer, milo
College
if im wrong it’s milos fault
next friday
this saturday 
I trust you
Haha, I guess
Sleep well
Camping
In the summer
i understand now
okay
.
saturday after the switch?
friday now
hold on
oh
so saturday, and not friday 
why would you want dnd the night before your earliest work day?
early days are the shittiest days
what does this mean?
[1562634392] Milo Amoore: I work the whole weekend but I work early enough on saturday to where I wont want to kill myself 

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
but what is this?
friday is good for me
?
Do not remind me
camp pain when?
so
Yeah, let's go
i used to but my aunt took them with her when we moved out. so i told her to burn them.
do you have clubs?
fuckin quoted
“i am greater than a lord... I, am an author!”
yeah
rather than looking for useful people 
and we also wasted a lot of time talking to useless people
not the most thought out decisions
that were
i think some decisions were made along the way
i think it was reasonably okay
Yeah, I know thanks
so we got put in crybaby jail anyway 
but parsa bitched and moaned about it being too easy
we would have walked
btw
rip
cause i haven't seen it before
horizon walker
i die
i'll be fine
but
no
fuck food poisoning
fuck
i heard start
Yeah, me too
this is the worst place to set up a desk
glaring right onto my computer
where the sun is just right behind me
i've got like an hour or so
fuck me
Neigh
pog
I do not have one
What's your name?
afk in gestalt like i always am
im home early
I do not see you
See you then
Thank you very much!
Are you available now?
i’ll be back around 8
but
I work tomorrow
thats the shit i like
yep
cause there’s no way im telling any if you the truth in character 
yall negus can read it but it won’t be useful 
thanks dnd.
thanks milo
and i wanna kill myself
and it took me three extra hours and two extra paragraphs.
i decided to finally finish editing my backstory and post it.
so i wouldn't be good till like 9 or 10 pm
plus im doing shit tomorrow
we aint talk about that
like
i thought it was saturday when eric gets back
tomorrow?
so. not tomorrow
okay if miles can't make it then im not gonna try and get my shit covered
i can probably do saturday but it's gotta start at 8
eric is back saturday
if i don't know before then i can't make tomorrow
so i can make sure my shift is covered
i need to know by like midnight if we're doing this tomorrow
for real though
so
Well, I guess
you can do tomorrow though 
i could get my shift covered
Yeah, me too
Yeah, I guess
i say it doesn’t matter cause players had fun. players had fun=good dm
milo was talking about mistakes made in session 0
so don’t beat yourself up or anything 
very enjoyable 
it was a good session 
i mean
oh
we're from the future, we're better than them
fuck those idiots from the past
exactly
who would we talk to, though?
lul
rip
eks dee
thats crap 
yeah
and worthless
mine is useless
we could
then sell our rare coinage to collectors
as much as possible 
we should get material cash
yes
we go back to our time and we’re instantly important figures, or at least assumed to be the descendants of important historical figures
and then ask for that shit to be recorded 
what we should ask for are badges or something that identify us as the heroes that saved the king and kingdom
which over 400 years will add up to a lot of damage 
there’s also nobody to fix any damage from weathering and age
well time will pass without us, right? so unless we become much more important than we are, there’s nobody to stop some asshole from walking onto our shit and saying, “yup, this is mine”
maybe a single tree or a vaguely interesting pile of rubble
we’ll be the sole proprietors of jack shit back in our time
also, im 200% sure that if we ask for a castle 400 years in the past
Yes, they are
like lets just have a fucking adventure and save the keeps for an appropriate time, cause doing it early and busting our collective nuts on castles and shit right fucking now is kinda gay
the buffs they give aren’t balanced for a level 3 party
save it for fucking later
did you read the part of the book where it says keeps and strongholds are like level 7+ material?
so eric
that’s probably how. it was only a couple months ago anyway
he was on the kickstarter 
kevin got a pre-release
which means i get to keep their parts, for science, right?
yeah
it’s better as David anyway 
im just fucking with you
get your lore straight, nerd
not david
um excuse me, it’s Leane
but you were executed. annnd we didn’t do anything about it
not like, killed
michael we killed your character 
he didn't
no
so
and he has 0 volume control
lucky's watching shit on instagram
this video is a good one
and pretty well balanced
it's legit as fuck
i have a pdf of the book
colville
*god
matt's a fod
matt coleville?
I bet you are
for those who are fuckin fiends
but this will be the waiting call
it's still a 30 minute wait
start call?
Is there?
lets get this bread
nobody made plans
cause i have work
actually im gonna need 8 tomorrow
7pm
r e e e e e e e e
i do
meanwhile im over here just chopping off cat heads and sewing them onto other cats
all you guys with your dwarf lords and world ending cults
i can give yall the summary
my backstory is done
after 7
i meant to write describe like that
i guess i can waste a paragraph desctibing how i like to splice different cats together or something
i didn't actually want to write that much
damb
cause honor demands i have to double it
so how many paragraphs is yours miles?
it’s a meme name
Haha, no problem
You are welcome too
Oh well, thanks
but im not the rat
oh no
okay clearly then, miles just escaped from crybaby jail
xd
fuck
specifically what i'm asking is, would anyone pay me money to see you back in whatever prison you happened to come from?
a bounty on you?
with uh
imprisoned
so
he's on roll 20 rn
well
for refrence
is there a bounty on him?
is an escapee?
lautrec?
this will be great
so we have an eco terrorist, a dude who clearly wants to be a lich, and a self-mutilating dr. frankenstein
(smile)
sick
im willing to share my tent and blankets with whoever's willing to carry them for me.
also, my character is way over carrying capacity, and i'd really love it if one of you big strong idiots could carry some of my shit
*backstory
eric do you have a background?
God bless.
DAVID.
I am sorry too
kms
Nice meme
why uniqlo?
just buy a better immune system
stop getting sick reee
maybe we can get this guy shane to make a character 
ok
or 5
as in tomorrow 
kya
personally 
i don’t think i can make 4
5?
ok
and it triggers my intense ocd
it not being a token is very annoying 
Haha, I know
milo jett can keep it square
milo jett can keep it square
agreed 
I disagree.
yeah
yeah its all cool
but we can help
cause that means you’ll practically have to play his character 
dming while teaching sucks
no gettem outta here
oh f u c k
you’re the boss
suck my dick kappa
now.
(ok)
👌
to make interesting plot hooks out of or not
i wanted something that milo could really fuck with
thanks man
that is my backstory 
done
okay i’ll post it
i copy pasted the backstory too
i decided to go completely unoriginal 
actually just post it
where are you from
i think i can find some good opportunities to go frankenstein on your npcs with this
this is suitably dank
horchata mexicö
i read horacia as horchata
ur not wrong
definitely does
lets fuck shit up
blind run session 0
we don’t need it
my vote is for tomorrow
yes
milo?
yes
Hooray!
Flair
Clutch
i think if anyone's the rat, it's parsa.
Too easy
fair enough
are you trying to get eric to plead guilty to being the rat?
so you're the rat then?
the rat would accuse others of being a rat in order to shift attention away from itself, you rat
who has no need for potions
im now an upstanding member of society
im no rat
i changed my character
and then we decide whether or not we crucify eric's character or michael's
so this thurs and then next thurs
for four days
i mean, ngl that'd be my vote
or we hold off till next week
so thursday is probably best?
oh
btw
i can only do saturday after 9 or so
cause it currently seems like tomorrow or saturday?
how about we take it to a vote
same
uh
you monkeys gotta get your shits together 
so you can slap the monkeys with me
well say your schedule 
nobody else has one though 
i said my schedule 
ya didn’t 
okay
*thursday
... then lets just do thursdat
im okay with thurs
are we?
wait when does bichael get back?
on friday?
(smile)
I am just curious
You both are
Haha, I guess
you mean league of autochess?
plan b for basectomy
only if we’re making a plan b
i replaced the k wit a sh
but
know
who’s plan?
que?
well idk what the plan is
i didn’t shnow
oh
and then next week either monday, or sunday?
so i guess, thursday of this week
Where you going?
are you home thursday?
Huh?
who is santa barbra?
where's LA?
where you at?
wtf u doing not home at 12:30 in the morning?
right now
today
no
okay, tomorrow
okay wednesday
my reasoning: milo probably doesn't give half a shit
actually fuck it, im just going for the first one, second link never happened
i'll be honest, i want the first one, cause of the tent
which background would you rather have me use?
oi memelo
but etan doesn’t do weed, he praises the shroom god
etan does
and im kinda salty
skype didn’t give me any funny responses 
it just hits a lot of small ones
eb doesn’t hit big numbers
sadly, that boi had no stats
would make things less shitty
i just wish etan could land an eldritch blast
i agree
(yes)
no
and mimics
grapple demons
ogres with armor and shields that try and kill you with the environment
wolves that dont just aggro onto the last thing that hit them
goblins that use cover
^this is the better option
or make the weaker shit smarter
i mean you could also just throw tougher shit
we’re not really a high magic party anyway
which honestly i don’t prefer
yeah
problem solved
and make more encounters 
milo make the days longer
basically what you’re asking for is this
in milo’s campaign it would probably work
yeah
but warlocks who rely on cantrips anyway don’t suffer any major loss
wizards can scrape by
tbh
sorcerers get shafted
and the slot conversion ratio is godawful
sorcery points regen on long rest
but your cantrips and class abilities are better
nah better
cause warlock gets a shitton of at-will spells
by far
but what it really does is make warlock the best caster
you have to manage the fuck out of your resources 
of course they do
*cantrips
fuck cantripd
mostly harassing civilians 
harassing civilians 
anything
for instance, i don’t think that if we’re spending a few weeks in a city with nothing major to do, that the spellcasters should have to monitor their slots on a weekly basis and plan out all the dumb shit they might want to do with their magical fuckery
i just don’t think that 6-8 encounters rule is something that needs to be enforced outside of specific moments in a story like delving into a dungeon or a raid on a city or traveling through a dangerous part of the world
i think you could
and then someone sees that shit and thinks “what the fuck is that ugly pile of rocks on my turf? fuck that thing and the assholes that made it” and now you have more shit out to get you
and maybe when you kill those things you earn yourself some downtime to start building a house or castle or smth
i mean even in an open world campaign, if done right there should pretty much always be shit actively out to get you
if your level 7 pcs decide unanimously that they’re gonna trek across the feywild from one city of go fuck yourself elves to another, that’s basically them signing their last wills.
same goes for underdark
and if you’re traveling the feywild at lvl 7 you’re fucking dungeoning
cause up till then travel is difficult 
yeah
and fuck overland travel, post level seven or so you could honestly make the whole thing a skill check
BANDITS RISE UP
or making the enemies kobolds that dump oil and fire burning arrows at the pcs through tiny holes in all the ceilings and walls
like making the enemies move, and ambush the pcs
but you can force the short rest limits in other ways
it also made us plan our rests more
the heat dungeon was better than the drones
the real problem was if there were 2 we were just fucked
but vargach was a tank and a half so it was fine
yeah
but i also wouldn’t have minded if the party wiped
i liked battle drones
and theres nothing in the rule book that says “thou shalt make sure your pcs burneth all spell slots every day to achieve maximum efficiency.”
not all encounters are combat
it depends 
well i think max fall damage needs to be reworked 
like that, 1 hr short/ 8 hr long seems much more reasonable 
i think it’d fit if hit points were supposed to describe the literal meat chunks you can have carved off of you without you dying, but im pretty sure hp is, at least according to most of the nerds who’s videos i’ve watched just a combination of the tenacity, dumb luck, and sheer willpower that allows your character to not get turned into paste the moment a dragon swats you with it’s claws that are the size of your entire body.
nah i don’t like that 1 day short 1 week long
*oh
oj
[1560805016] Eric Huang: also did you say 1 day short/1 week long rest system

&lt;&lt;&lt; i don’t know what this means, did you have a stroke or something 
but at low levels we should probably be short resting pretty often
the only issue with the feat is it’s one heal per person per short rest
thats all it is
surgerys take the place of feats in asi’s and big attachments give me a minus to stealth
could totally hash it out so it’s balanced 
and?
how about this, milo, if i were to say, medically attach a pair of gryffon wings to my body, would you give me a scuffed flight speed if i rolled well enough?
What about it?
What do you see?
you saw it, right
oh
which part?
wait what’s inadvisable?
and i can heal as a bonus action
its a fun character 
oh i could play my shitty rogue healer
im generic fightman who calls parsa a rascal for not giving potions
im joking ofc
im changing my character 
Rip in peace
twink dmpc
twink dmpc
...
me small brain though 
me statline big as fuck
no
i’ll go cleric ir something if i die
we have 2 fighters
a bard right?
a bard?
what role are you jett?
ah
we should go it soon, my injury-induced schedule unfucking won’t last forever

oh also Uti got fuckcing funding for his game
and i don't actually know what anyone thinks about that
A LOT
like
cause i notice that i tend to talk over people and go off and do my own thing in these games
you want me to shut up more often i'll do my best
i'd love to hear it
if you have anything you'd prefer over my dumbass suggestions
i mean
is it that dnd thing that i just put in the chat? yeah. is it big gay? probably.
so i came up with a lil somethin somethin to gather the boys on this glorious day of april first 
i was talking to eric and we're both bored as hell
jk
real fun
i came up with this fun game where i get on the bus and lick the handholding poles and then spit into the nearest grandma's mouth
nm
wassup my guy
milo
quack
yabalchoath
yalbachoath
rip

but like
that's kinda fkd
holy shit lmao
rly?
happy thanksgiving mang
oh wait
is jett in town?
fkn lol
but leaving the paychecks there looks weird to the bosses
yeh
that said i only really go get them when someone asks me about it
thought i was running low and then bam 200 bucks, thank you, past mars for exercising restraint 
cause then i pick them up and it's like a mini, mid-pay period payday
for like 10-14 days
i love letting my tips sit in the office
man
just taking my chances
neither
ye traffic was scuffed
hate being on call
2 hrs to get there and i still showed up 20 mins late
damb dude
i’ll just show up at your window and stare through it w/o saying anything like usual
could be a solid 30 mins tho
im omw
i gotta tell you
it wasn’t that at all
my mom set this shit up
i thought this was gonna be an interview 
fuck man
but after that ye
got a meeting at 11 and idk how long that’s gonna take
i’m coming 
aight vro
oiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
oiii
oi
ya heard eric and jett willb e ready in like 10 mins?
ay
probably true
....
kinda sadboy music but also most certainly not
radiohead is the shit
radiohead is a good gateway drug
fuck
it's gonna be hard to get you from there to swans xd
ic
okok
what you been listening to rn?
hm
for the time being
yuh
6th
on the 6
i guess that gives me enough time to try and get you into swans enough to come to a concert with us
that'd be like next summer
it rly would
and if you were there it'd just be better
i wanna do shrooms or smth with uti very badly
when uti comes
hmm
like
gotta find some time when all the boys are together
lol
yeaah still do it
shrooms do be like an 8 hour trip
idk
hmm
should def try that
yeah
yuh
might cure my crippling depression
and i think it's frankly a fantastic idea
no but my mom wanted to get me into it
i use it to help me write when i really don't know where im going too
but like
just in my room
i haven't done it out in nature
ig yeah
but ye
so maybe that's rubbed off on me
my mom's literally a fuckin shaman i guess
idk
doing shrooms with your friends is cool though
i mean i think that's the best and only impactful way to do them
like total aloneness
generally
in nature
yes
shrooms man
indian spirit quests
like
shrooms were originally and still are a method of spiritual discovery
acid especially like you need other people around in order to have a good time with it
that's what they're meant for
or
that's what they should be for
yeah
uh
you will only get bad trips
cause
and aren't afraid of bad trips
but only if you're using it for that purpose
i guess
that's my plan
once every 3 or so months man
and i know that i rly shouldn't overuse them
but i think of those as more of a spiritual examination sorta thing
because im a fiend for psychadelics
not be high
well
especially alone
my aunt kinda killed my desire to smoke and be high
yeah man
but is also probably for the best
which kinda sucks
i haven't bought weed since my backpack got stolen
oh niice
how's that goin
not the bowl smoking part
i noticed
yeah
parasite made it worth
yuh
but it was a lot of time walking through stores
so not a wasted day
and then saw parasite
too
i spent an hour in the barnes and noble at the grove
i mean
ye
i feel like complete dog
bruh i spent basically all day at the grove looking for a wallet and a jacket
but i do respect it
it makes me mad that you could do it so easily 
no
wait am i in charge of that group?
he can’t?
ok
oh
👌 
if it was me i’d have opened with “listen here you fucking ingrate you’re out”
copy paste or i’ll never believe you
whatd you tell him
how
its pointless
DONT
LOL
to catch up on?
reading?
so i don’t wanna ostracize him from the friend group 
i do like the guy
so he’ll flame until he cannot flame anymore 
it is his fault its just that parsa’s personality is naturally choleric
parsa’s?
yes
or parsa’s idea that you’re going back to
parsa will flame eric immediately doesnt matter if its your idea
yeahhh
oh wait eric blocked him
cause parsa will go straight to him
ask eric
wait
actually 
so you’re not alone
put it in gestalt fixing
sure
i mean im still hiring the chick to manage my bar regardless, lol
now idk if i play as penny or the new chick
well issue solved then
and punch parsa in the face next time you see him
idk i think you just gotta go
xd
every minute he spends arguing is a point of exhaustion 
and the more he does it the more he accumulates exhaustion 
he’s not allowed to insult the pcs unless it’s in character 
parsa is allowed to insult me and my npcs
i’ll leave it at this
he’s just careful
tyler 2 isn’t reformed 
should a reason to do so arise
but i don’t have a problem with kicking him out
i don’t like leaving him out, personally 
idk
parsa is too vanilla
ye
heavily regulated for no automatic firing weapons outside of like the military 
just good old fashioned bullets
no lasers
keep it simple with the guns too
keep it limited to our solar system 
i might do cowboy bednd tho
for sure
but airships and bountyhunters
no
this is essentially just the world i was going to make on crack
with steampunk trains and floating cities and dive bars and shit
apparently its dnd noir
eberron
its dank
i wanna run a campaign in this setting 
im at barnes and noble reading the new dnd book that just came out
i would have a monopoly on information and blackmail overnight 
it’s impossible to resist. come in “complete” anonymity and fuck a girl that can literally be ANYTHING you want?
because eric fears the political power of my changeling whorehouse
it won’t happen
so i can enslave them with drugs and blackmail them into being sex workers at my whorehouse
theres a town full of changelings
i hope that at the top of azure peak
fuck you, parsa
and parsa took that away from me
i just wanna build my establishment and make boatloads of money
so im good
i don’t mind knowing 
have you been talking to eric this whole time?
i know how eric wants to end this version of the campaign 
maybe he should be
hmm
well
that jett is not the master of the house
im going to put forth the tentative idea
im a fan
eric makes no changes?
so same exact campaign?
ic
just wondering 
milo did you ever read eric’s info tabs?
it was aids and is aids
same
cause i think 9 start is perfectly acceptable 
or than start at 7
then have parsa at all?
idk
i’ve always wanted to push start to later
i can’t do saturdays if that’s what you’re asking
no i think it just worked for everyone at the time
on starting a campaign with no parsa?
oh
miles? about what?
and i appreciate that you do as well
i like to operate on a level of 100% confidentiality 
cause sometimes he needs to hear it again
i don’t share your opinions with him unless you bring them up first
if he messages me im just gonna keep telling him to apologize to eric for being a bastard and fix his shit
i mean im sticking to the plan i told you earlier
why?
not since last night
rn no
w8 the pend is real
yeah
he also said he wanted the character to be a passive observer 
nvm you’re absolutely right
yeah shit
you said he used his backstory to flame you
oh
?
what was his backstory 
bad player
i think he was a good character 
so it makes sense
he was specifically playing a debuff bard
i’ve thoroughly tainted the warlock class for him
and decidedly less of an asshole than any others
noxalas was a pretty decent character 
but here’s the thing
it’s correct 
oh yeah cause he was the only one who was charismatic enough without jett
noxalas?
parsa never rly took control 
so yep
that was a direct quote from eric
ngl to you
pretty autismo
thats 
yes
fuck parsa
you’re pretty much the only person who consistently catches eric’s character details that he’s trying to convey
stop ceding your ideas to get along with the rest of the party
if/when it restarts
uh one more thing on the topic of eric’s campaign 
yeh
that shit was hard pending for a sec
oh nvm
oh you mean no uniqlo campaign?
oh well then put me in that bitch
way better
you could make it entirely in person, too
go ahead
yeah
so long as you tell him that to his face
and if you don’t say anything he’ll find out that you didn’t invite him or tell him and then you’ll have pulled a mini-ruben on him
you do have to say it otherwise he won’t get it
otherwise please don’t play.
be fucking peaceable and keep your shit to yourself 
no fucking calling me out on my decisions, stick to one character until they die
say i don’t want you in my game unless you fix your shit
maybe give him a bone
if you do it
you’d have to tell him outright that you don’t want him as a player in this campaign 
but i’d have the parsa beating stick ready at all times
i’d keep him in
i want to run one too
we’re playing eric’s
cause i don’t care how good of a dm he is or what his idea of a good game is
i’ll explain the social experiment 
maybe not that simple
and then after that i’ll tell him to go fuck himself and drop it
and each session i will change my character 
i want to give him 3 sessions
and give him a taste of his own medicine 
specifically so i could just be the most problematic player ever
i said yes to it
i think parsa running is the wrong play
same
at all
and that’s why i think that we don’t actually deserve a campaign 
half of em are like “yeah naw i actually haven’t ever liked your parties. The food sucks.” but they never once actually ate the food.
and now that parsa instigated this shit
that’s what we’ve essentially been doing
but your friends trash your house and don’t talk to you and then leave
and you spend hours prepping every time
but imagine you’re throwing parties for your friend group every fuckin week
and i’ve run a few sessions for the other group
and you know this
campaign is like
but here’s the thing
yuh
idk
idk
for that tho
whoever told him to take a month off is a fuckin disrespectful piece of shit
but he needed to get himself out of that shit
that’ll be cool
he has a link to rejoin the group so when he has an idea he likes he can rejoin and post it
and im trying to help him make ideas so he doesn’t have to throw all his old shit away
eric’s still creating ideas cause he enjoys it and wants to play
eric wants him to stay and for now he’s staying
idk
not at all
because it’s not just gonna change for him
there is a problem with him staying 
there isn’t a problem with him not enjoying the campaign and leaving 
like heres the thing
and of course eric didn’t want him to leave
i’d kick him out
ok yeah no
this distinction is important 
or did he say “im leaving” and eric offered
did he threaten to leave and demand eric change it?
and this world he hates or whatever?
?
laid into eric about the game design 
i haven’t heard this
ok
before
or before that
was that the one jett started?
or gemi?
the archbishop shit?
?
sometimes shit doesn’t work
nobodys fault
miles doesn’t talk, i didn’t know the discussion was happening until it had been decided 
parsa swaps characters too much
we can change that shit
but none of that actually matters since he’s resetting 
jett was the absolute wrong choice for the party leader and story head
nobody reads his info sheets and then they get upset when shit surprises them
at least he isn’t constantly throwing shade
it’s kind of annoying but i get if he’s not feeling it or whatever 
and the fact that he decided to immediately dip out on this mission that we were all doing for him
like im sure miles alt tabs until his turn in combat 
there are other problems with people not engaging and not responding
thats just parsa
idk
very understandable 
and im sure he’s glad you went to him
that’s like betraying his trust in your friendship
that’s completely different from going to his face and calling him a bastard 
oh ruben lying to him and stringing him on?
but w/e
it is working since he reached out to apologize 
i guess
so its gotta be us
but eric doesn’t want to do that cause they’re old friends and eric has gotten much cooler
and it works better when it’s the dm
at least when it comes to dnd he needs someone to hit back
whatever don’t pull your punches and he’ll respond better to that, at least from what i’ve seen
so like
and HE IS
because he’s not nice and he defines himself as a callous and thick skinned individual 
you don’t have to be nice to him
heres the thing with parsa specifically 
k
and he constantly provides opportunities 
situation 
regardless of the situat
i enjoy telling parsa to stick his thumb up his ass
eh
for some stupid reason
the problem is that parsa doesn’t get that
cause it’s not his game
but dm overrules him
yeah
as far as rules lawyering goes at least he’s right
nice
i mean the rules are fine
but because he plays darkest dungeon during sessions and then has the audacity to try and make eric change his game to suit his views
parsa pisses me off not for his in game actions and his opinion voicing
about his choices
and apparently we have some real shit tier players if they’re actually bitching at him
is the thing
its impossible to please everyone 
to say “fuck you guys” and tell the story he wants to tell
rly
i just want him to stand up for himself more
but after i left that long shpiel in the group chat i talked to him 1 on 1 for a while
idk what you and eric talked about 
uh
ok
ye
its the only thing i use to talk to him rly
often
today
bruh do it
but ye
its utis bday
got distracted cause
yes
a i g h t
cause i've got a long walk and that'll kill time
but when i do i'll tell you what i guess eric and i talked about
im boutta leave the house
Aight
gnight
i’ll tell you the campaign details in the morning
same here
yuh yuh
its the smart play
they want it so they can fire all their employees 
so that’s probably where most of their programmers are
well amazon is developing ai software constantly 
because the only reason you’re working there is to be a part of their 0 tax cash cow
or r&amp;d
maybe in the it section too
upper management mostly 
but the inner workings of the company are morally bankrupt
the service is useful so i know idgaf about using it
for anyone making it
idk if i respect the choice to work for amazon
honestly 
system is fuckin broken
l o l
pfft
yea
i only added hillary to that list because hillary gets in trouble for being the most unfuckable woman
if they’re both off, you hit trump and hillary status
if either of these is off a little, partial success
if your appearance is good and you’re not getting in trouble for having sex, you win
everything is appearances and sex
lol
government is still in debt they gotta at least look like they’re bleeding us dry lok
hard agree in that
negating the benefits of doing it in the first place
only problem is that its a pain in the ass to do yourself so most people pay other people to do it for them
it’s actually a busted system but it pays individuals before it pays businesses and the govt so it’s kinda worth
also im sure she’s smart and is spending a good amount of time filing claims on her business expenditures so she can get returns on them
which is kinda the best
but if you make a business out of your freelance stuff you get the benefits of being a business without the detriment of having employees 
same goes for any self owned business though
cause you have to compile your income yourself
it’s very hard when you’re freelance
w2s
i mean all you need is your name your ssn and the files your company sends you
no
eqifax i think?
there are online tools that make it really really easy
yeah
but you’ll get a percentage 
well you won’t get it ALL back
and they’ve gotta pay that when they file
cause you’ll get it back when you file taxes
no
it’s literally a detriment to keep them all
company has to pay ssn taxes healthcare taxes, wage taxes for every person on payroll
t
they’re literally flushing money down the drain by having that many extra people
managers gotta fire someone in that case
until the next one off change
it just stays that way
and if they make a one off change for any reason
cause my job literally copy pastes the same schedule every week
every week it’s different?
its just like
how are shifts usually assigned?
damb
?
do they pay you extra
rly you just bust it over there?
i mean tomorrow
you’re doing it?
when do you work?
haha
i agree
hmm yes
agreement is the lifeblood of society 
agreement
lol
mhm
but in a way that’s funny enough to be valuable 
ehh they’re kinda retarded
frat guys wear college jerseys more often
the johnny guy
whos also def in a frat
black people
at all
like there’s no reason that supreme should be selling better than uniqlo
like you’re doing this instead of trying to make quality products 
but if its a brand that’s only used for the clothing itself then it feels like kinda cheap?
then the branding has a use
cause then it’s actually broadcasting your enjoyment of a specific thing that you can then use to find people with similar interests 
or skateboard shops or something 
like brands for places or sports teams or bands
i can see the appeal for clothing brands specifically when the thing they’re branding for is focused on something else
lol
idk maybe
like making clothing to specifically look good and artful is different than generating social circles around clothing brands and using those to inflate your sales
fashion is a seperate thing from branding i think
idk
but things like supreme or bathing ape or gucci skate or diamond or whatever
cause they make shoes designed for the purpose of skating 
i think certain brands get a pass, like vans or huff or hearlys
i disagree 
the font isn’t even good
most skate brands are stupid but a hundred dollars for a fucking red tag with plain white lettering
and FUCK supreme
you buy them because someone tells you they look good on you and because they have the brand
you don’t buy them because they’re good
like dior sunglasses, right
people wear brands mostly to show off imo
but im not gonna be a walking advertisement 
maybe im a boomer or some shit
but that’s mostly cause i HATE having brands on me
i still mostly wear graphiclrss single colored stuff
and my style will be mine
but i’m a bastard
my moms def got better style
cause i mostly go by gut reaction on clothes and stuff
cause i instant reject like 90% of the stuff she picks out
eventually my mom stopped shopping for me
ok nah that would legit take time
l m a o
?
and of course she needs you there for a second opinion 
idk man
target, ross, and online only place to buy clothes
used to go all the time with my mom and it made me go nuts how much time she spent on each decision 
can’t stand it
idk in general i hate shopping
or printed ones
are they plain colored packaged shirts?
25 if theyre specific prints that i have to go out of my way to buy
i max at like 20 for clothes cause im cheap
but they’re uniqlo
thats like normal jeans
christ
is it 50 post discount?
u got some long legs
true true
its like new york with better signage and smaller side streets
50 buck jeans?
so i think they don’t expect to get wet
i mean japanese people actually use umbrellas
i think that is quite literally the appeal of uniqlo
is techwear waterproof?
thats one way to do it
selling techwear to stupid americans 
nicee
is that the big boss or smth?
mr yunai?
worth if you work there then
how much is your employee discount?
uniqlo is expensive 
thats right
did he get the discount?
oh hit me
wassup my guy?
ahh
about what? 
you said you wanted to
boi im tired af
that's enough for the month
2 with them and 3 with jonah and im over it
i just played like 5 games
nah i good
eh
gimme a sec i need to go grab some water tho
even rn
ya boy free
the problem is that he doesn’t actually pay attention to what other people say
its still pretty jarring but after a few sessions i’ll get over it
tactically oriented no nonsesne military man style
if you notice, he’s arguing in character 
part of this is the character he’s playing 
we let him get away with too much for too long
that makes sense
probably yea
hmm
i like to assume that things are handled in whichever way will be the most interesting and fun
he'd still be like "wow this is just a consolation prize" because he's both too smart, and too aspie to just appreciate the bullshit for what it is
it's not like eric can just give you a ring of protection and walk away, even though that would make parsa exceedingly happy
parsa never really gets to benefit from this cause he changes characters constantly, so he never gets any dm favoritism because eric doesn't know what to give his characters
it's painfully obvious that this happens.
is that parsa's mad cause eric tends to play favorites with the player characters in his games
what it comes down to
i can't even think goo
my mental is fucked after all that shit man
wow that was completely incoherent
it's funny, because when it comes down to it, i think parsa and i have pretty similar ideas of  what the ideal game would look like, but i don't care as much about actually having it as he does.
it's just that parsa doesn't like that we're going to get away with it, because it fucks with his idea of the ideal game
and he knows that we're gonna get away with any stupid shit we decide to do
so i know that we're gonna get away with any stupid shit we decide to do
yeah
but
about
as anyone who's played with parsa should be paranoid
i know that eric is super paranoid about killing PCs
i know this
and eric doesn't want to kill pcs
and eric doesn't want to kill pcs
the problem is that when he plays those characters he goes all in and you kinda need to meet someone there for it to work
doesn't like that when we make stupid decisions in his eyes that we don't get the same amount of shit
and parsa after just having played a stupid character and being berated for it
but eric will only use one or two at a time
the two games are very different because kevin uses a lot more plot hooks
but back to the main point
i probably would have done the same for a different reason
parsa would have killed us if he was dm
like notice the glorfindel scene where we walked away
eric tends to go for some blend of the two
parsa wants to assume that things are handled realistically
but not always enough for us to not be forced to make assumptions when we make plans
eric always has enough prep done
*said
that says
since i think he's done a lot more prep on the world in general than eric has
there's less left open ended
is a lot more controlled
kevins
the two campaigns are very different
granted the one plan he brought up we shot down pretty harshly
is the thing
he just doesn’t want to try shit
but the problem is the inflexibility 
everyone has an ego
it doesn’t happen like this in the other game
kinda ridiculous 
parsa’s constant ranting is
don’t feel bad if you haven’t, i told uti about it 2 years ago and he still tells me he’ll read it tomorrow
did you ever check out the story i recommend you?
but having shifts is good for the mental
7 am is a lot
yeah
yeah
and just sit in front of a computer all day like eric
i’ve been trying to teach myself the adobe suite so maybe i can get into all that design shit
yeah man
but schedules get fucky cause he has a lot of clients with a lot of problems 
the boss there has genuine interest 
making movie adverts and shiet
PA at a company called picturemill 
well if i make it hopefully i can quit from my dads 
*ready
over and over 4 times alreay
i’ve been like rescheduling this one interview like
BAAAGH
hows the week treating you?
what’s good my boy
is good
ye
i do that even when im not high
i do that even when im not high
im just making the pitch for it that i normally make
don't read it rn
yeah he's written a lot
but there's a sequel that is currently going on that is somehow better than the first
ended in 2013
it started in like 2011
and that's just in quality of writing
and then it will build back up to that high quality
then the quality will dip a little bit and there will be some typos and shit
so the beginning will be pretty high quality with very few errors
because the author has been going back and redoing the early chapters to make them presentable for a book format
it's kinda fucking weird
i will note
np
here's the first page
and if you don't want to know any of this shit
here's the summary if you want that
but by the end you're like holy fuckin shit
it's a bit of a slow burn in the beginning
it would
if you don't mind reading shit on a screen
it's a web series that will one day get turned into a book but is currently freely available to read
"oh cause it does"
or why does kryptonite kill superman? 
"oh cause he's rich and good"
no arbitrary shit like why does batman have a million guns and not kill people?
and then there are reasons for the bullshit that happens that make sense in it's own self contained world
like there are still characters running around with powers, but it treats it realistically, and the characters themselves act more like people.
in the story
but it breaks down the genre
it's a story within the genre
i mean it's both
it's pretty good, but doesn't start out that way
but much deeper
sorta like that
The Boys
sorta like uh
which takes the genre of superheroic shit and breaks it down
called Worm
i was gonna suggest a series for you to read in your spare time
they've confirmed a second spiderverse
cool
correct?
and think "yeah this is pretty cool"
like you'll watch marvel movies
to a certain degree you like super hero shit
milo
OH
that is a quote from the best shit ever
everyone will be working together
finally
and then the last one just want's to play the two sides off each other for personal gain
and the other half is normal religious nuts
work together when half the party is comprised of evil religious nuts
it's hard to kind of
oh yaeh
what u mean in the group call?
x d
fuck off
she's an elf?
tf does the archbishop have?
plus you're the direct descendant of gemi chance
honestly they kinda deserve it
hell yeah
be a snake bitch
im gonna add that move to my repertoire of stupid ass shit to do in calls
LOL
lol
cat food
hell yea
thaaaats a pretty decent reason to consider it
id suggest a panini if it was your mom
burrito 
pretty much 
wow
look at that
speak of the mf devil
jk that’s how my dad operates 
just let him talk at you for a while or something
oh, yeh that’d be dope
i mean what would you say?
luckily you’ve still got a relatively quiet hour beforeit gets super busy
that sounds good
yeh
maybe with a destination in mind, maybe not
idk if i were you i’d start with going for a
walk
but it’s muuuch easier to get caught in thought loops at home
you could do it at home
or toke up again, head to the beach, and do some more soul searching 
like a professional one
maybe work on putting together a resume
or start looking at jobs
find some peeps to hang with
read books look for movies
i feel you
yeah man
tho
we will go to the beach sometime soon
i want to get all this running around shit done early cause it’s gonna take like several hours
yeah sor vro
shit was cash
yuh
aight
oh shit
?
suit
cause if im coming im putting on my gear
halloween?
are you gonna get dressed up for whatever eric’s doing?
cool
ahh
huh ok
im free thurs
damb i’ll see
damb i’ll see
feel dog, feel
ty
but I don’t even have a bed in my room
maybe another day
nada
thank you vro
yes
takin up nearly the entire goddam street
i would have if not for this giant ass mexican parade like right down hollywood blvd
very cool of you brother
ay ty again for letting me stay over
bye
night
F
makes sense
oof
or did the guys just transfer
did they get kicked out?
regardless not good idea if you want to do school or have pressure to do school
but that's a p good idea
i mean fuck i didn't do that
that shit flies by
ngl
doodling
i literally spent a few entire days at smc hanging in the library
xd
that's what i did
then you'll just stop going
because 
don't start skipping classes
i got all my novels planned out already i just gotta stop being too depressed to actually make it
feel
that's my plan
and then just come back when you're a millionaire
go no contact
i mean you can always
just to smooth the transition
like something artistical and relatively big
what if you did something else instead?
if you don't?
that mans has your back
just put your trust in speedwagon
yeh
no that was just a specific fuck you to the tradition
tbh
i lost no nut november on november first 12:01 am
i didn't do nnn
except
nnn was rough
so im not simply talking out my ass
i read one of the books cause of losing no nut november
mhm
but it's kinda getting there
as close as it gets
that's like
"battle brother we have survived the onslaught of xenos and heretical hermaphrodite space demons, come embrace me so we can celebrate our victory"
and bro-ing out
a bunch of giant dudes in metal suits killing shit
it's sorta going there
idk
so he likes warhammer warhammer
nah he read the books
you guys are just a bunch of idiots on a ship and everything and everyone that breathes and/or has a pulse wants to kill you
take warhammer lore and throw it out the window
it's literally just
anyone who's played it would understand
nah dark heresy is a fucking based game
when the gay anime streamers start getting to streaming dark heresy
i am scared to see how he handles that one
just wait
his blessed warhammer is next
homestuck, undertale, dungeons and dragons
everything that is remotely cool and on the nerd radar gets gay'd
at least in the popular scene
straight overrun
the nerd fanbase has been
like
rly
yeah
he's too vanilla
except maybe parsa
anyone else
that it'd be just
i honestly thought
we were right
but i didn't think it'd be her.
i mean there's always one
i didn't think she'd be the one
gwyn rly just
or form
shape
in any way
then it's just a thing that we should treat with respect and not discuss
unless it's not a thought
yeh
yeah no
omg
i want to die
kms
xD
Taylor
Mars into
hmm
wait
it'll turn mars into Rams
don't need em
screw women
Just watch Jojo.
Sold!
What's your budget?
both options are alright by me in all honesty
well
erlll
erll
bottom
NO
i guess
top
idk
uhhhhh
uh
omg
(dog)
yep
is taking survival into account, i’d rather have consensual sex with a chick with a shark for a vagina than i would with hillary clinton
what it comes down to
i think
maybe if she was billary or something 
hillary coulda won if she wasn’t hillary 
ok
to win
ascended to a completely different form of human being
she would have to have like
she couldn’t have
yes
Bernie won and hillary got fucked
in every single projection
he did
Thats a fuckin 48 hr roast 
DAMN
rigged by hillary worshipping fuckeheads
same thing
true true
bernie ceded to her cause female too
the demos liked her cause female
no
throw so much shit that you can’t see through it
orangutan debate tactics strong
and anyone with eyes coulda known
ez pickings
yeah cause she’s like a goddamn firing range to trump
XD
vagina&gt;peen
well i meant in the eyes of the populus
ikr
so that means she’s good
she has vagina
one
and fuck over the democratic vote
her narcissistic ass had to run
fuck hillary tbh
shoulda voted bernie
then
probably trump than
ah
could be age thing too
feels rough
wot
and in classes
and you do get your govt appointed neetbux just for being signed up
ye true
unless its free college 
like going to college to figure out what you wanna do is a fantastic misuse of your money 
thats why unless you have a specific goal that you need school for i say don’t go
school gay
and that lol
you’ll have v little time with school and work
but also scuffed
n i c e
o btw have you still been taking classes at smc?
ye
24
probably 
she’d mind me and her friends 
but
i wouldn’t mind her friends
in a single
yeeeeep
unless we get a single in which case i don’t wanna split a one bedroom with a guy and my sister
ye no pressure 
autissimo always a plus
oh yeah i was counting on that as one of the good parts
are you saying you’re messy?
?
ye
what i don’t know cant hurt me
no fucking my sister and getting caught 
or at least
no fucking my sister
like
also thered have to be ground rules
ye thatd be scuffed
yeah
but if not then it could be scuffed
if you want to split 3 ways thats still an option that she’s cool with
so like in october i may get a place w/ her
my sister is prob moving back to la soon
or an update 
Oi milo just a heads up
and there was no side with them alternative route?
edelgard was still the flame emperor and everything?
feels bad
oh
hows jett's golden deer playthrough?
hows it goin
oi
that's the only high level play i use and it generally gets the job done
or better yet just use stride and have everyone burst shit down?
or just have petra burst shit down
what reroll for crits?
the gimmicks?
i didn't expect all the fuckin boss units to have so much speed
first actual defeat came at master tactician
ok
did you see his c support?
yup
it should be more upfront about how dark it is
that's fuckin nasty and awesome
i like the fact that they're like fuckin tumors that either grow naturally or are implanted into a kid's body
cause it seems like most people in the game seem to know a fair bit about them
the only problem i have is that they shouldn't have introduced the crests as if they were some mysterious thing that people don't know about
like very bad
a lotta these characters have had some fucked up lives
also learning some of the backstories
im a fan of three houses
but
yeh
I respect you
that's all i have to say on the matter
then seteth is the big bitch
if flayn is a little bitch
too bad flayns a little bitch who doesn't want to burn down the church
that's pretty good
oh
in that area?
does it heal everyone?
flayn=shit
flayn doesn't have warp
so i guess it's cool
spear of assal isn't as broken as the caduceus staff 
i mean
why is that in the game lmao
wtf
its literally an unlimited vulnary?
spear of assal gay, what does it do?
*tho
doesn't even have lance of ruin th
stronger than sylvain?
rly?
he's like level 10
my ferdinand dies when he's struck by a gentle breeze
nobody can kill frederick in awakening
i meant frederick
IM rarted
3 houses?
oh you mean
?
he's literally unkillable
the problem is that nothing can kill ferdinand
maybe that's the play
and see what happens
and then just dumpster the rest of the game
aside from galeforce morgan
where i just kill every nonessential character
hmm im thinking i wanna do a run
awesome
lmao
lucina and frobin?
it was fuckin awesome
my morgan was soloing the entire story
is ridic
and the fact that female robin/morgan/kid of whoever robin bones gets access to it
is op
the dark flier class
i think it was just that
xddd
i kinda miss my noire morgan duo
idk man
way more content then fates or awakening
agreed
it rly is
I am doing it now
now i wanna play awakening
aptitude broke
yeaaa
and then morgan is just a monster
the only good build for female robin was to pair her with an already ridiculous donnel
i only used mrobin once i found out that female robin sucks for statting children
oh shit
wot
right your morgan was a dude eh?
and sometimes he got the chance to get a hit in on an enemy if she didn't instantly delete it with nosferatu crits
i had him following around my fuckin broken ass morgan with a shitty axe
gerome
GEROME
NO
g e r a l t
wears the mask
he's a child, flies on a dragon only good with axes
im thinking of the unit
and fuck fates
fuck gunter
oh
the batman guy
is gunter his name?
gunter?
on uh
actually in my second run i used them
like at all
also i don't think i used axes in awakening
then they were ass
if they were in awakening
not in awakening
no
holy shit
is that a thing?
levin axes?
axes?
bolt
good
oh
so i was worried
i thought it used arcane crystals
i might use it more if it's umbral steel
that works
it's the most inefficient use of time
i hate resting man
charging mechanic on it
i just don't like the uh
well yeah that'll do it
you can't prove me wrong
enhanced levin sword is just a better sword of the creator
sword master is op
rly?
and then like thief
you can go hard into myrmidon
so i could just gimp everything with the levin sword
i wish i just maxed out speed and magic
cause i was tryna grab people the way it tells you to
i have middling stats across the board
nah i hate my build for bytheth
imma overwrite that save right fuckin now
actually im not gonna do that
i may do that
makes sense
and just picked up from there
oh you saved
it started there?
*not
why nt
?
but kinda awesome
complete bullshit
if you do it right
it takes like a month and a half tops
and have them follow you around in combat
and maybe have them do the mission assistance thing
for them
and make sure to do all the lost items
you literally just dump your gift inventory
ya
i got ingrid and marianne that way
to get it
can save scum
but you
it's like a 60% chance of happening every week
lemme in
yo
and be like
and then they'll come to you some time during the week
raise support to B
you just gotta
that you don't need to do all that stat leveling to get people to join your class
i was gonna say tho
dark spikes is rly fucked
you can fuckin oneshot the death knight with her
oh, also lycithea is fuckin cheese
make raphael do 8 hits per turn
did you know
now all he has to do is snag dorothy
you still fuck shit up
don't matter if you're doing 8 per hit or 20
4 attacks do be a bitch
and he wails on em
you just put some gauntlets on him
right
is claude a beast?
how's jett liking the golden deers?
ye let me know
i like speculating though
me neither
cause then you just get a freelo edelgard and hubert
the other 2 routes would be easier
it does mean that
may b
i c
o
where you join edelgard?
oh you mean
that seems like a lot more work than necessary
no i don't think they're gonna make the flame emperor not edelgard
well
*half lmao
hal
unless the other houses have multiples
that means 4 routes total
*betraying the church
but now im betraying the empire with her and everything is gucci
it's fine i just didn't realize that i'd have to fight edelgard in ch 11
looking at him makes me sick
fuuuuuck lorenz
i think i fucked up
also
fuck that dude
and i immediately declined him
"yeah i def wanna join your class"
then he was all like
i accidentally pressed recruit on lorenz
y u h
you get to rule of cool shit and you get to tell people to fuck off
executive dm power is the best part of being dm
and thats the end of the conversation 
just say “suck a dick, parsa”
and if parsa has anything to say
if its your game you can literally always make the call to do something different than how the books say
just wanted to add about rules lawyer parsa
ok finally got a minute at work
xd
mhm
or you can’t do it without magical bullshit
then you can’t do stealth missions
vs all the other gimpy shit
cause if the alliance is like humans elves tieflings
do they all look alike?
thats why i wanna do an only human dnd campaign 
yeh
and that made me want to not make them
i just didn’t know how to balance combats
a good idea
its not
and use whatever they wanted
letting everyone make up their own shit
my problem was like
i’ve got a system that could make it work
but
the setting was too hard
lmao and ya wonder why that thing i did never got a second session?
if you do plan a defined story we’d really just find a way to fuck it up
thats deeefinitely true
yeah
i like to make shit happen
miles just lets things happen
mhmm
maybe not with these players
can work
up until like level 5 you’re basically nobodies
if you’re meeting a king or smth
it just kinda does
i don’t think it explicitly needs an overarching story till like 6 or so sessions in
thats a big one
whats that?
huh?
but yeah i get what he was saying 
dungeons and dragons as a whole is super nerdy
i do think its a good idea
but like 
it’s not in person afaik
are you gonna join pars’s campaign?
milo
busy
i was
cause
didn't see those
sor
the ball
uh
part 1
same with lycithia and hubert
not sure if sylvain and bern can get supports cause they aint leveling 
at the three way battle
i got all of them save felix
everyone else is kinda shitty though
thats pretty sick
actually, i could put dorothy with felix
hubert gets lycithea
bernadetta gets sylvain cause i think thats hilarious 
so rip
but her heart belongs to edelgard
aside from the professor
im pairing her with him cause there rly isn’t anyone better
lmao
ferdinand needs the stables so he has to share it with dorothea
everyone else levels fine
*doing
thats all im foing
i was going pally yea
Oh okay, then
what class did you make him?
rn he feels like off brand sylvain
he’s good if you level him?
now ferdie is just a waste of space
cause i fed all the enemies to literally everyone else
also my ferdinand sucks
whoops
ferdinand is rarted
Are you watching it?
not at all
no you’re not
thats a fat oof
FERDINAND
LOL
invite flayn to tea parties every
i fuckin
lmao imagine if my sister was a dumb anime bitch
so im like
and my sis died her hair green
cause they’re both short
she reminds me of my sister
don’t tell me if she dies
shes cute
but
flayn is completely useless
best girl is flayn
but
fuck sylvain i still say edelgard is better
he’s literally fiending for that pussy from day 0
hilarious 
its fucking
is play a female
to recruit him
all you need to do
and suddenly that base is filled better than he could possibly ever do it
recruit sylvain 
but
to tank hits bernie and petra
hes literally there
has no crest
i force fed him and petra
no crest
after aaaaaallll that
and then
and just hope he gets enough axe exp to be half decent 
so you gotta put him on weeding and level it constantly 
and no focus for it
got the worst armor stat
and he’s
and even then he’s a cuck
he’s only useful as a heavy armor knight
i don’t think it’s worth 
don’t 
dude he screams like a fuckin mong
oooof
special attacks?
he uses his uh
hear his screams when
you ever
LOL
about as far from chad as it gets
is
casbar
archers are broken
how would he win
caspar is still alive for me
casbar
o h
is named chauster
the fuck
who
chauster?
yea you just can’t fight with him
so i think you’ll just get it anyway 
he’s still in the cutscenes after he dies tho
story info?
don’t care about anything else
im saving him for the roasts
hubert doesn’t offer that shit
cause of that dps
petra worth it
just to get him back
just to get him back
i loaded an old save
i wanted to pair him with lysithea
shit
and i don't know when
i let hubert die
i think
oh fuck
archers are also really strong for some reason and i don’t get it
and the fights vs giant monsters are really fun i was surprised 
the game is good
and she’s on my team
i just beat the flayn mission
but
and b the beginning was not fun
the other night i feel like i was roasting 3 houses cause a i didn’t know shit about the story 
ok
hey milo you hungry?
means you can build the characters more
but long is good i guess right
oh wow
lmao
thats a lot
oh shit
except all of them 
itd just be like juno or smth
bruh the builds are like the best part
cause like
im rly not sure on the children part
i c
lmao
but im choosing between this and borderlands 3
it likely won’t suck
arright ty
and return it if it sucks
actually maybe i’ll buy a physical copy 
id be all over it
maaan if it wasn’t 60 bucks
oof
or on par with it?
better than awakening?
ok
how do you rate 3 houses?
oh
:0
the only option 
black eagles, brother
fuck the other houses
nah
which house?
vr important question 
milo
ay
if you dont imma rko you next time i see you on jah
AY MILO YOU GONNA PLAY RISK OF RAIN WITH US OR WHAT?
so i gotta double wrap sometimes
and they're small
idk how many
i have like
no
i do
ya
i have like 6 lighters at all times
i work in a restaurant
one what?
yes
thats a solid bit higher than min wage, nice
what does uniqlo pay in general?
yeah
in general, the tips are great
it’s minimum wage plus tips
it really depends on your hours
itd be dope
yuh
disclaimer, im drunk so im not sure if this makes sense
if you ever decide you want to work in the business of getting people inebriated, lets try and get the apt thing rolling. at least better than camping did.
so uh
whenever we get that apt thing with michael and miles, i absolutely am gonna try and get you a job at my bar
and i have to be at work by 9:30 tomorrow 
can’t im pretty busy tonight 
landing that fucking spike is so hype
i just spiked a dark samus off the ledge with up special twice in one game
i love smash 4 dedede
bruh 
im on the 3rd st promenade 
im not at your house
i’ll be 30 mins
stay there
thats far as shit
wait fuck that
ok
east then
montana?
ok on
?
where tf that?
wat
alright then
yes
i will be in possession of some acid p soon
i mean
that shit’d be hype
we definitely should do a hangout with miles
but yes
i don't need much
sure
save me a tiny bit
so he let me have a bit
and my dad knows i am fond of the sativa
and he gave my dad a shitton of jars just full of weed
my dad's friend grows it and stores that shit
yeah like this
idk
idk
the thc factor?
but like
it's not the uh dryness
or like wine
weed ages like cheese
lemme tell you something
smoke a bit of the 3 year aged weed that my dad gave me
and just
we could also not do shrooms
it'd involve betraying her trust a little
though maybe
they're for her spiritual journey work
yeah
i know those are good
but i don't think she will
tbh i could maybe ask my mom to sell me some of her shroom chocolates
that they're quality shrooms
shit is good
it's hard to make sure that the uh
fair nough yeah
wait what are you planning on doing?
and now i once more want drugs to assist my personal and spiritual growth
i guess
unrepressed?
and it has since become
my memory was very bad at the time
mostly cause
so im makin plans to do that again sometime soon
nothing's made me trip like ayahuasca
so idk
but i took half at a time
very very weak
the shrooms were
*oh
ph
those few
eyah
just a few
yeah
not the best
and  then you're seeing infinite crystal hallways instead of the room around you and shaking and scaring people
and realize that you went past your limit two hours ago
until you get to a place where there is no water
which kind of works
so now i just slap that water like it's my mother
my dad instilled a healthy fear of looking like a fool into me
once i get like 3 beers or 2 shots in i start going fuckin wild policing myself
not fun
i see
but it does make you rarted
but you can hold your liquor
just 2 beers?
comin up
yeah
but it hasn't been his birthday yet
i was thinking he was 19
f
wt
jett's 18
oh right
that's pretty cool
he's a straight s l e u t h
it's his, he can do whatever
but if he bought it
yeah
don't get high of someone else's supply should be the phrase
you can get high off your own supply if as long as you're not distributing it for someone else
i mean
l m a o
solid meme
or basically anything that can be classified as barely porn
watching minecraft videos on pornhub
like
watching that shit on pornhub is a fucking top tier meme
but
okay
i haven't seen that shit
LOL
OH RIGHT
and that's brotherhood
that shit's gay
there was memes and fucking around, but it wasn't YES evil guy is going to DESTrOY THE WORLD NOW WE HAVE TO SAVE IT WITH FRIENDSHIP
nah first fma had a very solid, smaller scale storyline that had much less melodrama
yeah
also if anyone tells you their favorite anime is full metal alchemist brotherhood they're a fucking faggot
but it's good as shit so who cares
and this show be gay
and shows that are gay
like there are shows that aren't gay
*is
cause it it
cause otherwise you'll be all self conscious, that this shit's super gay
with headphones
do it alone
like when you watch it
it's very gay
fucking 
it's
it's really that good
lmao
mujin foo
for completely different reasons
but i like samurai champloo about equally as much as i like little witch academia
and samurai champloo
OH
aside from maybe evangelion
rep
like
idk if there are any animes out there that i can
lol
that's a weeby show
miles watches fucking hunter hunter
it's true
makes me wonder why
and the shit i say
i have yet to be called a weeb
to be honest
i c
i find it's much easier to say, I'm not a weeb, but i can appreciate some animes from time to time
is it easier?
you should attempt to turn him into a weeb
i think
uti's a mad lad
same
the fucker didn't say shit
actually im p sure his spring break was last week
i don't think he's coming back for spring
and i can make next saturday be good fairly easily
but thursday and friday are good days
my mom is coming into town, which makes planning things hard
well thursday and on
post thursday
i think i'll be free like
and i could have made that
yeah they were gonna go for kbbq
ic
to hang
0 minutes
and that leaves me with
i gotta be home by like 8:30
but
i would
wo
fucking dropkicks the old man
i recommend you watch it all the way through
this is just a clip
made me believe that there's still good in the world
this show
holy guacamole
i pretty much only use headphones. for the surround sound
fair enough 
no headphones?
lmao thats fucking rough
whoops
Fair enough.
just certain special attacks
but i doubt it’s every attack
i don’t mind the SHAA tbh
and it looks fucking awesome
where you play as hornet
a new hollow knight coming
there's
oh
so its cool
2b is a robot
i guess thats true
ah
but
like beyonetta’s one thing
2b is too thicc for smash though
yeah itd be cool
nier automata is a good ass game
but regardless 
its spicy
yeah
fucking hilarious 
and just die
is the one where you remove your os chip
still my favorite ending
but that ones not a joke
yeah im pretty sure theres a different ending
but half of them are joke endings
yeah
theres just more game
but that fight is the end of the story 
i don’t wanna spoil it
hmm
wait its not like
yeah
that i haven’t done yet
theres more after that
where you choose 9s
very different in route d
yeah its
ah thats that i thought ok
and chose a2
oh
so you climbed the tower?
pillar getting created, right?
route c ends with the uh
oh im retarded
oh!
its worth
with the black box shit
i think she succeeded in killing 9s in the beginning of the game though 
both
i think so
it became very hype
cinematic and shit
once the puzzles started getting like
yeah
that sounds cancer
*hacking
it is
9s’s havking thing
‘s
i started liking 9s
oneshot an add and get all my health back
yeah i like
yeah it was
and that usually did it
and i just ran straight at things like a monkey and slapped all my buttons
my build was like 25% dodge enhancement, 25% damage, 50% healing from damage
sounds shitty
lmao
oh
thats bs
wait real
and its not boring cause it still looks fucking cool
and only doing counter attacks
by just slapping the shit out of the dodge button
that you can break the game
i realized 
thats how it goes
lmfao
oof
oof
yeah that shit
yeah he’s a good support 
and just started killing shit
i liked how he lost all motivation 
yeah he kinda does
well
i also liked 9s much more after 2b dies
a2 is dope
yeah
lmao yeah
also fast as fuck
dude route c is hype
so far so good
hopefully
ye

the inked damage is too high
idk why
inkling is rly strong
yes
they’re so retarded

yes
l m a o

*day 1
most d1 noobs cannot deal with this, since they are just mashing their attack buttons. And then they die
every time you attack there will be a glowing gold light that reaches around your stamina bar and if you time your button press so that you input your next attack when the light reaches a certain point on tha bar your attacks become linked and they come out faster
if you wanna be able to consistently beat the people you’ll be matched with all you rly need to know is how to goldlink
most people don’t and then get mad that they get stomped
tutorial will teach you all that as long as you pay attention 
yea exactly 
dogshit unless you can feint like a king
well
and your starting deck will be dogshit
cause its much easier to unlock moves
but it helps
no
up to 10 if youre trash
ye the pve takes like 3-4 hours if you’re a god at hide and seek
ofuk
and a message just went out that they fixed the item bug
but modtly its just so i can update my school so when you start you can join and have access to some useful moves
theres a glitch on pc that causes some people’s items to not be rewarded/disappear that they’re trying to fix by tomorrow
yo if you do end up buying it lmk
and it reminds me of like an early mortal kombat theme
adam is so gay
but that music is so fucking good especially since
i didnt think itd be the adam fight
of all the things i miss from pre-route C neir automata
that's rough
that's it isn't it they beat it once and were like o ok
idk how this game wasn't goty
that way u only play the good parts
bumrush the story
i did too
i like the hacking
it gets better later
9s controls like a pos too
fuckin
i get why you wouldn’t want to though
damn
those first playthroughs are like the fuckin prologue
the first mission of the third playthrough is so drastically different and so fucking crazy that like
and dude
i hust beat nier automata for the second time
milo my guy
and flynt's fake beard
yung humma's fuckin
fried or fertilized isn't bad enough to be good

this is my fighty boi
thats a surprisingly good picture
its so sick
yea man
the sexiest piece of gear in absolver
i finally fuckin got it
Woohoo!
Woo!
but if its all good then cool
so i was hoping to give you a warning
i figured he was about to flame the fuck out of you over some dumb shit
generally it ofc means he’s gonna give you shit over picking a weeby boi
specially
i dont know what that means
and he told me he was gonna go harass you about your character
so i said that ur samurai character looks remarkably not cancerous
i assumed when you said that you’d told parsa your character wasn’t gonna know us, that you had also told him that you swapped to a new boy
i made big mistake
sounds good
ohhh ok
and lands and shit?
lysandre owns a castle?
r u old war buddies?
oh?
i think this party’ll work out
anyway
or something along those lines
i’d call you a pussy
fair
and offer to replace your eyes with better ones
but then im gonna call you four eyes
you could
so like its understandable
the picture is awful though
so i think im on the right track
he’s already called my character disgusting
did he call you a weeb?
oh ok
i think there’s a katana monk weapon
two handed tho?
oh yea u could just use dex weapons
do you need armor for ac as a samurai fighter?
i think so
yeah
can’t keep them up
im not good with ones that are close to my own, lmao
i didnt do a good job of doing that with hansa
ye
i like that character a lot
but yes
i learned all the fuckin words to that song too
goddamn
like
but the whole record themed into animation is so fucking good
if the ending credits were shorter i woulda watched all of them
and cause nujabes is relatively unknown
cause nobody talks about it
underrated
yes it is
the title sequence
you know whats fuckin underrated about that show?
oh
but if you wanna go jin ill back you up
which is always good
being atypical would serve to make you appear less weeby though
ok
who is dumb
or a dumb bitch
wait now i dont know if you need to play like a cocky dickhead who only cares about money and bitches or a holier than thou dickhead who looks smart but is a medium key bool
b r u h
oh wait
is the name an acronym on top of everything?
mufuu jin
i wanna try that at some point
ye
you can be very scary without being edgy
s a m e
parsa was a tn edgy boy
very fair
are you an edgy boy?
ok
oh
have met
but parsa abd i talked the other day about how our characters are gonna like
i like the second one
shit
holy
yea
i’d rather turn pages
but idk i dont like scrolling through it
i do too, dont get me wrong lol
i gotta read physical copies
i hate reading from pdfs that are more than 20 pages long
chapter 20
but it only gets good adter like
its good
the way of kings
that uh stormlight shit
cause eric got me into his gay book series
books
to get
except im gonna stop at the bookstore
im heading home
nop
r i p p p p p
u?
but now nm
cause i was missing the place
an hour ago
i was at campos like
yo m i l o
at least people are nice in silver
i love silbur
if games are long its cause they’re unwinnable but team is too dumb to surrender and theenemy team is too dumb to group up and stomp to close out the game
yeah
i never have close ranked games
yikers
D5 0 lp is much scarier than plat 1
:|
thankfully i didn't
sounds dank
o wat
u still on?
playing absolver
i was
now's the time to change it
like if you don't like beriham
that's a good amount of time
i don't like the fact that lees just
i've done it so many times with kindred
don't use up aa passives
that's ridiculous
his soldiers can't attack wards?
the removal of tracker's knife absolutely gimp him
his w's a little gay tho
like riven's
if you have half a brain
shits on everyone
and ww just
yeah
yeah
neither is irelia lmao
but like ww is so fucking unbalanced
same with irelia
thematically yeah
make his job actually difficult
he’s a drain tank
he doesnt need damage
lower his base ad to 56
fuck warwick
i goofed so hard
sor
most openers hit mid or high, right?
yea same
oh ok
you gotta block low then high immediately?
what do you do?
fighting games are the best
*absolver

hell yea
the gay one thats stupid op
but you dont use android big nig, right?

Hansa has few memories of his childhood, but they all begin after a short, yet vivid one of him being lead by one of the masters, down the long corridors of the monastery where he grew up. His small hand, gripped gently by the well worn and wrinkled ones of Master Parvat Sikhar Thand. His robes, a miniature replicate of the ones worn by the elderly man next to him, scratched along the cold stone floors. Everything in the monastery was cold when he was young, from the floors to the walls to the clay pots and pans, just moments after coming out of the firepits for the evening meals. The temple lay beneath the peak of the Pryat Naahn, where the cold will prickle your skin even through the thickest clothing. Yet despite the cold, Hansa remembers those halls filled with the echoes of soft music and the warm smiles of masters and students as they passed. The cold didn't touch those people. Hansa remembers those times fondly. Hansa was 12 years old when Master Thand died, with his passing a quiet fell over the monastery. The walls grew colder. The lamps burned duller. The halls and corridors lost their former luster. No longer could one hear the echoing of laughter around every corner, or the chimes of bells left in open windows for the wind to ring. The music hall was left empty, for there was work to be done. In Hansa's case, his studies and training overtook much of his free time. The masters pushed the young students into physical training, which meant combat.In all his years at the monastery, Hansa felt as if he were always a step behind the other children. He learned to read and write, late. He could never paint well, had trouble reading maps, always burned himself lighting candles. The only activity he found any true comfort in was music, but even that was taken away with the death of Master Thand. But when it came to combat, Hansa shined above all others. Hansa found that fighting and music were not all that dissimilar, and in practice bouts with the other children, Hansa danced to the beat of a deadly drum. Despite all this, Hansa was dismayed to find that his teachers didn't seem to appreciate Hansa's newfound martial prowess. "Agressive," they called him. "Belligerent, brutish, and hostile," they said in their reports to the masters. They believed Hansa exhibited traits unbecoming of a servant of the Daughter. He was reprimanded for his aggressive ways, and was separated from the other children, until he could learn to respect and love all his fellow beings.After two months of separation, Hansa came to an understanding while reading through the Scrolls of the Exalts for the third time. The issue was not with his skill in combat, but his eagerness to perform it. He was always the first to jump into the sparring ring, and the first to strike in any match. Any true disciple of the Daughter and surely any true hero worth counting among the Exalts, knows that a balance must be held between their duties and their desires. Hansa has been given a duty by the Daughter, to respect the world and its inhabitants, to be a beacon of peace, warmth, and hope for all to see. And if he cannot temper his desire to sing songs of violence, then he is undeserving of the title of White Chain. With his head bowed, he told his teachers thus, and they smiled.In the years that followed, Hansa completed his formal training with the other children, and earned the white chain he wears around his neck. At the Chain ceremony, Hansa and his peers were each given a scroll containing instructions for when they so choose to descend the mountain and look outward to the world for the next step of their training. And so Hansa packed his meager possessions, and made his way down the mountain.
don't tell me you have an accent on the e
i'll be
i'll go with
i've lost
i don't think so at least
now i've gotta make toughguy

niiice
and i can't get rematches
except it's cars on my street and not neighbors
but he'd be gemi chance if gemi chance ate bread scraps fro a living walked around with prayer beads and told everyone to "walk in peace," with a big ass smile on his face
i've figured out like where he's from and the most major points
honestly he's not even missing all the backstory
it's a half-parsa
if he's changing rn
but i didn't write that shit
i read it but didn't say anything
that wasn't me
i didn't do that
it'd be fine
that's not the problem
it's basically already dead
i've probably said it 50 times by now
it's absolute cancer
naw lol it's actually rly cool
for sure
RELIGIONYISUN IS THE ONE TRUE GOD AND THE CONSUMMATE SUM OF ALL REALITY.YISUN is all things, every thought and every mind, every death and act of violence. YISUN is the weakest thing there is and the smallest crawling thing, and the worm upon the earth and in the earth. YISUN knows all the universal songs and wields the transcendental powers of all reality, and burns in infinite fractal fire.YISUN is infinite, and with no equal, his existence was purely circular. It was a wretched, momentary existence, with infinite knowledge and nothing to share it with. So God rejected singularity and circular existence, and committed the first division: division of Self, Infinite, holy suicide. Upon the moment of his holy suicide, YISUN spoke the Seven Syllables of Roaylty in the language of the universe. These words would echo across the shapeless shapes of existence and never be heard by any. YS ATUN VRAMA PRESH  YISUN said: let there not be a genesis, for beginnings are false and I am a consummate liar.The full of it is this: the circular suicide of God is is the perfection of matter.YISUN lied once and said he had nine hundred and ninety nine thousand names. This is true, but it is also a barefaced lie. The true name of God is I.Living is an exercise of violence. Exercise of violence is the fate of living.Violence is circular. Perception is not circular and lacks flawlessness – therefore, rejoice in imperfect things, for their rareness is not lacking.Love of self is the true exercise of the God called I.Only a fool cannot place his absolute certainty in paradoxes. The divine suicide is a perfect paradox. A man cannot exist without paradox – that is the full of it.YISUN then destroyed himself to create the dual deities: YIS, the black flame, goddess of all that is, and UN the white flame, god of all that is not.These two beings saw each other and were shocked, for though they wielded an infinite art, they were separate. They were so horrified by one another, that they warred for seven years. Then they made love for seven hours. From their second division were born 777,777 gods in black and white, the multiplicity. These gods erected a tower in the void-heart of the universe from which they ruled and warred for eons. Constructing marvels of the arts across the expanse of space. When eventually they grew tired of infinity, they left their tower and each created an order of inheritors to sustain and bear witness to their mightiest works. They each picked a spot, gazing upon their most precious creations, curled into a ball, and whispered a song.Those 777,777 songs ignited the flames within them, arced across the vast expanse of space, burning shut the door to the tower of The Many, then back, and imbuing their inheritors with the hot fire of life.
i'll send you what i have so far on the religion when i get back
gonna see if building manager can use one of the spare keys
fml i locked myself outside
it's a writing class
it's this thing
the class isn't a college one
and that's okay
i've spent the better part of today just fucking planning this shit
then we're gucci
to remove an implant from it's lungs or something
that one's worth watching when it hits the tvs
and i don't count blade runner cause that was a psychological thriller
i can't remember the last good action movie that wasn't either mad max or made by tarentino
being an actor or a playwright wasn't even a good source of income unless you were shakespere
i think it's much easier, at least for a multi-million dollar project
that's what i like to see
that's some good ass back and forth
so they'll keep making them
if it's pg13 they'll bait that someone's gonna die then either save them or they miraculously survive
terminator just goes in and kills everything
idk how i'd translate that into dnd tho
maybe combat that's like The Dark Night
where a dude comes at you with a fucking shovel and it's actually scary
when you make a serious show but have a jedi that's literally shaggy
honestly it wasn't that good
yeah that shit's a little on the gay side
it's like the quintessential space opera thing
yeah it's not bad lol
in general dnd is a pretty "heroism" focused game
if not i'll make sure to not let him switch unless he dies
i'll probably try it out and see what you guys think
it'll have several corporate giants
im not sure how much lore i'll give you straight up
yeah that's been my thing so far
yeah that's the gist of it
and you'd probably encounter others on the way and have to fight over shit sometimes
that's dope
there'd need to be some sort of conflict and i'd probably center it around
"yea we live here now, fuck you guys."
it'd basically be like
um there are several planets that are "owned" by specific species and others that are coalition owned, and populated by a bunch of different species
but i don't even get it myself
fml it's just huge
i don't think it sent right
dopest shit i've seen in a while
oh yikes that's big
actually
YEA
OH
based on ranges and turns?
nice
o god no
walking the dogs
im just
no
itd be 5e
space age or naw?
bout setting
ok
i’d need a week or two before i was ready for anything anyway
aight
but only if team so desires
i do
i did call next so like
i could dm it
if everyone wants another campaign 
idk
i feel ya
yea i sort of get that
oh
?
its boolish
yea
eric’s a bool tho
and he was too loud
too often
much
it got too like
yeah
yea
i left it up to eric
idk when yew is gonna ollie outie
lmao
yea
its either a rogue or monk
ye
cause its inevitable now
whenever yew dies i’ve got one in mind
yea next weekend/week is all good
lemme know i’ll be there
aight
lmao
yea
o dope
tonight is the only night im free
yeah
im working saturday night
:/ no
okay
o sick
makes sense
ahh
it slowed down like a ton
yea
yea ya probably are
but thats 3 solid groups and a full week of school
if you count the ongoing 1 on 1 with uti i guess im in 3 too
agreed
sounds difficult 
you’re in 3 groups damn
dope
at matthew’s?
o?
hows everything going with you rn?
alright
dope
yeye
i'll have to do something to make gemi want to do that tho
broken
o yea
ye
but she’s also a dragon sorcerer with natural bonus ac
i know eao benefits less from armor than from not having it
idk
maybe but i think armor would fuck with some of his kenku shit wouldnt it?
or a fucking sorcerer if he wanted to be a caster so badly
or a trickery rogue
he shoulda played something less gay
i didnt
parsa would whine about something
yea
everyone would be like “o shit yes massa
it’d be your campaign you could just say “friday niggers, be there”
i can do it on fri if you want
i should know by tomorrow or the day after
ye thought so
lol
if you wanna push it back too, i can prolly do next friday as well
dope
and our hangout sesh?
like our campaign sesh
whats the word on the multiple things we’re gonna do?
i’m pretty good
ayy hows it goin vro
if you can get into somewhere from like one of your mom's friends it'll probs be best
you're not gonna wander out into the street cause u feel like it
but friday night's free
what happened :(
he's insatiable
diego's a monster
i mean he wasn't about to stop after the first time
but goddamn he's a god if it's true
i'll continue to act clueless
theres no way
because you can’t just be that wrong
triggered as shit after an hour and a half
oh god i got fuckin
yea
of 2 hours
the last 10 minutes
that was just like
the majority of that wasnt in the group chat
it's ridiculous
cause i've never seen someone be so fucking wrong
i can't handle it anymore
that's
i haven't gotten a haircut in like 6 months
:O
nice
i feel like that is definitely the case
yeah
frankly i havent played league in 3 weeks and i think thats a factor
das some good shit
yea if you dont you never do
i’ve been inspired in general lately
im sick of that shit
so like
and i never fuckin do it
i always say “im gonna write my book soon”
thats the thing
cause if we say some time it’ll never happen
invite whoever
i’ll fucking pay too
honestly, sooner rather than later
for sure
i feel u
fuck those guys
wat
nw
yea
acid is for people who wanna party and get laid
no heroine
no acid
nope
shit like that
in natural forms
and plant based substances
so she works with people
my mom is like a mediator for these things
at a mens retreat thing
it was 2 weeks after the first one
i had it described as working through anger
ye
on the ground
paralyzed for 30 minutes
i was like
so the other one
ye
you speak perfectly clearly too
in terms of processing things internally
shrooms speeds you wayy the fuck up
mentally
being drunk does that but it also like really slows you down
yea
weed doesnt do that
fucking tears down the walls you put up
it just
definitely
i c
feel
thats dope af
yea
idk high just doesnt do anything for me
it feels shitty going down too
enough
its not like
i dont think weed helps all that much tbh
yea
tipsy one is great
yea
its very difficult when you’re in a sober mindset
yea
yea
and expecting responses
i was asking “what is the architechture of your soul”
yea
thats pretty cool
i meant weird as in out of character but poignant i think
like i say weird but thats out of context
mushrooms wont do that
and receptive to information that comes from within or without
and like open
and idk it makes your head feel very charged
uti over skype
and asked some really weird questions to my mom and uti and our roomate at the time
and went through a lot of ideas with life and stuff and self discovery
i did some real soul searching shit
i mean the first time was awesome
i’ve had two very opposite reactions to them
and different
mushrooms are muuuuch stronger tho
well thats part of it
the problem is getting them
id be down
i feel like you would benefit from doing ceremonial mushrooms
milo
das good
and he likes things that are put bluntly
he’s just blunt
i dont think he’s tough
yep
thats parsa
theres that voice thing, the weird ego shit, and the warhammer obsession 
ye
ok cya
with the fuckin voice wtfffff
he talks like that 80% of the time
YEA WTF
what you mean?
fake?
some shit
parsa’s got
yea
eric?
i had a similar experience with some fags from middle school
you think you’d have been a better person for it?
why?
he still hates eric
yea
so i suppose he kept it well hidden
last year
i only found out like
ye
yes
i mean he had a real thing for sasha in 11th grade
you and sasha?
thats very likely
yes
mhm
i was just messing
yea
normie
...
that uti was such a 
i didnt realize
das a lot
wow
tru
distance
mostly cause like
he likely will, he’s distant in general
yea lol
for hours
the conversation will go on
care
yea thats fair
since he was crazy enough to try and listen to all the new music in 2017
i mostly ask uti
waddle through a mass of shit
you gotta like
the problem js that to find anything good
i feel u
ye
mhm
broad
very uh
but yea
to this
that generally goes from this
i like stuff in a wide range
personally
i see
i mean mine is too
its too random
i cant get a read on jett’s taste in music
yeah
(ok)
yep
that is true
yes
but i think that list disproves that
people like to try and say that there’s no such thing as natural terrible taste in music
yea
thats all the top 100s
i mean thats not all the songs
yep
ed sheeran reminds me of a horse’s dick
i disagree with his opinion of ed sheeran, but w/e
*music
i think he liked sam smith as a person more than his musi
yea
ironically
call me maybe was a banger
this guy confirms basically everything you just said
have you read this
ye
yea
theres a lot who do
90%
and thats mostly the same case with rap
nobody who makes pop actually gives a shit about music
pop is terrible
this makes me depressed
omg
thats fair not everyone will like it
but it was a very slow movie
i think it was better than the original
blade runner was
and even then mad max was just action
being really wowed by
mad max and blade runner have been the only recent movies that i remember like
movies are starting to suck too
nope
yea
kendrick was good in 2015
theres jack shit
yea
nope
thats some good shit
hell yea
more like 0/21
21 savage
“1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, bands in my bank acount x4”
no literaly
and people like that shit
and count that as a chorus
these days people count to fucking 8
so fucking quality
its so good
yea dude
kms
lil pump
and fucking
instead we get migos
i dont get why music cant be this good anymore
on another note
lmfao
i like ur style
the surprise shitstomp
yep
ie rn
dont wanna push boundaries rn when im just some retard the big company found for them
ye
if they take this pitch i’ll go all out though
not with this initial ideation stage
yea
thats sort of on the designer’s end tho
definitely
mhm
just well designed
it was not a well executed game
mhm
that was the real shit
it was breeding the dragons
and collecting dragons wasnt the thing
its tough
but i cant change that design
yea there game itself doesnt have anything like that
nothing drives competition like that
where you can visit other people’s cities and see their shit
yea
basically
it’d be good if they pulled a dragon town
i am
ye
nw
the plot twist
only combined with elmo
thats more like spec-ops the line
nope
and boom it reveals this twist that you’re actually a sick fuck
like the whole game you’re harvesting happiness
yea dude
nope
id make this shit so sad and dark and depressing
bruh im just sad this isnt entirely my game
exactly
yes
definitely
mhm
exactly
yea
if they think the bitch is annoying they can say “peace bitch”
like offer players a choice
tbh
im thinking both
and then it becomes about competing with other players and expanding n shit
im thinking the end of the story is either helping her go home or convincing her to stay
yea
*currency
cause right now the goal is collect currence
a goal rly
or like
a beginning and an ending rly
not much
still figuring out an ending tbh
tru
thats only if you promise titties
cause clickbait is bad
which is good
yep
straight disney princess
:/
she looks like this
she looks 16
they already designed her
nope
yes
im still writing it
yea
very important to not like go too deep into the bullshit
yea
yes
its a pitch for a story based on the stuff i got given
naw it's not
you don't even have to read it if you don't want
i'm gonna buy some more fucking daggers.
after it was cold all week
its been hot today
but i walked my own
i had a similar thing
whats goin on?
understandable 
i was like LMAO
ic
with his roleplaying
about seriously being serious
he’s just not that serious
i like jett
is the thing
eric doesnt want jett
i think he’s afraid jett will find out and be salty nobody’s told him anything
no he didnt say anything like that
huh
:/
tho
i definitely didnt wanna leave you out
no i think he did
what?
how's my cloak doing? am i on fire?
btw, eao's gonna be from tanderoon or something
We can't see you
that shits gonna be great
ive been working on perfecting the voice switch
noice
sunday’ll most likely be good too btw
i have to leave by 7:30
if it was a day shift ida been all, fuck yea lets go
late
:(
i do
more like a hive vagina
but its not a dude
theres one other miniboss thing
oh wait no
he’s the only dude there i think
naw i meant him
he was easy as fuck
the shit man?
did you ever kill the dude in the royal waterways?
yea lol
ic
did you ever get into the queen’s gardens?
theres so much more stuff
yea
holy shit
Real
the palace grounds
ye
ooo
or the hive?
kingdom’s edge
beneath the city?
which area it in?
maybe
ok lol
i like the story shit you learn from her
lmao
im currently filling out the map
0
no
but more fun
much more bullshit
and the second hornet fight is
kings path is great
yea
so maybe, maybe not
you just get a pale ore for it
that shit was fuckin terrifying
and king's path is probably my favorite area
i took my dogs for a walk then came back and killed him first try like he was the easiest boss in the game
what the fuck
s u r e
that's cancer
gonna see if i alt f4'd fast enough
np
yea
maybe that's too many plot points as well
She'll have had a ring from eao's dad, who'll probably be a dragon, but it's been stolen and she thinks I might have it. I don't so we make her way back to her home in a secluded valley somewhere in the mountains to help look for it. Have to kill some thieving fae demon that's been stealing from the valley, return almost everyone's stuff, and eao's mom gives her the ring
i was thinking of making the dragon dude be a white one, but eric's dragon is white, so i'll probably go red.
which'll be to own that entire fuckin valley, and meet her dragon dad.
and then there'll still be a goal to go after when it's over
if it's first that way it's not too heavy
She'll have had a ring from eao's dad, who'll probably be a dragon, but it's been stolen and she thinks I had something to do with it. Now both of us are pissed. And we make her way back to her home in a secluded valley somewhere in the mountains. Have to kill some thieving fae demon that's been stealing from the valley, return almost everyone's stuff, and eao's mom gives her the ring
well since it's gonna be earlier, i guess we'll go with the mom one
k
but you know more too
ye same
idk
if theres gotta be one i’ll leave it mostly up to you, but maybe it could have something like finding her long lost tiefling mother, or going into some dwarven mines to excavate a bigass crystal.
well i got messages from both eric AND barsa now and it seems like they’re worried samuel is gonna be boring without a questline
ok
"wake up in the morning and shit into my golden toilet, wash my hands in a crystal bowl and eat freshly carved roasted pork, adorned with gold shavings."
i guess the whole point of the character is to start off as a secretive, lying, cheating, selfish, uncaring, evil bastard, and slowly become a regular slightly less selfish evil bastard who cares about a couple people, even though she probably won't admit to it.
wow i'm retarded
that'll trigger me
i was fuckin
naw its chillin
finished all ur finals
a i c
ey bilo did you end up coming to school?
fuckin surprise me
i’ll leave it up to you

vroooo, whenever you wake up, check both of my bios and lmk if it's all okay. a lot has changed. pretty sure i went from a sorcerer to a secret tiefling jew sorceror.
o wait

ye
less than 500 bucks
basic bitch ass intel hd graphics

its completely improbable
ik
&gt;...&gt;
...
we gotta stop him
o god
the only time getting a tattoo from a book is acceptible is when you wrote the book
nonono
no
i won one game and lost one game :P
[3:30:15 PM] corduroy queen: the mechanics grew on me though

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
well put together
looks solid
i finished reading all the updates last night
im willing to play yours
as far as campaigns go
works
just make sure that before you copy the link it's set to comment
when you invite people you can select whether they can view, comment or edit
it's also not like stuff on roll 20 or something that you feel like you have to use.
"Also we're just gonna stop the old campaign we were playing for this new stuff that i started working on two weeks ago."
"Also we're just gonna stop the old campaign we were playing for this new stuff that i started working on two weeks ago."
"Here's the world you'll be playing in, this is literally everything that's in it, and if you don't read all of it and follow all of my rules I'm gonna be pissed"
vs
"Here's the world you'll be playing in, this is what it's like."
cause the difference is like
and making a world map and a bunch of extra rules and expecting people to join
there's a difference between making a world doc and then asking people to join
sort of
well
no
yeah
so him finally figuring out what he likes is great
i don't hand haven't really ever wanted to dm for milo and jett
frankly im kinda glad
yeah
still pretty chadly
an entirely incorrect opinion but
"tabletop&lt;video gays"
"I'd rather just play terraria."
surprising as fuck
milo essentially just axed eric's campaign
i'd run it for you, seems interesting
i mean
in a bit
but
i don't have the time to read it rn cause im workin
biased doesn't mean bad
oh my god it's a setting
is this an essay?
whoops
lol
;p;
?
im washing my hands of the conversation for today
it's in the chat.
done
nice
this link should give comment permissions
if you cant comment
who cares
you can comment it
actually
not gonna happen
nope.
ah
what four words?
what?
gachi gachi
xd
yeah.
but you keep bohering me so now you get to watch me write it if you want
it's not done
here
it
on
Working
I'm
we'll see what this does
but im writing a big rant
yeah
if i do he'll blame you 
if i don't he'll blame me
no
if i stay he's gonna have to change his dm style cause i hate that shit
ok
skype made quoting people a massive pain
that was a pain in the ass
good
that's it
Woman feelings talk over
just tell me. ill try to work shit in so that game goes better as long as you guys stay involved in it. Trying to make this more group involved so help me make this better so we all have more fun
hell if you want to include something in the town to fit you better
and for everyone NOT parsa if you dont like your character or want to flesh out the backstory or rework smth
asking for a little involvement shouldnt be unreasonable. read the handouts. participate in rp and converse among the council to try and figure whats best for town. be in combat. usually were all good on this, just a little more is nice
just like. read the chat guys. that and the important handouts i dont think is that much to ask considering how much goes into buliding campaign
never mind, fuck it.
also if its a time thing then we can do earlier friday so its not as tiring by the session end
oh he's not even in here
or 3 chances to figure out what he wants
give him 3 characters
so idk i kicked him but we dont have to
I'd argue let him swap characters
and want to swap characters
its demoralizing when people (parsa) say directly to your face they both dont care and havent read anything
it's also session 2
ok
the tldr is lets keep playing but give me more investment. like not getting knockout faded or drunk and being involved in the rp AND combat
and the rules and herbalism and shit I thought are at least interesting
and that kinda sucks since even if the writing isnt great it still took time
right i wasnt planning to its just like. theres already all this work and im still not sure people have read the handouts
so you've got a lotta shit in there, maybe don't put so much work into the sessions and use what you've got instead? also all of us have been expecting our characters to die since the beginning. so.
this next bit is going to not be 100% accurate because i don't want to copy my own block of rebuttal
but mars is right that dnd each week is pretty fun so stopping is also shitty
cause like rn it feels like I put all this work in and get excited for session and then dont get that back which is why i was thinking about taking a break as the work doesnt feel appreciated/worth it
and like feedback each week is nice since otherwise all I hear is parsa flaming me
whoops
so Id like maybe 15% more engagement and investment
so Id like maybe 15% more engagement and investment
anyway im just tryna say I wasnt perfect but I put a lot of work into campaign
thats fair. though you did cause a major scene with the burning mine and they were panicked after the earthquake
and not just a mob of assholes with demands
like all of them
the only way to make us care about the townsfolk is to make them feel realish
I will add
and that you care about the townsfolk which is fair
mars also pointed out i fucked up too cause I shouldve insisted backstories be fleshed out more so people get into character
(it is)
like i dont think its that much to ask that people spend like 20 minutes before session 1 reading the handouts right
(90% sure this isn’t a direct quote didn’t double check)
 and ik parsa directly told me he doesnt care about campaign, so between that and the implied indifference it made me feel like all the work that went into it was wasted
 but what Im trying to say is that I personally really like dnd each week. except when you guys show up late and then tell me you actually don't want to play after we've been waiting for 2 hours really kills any excitement about it
 and this is gonna be really shitty since talking about feelings is for women and i cant really express it all that well
but ngl that is the opposite of what i was hoping to convince you of
(transposing between conversations is difficult and takes a fucking second shut up
 i was gonna just say that with a tldr "fuck parsa" as a meme but i guess i kinda should say more meaningful stuff
i guess it is your take from the conversation
well
 what
well after talking with mars he made me realize its not that i want to stop doing campaign its that it feels like shit to run the last 2 weeks cause parsas negativity really sticks when I spend like 30 hours prepping shit
didn’t work so i just said fuck it and now im making pasta
im gonna do that
i don’t disagree with you
and im not gonna tell you everything he can do
also romulus is a tricky motherfucker
but
kevin might make you make a strength check
well if they're held, you can just take both their weapons out of their hands, right?
hmm
that combo's actually pretty sick
nvm
oh no, i do
i don't think I have hold person on Roman rn
oh
it's not too bad
he won't be on the problem team so
yeah
but for command it can cuck me
it takes their action
so
the scholar can also make people reroll their saves against being charmed.
esp in these pc vs pc fights
but once you're stunned for one turn you're kinda fucked
or a slightly more limited version of it
i gave him stunning strike
yes.
just got a 20 off of rolling 10
this scholar has a +5 initiative and can roll superiority to add a d8 to initiative rolls
definitely
also terror would be in the middle of them
if they pass all the dex saves they'd still be a problem
fireball thunderstorm shatter
yeah it would
gadalf the whitler is gonna be a silly build for sure
that squad is gonna be terrifying
honestly
well kev gave me two sheets
right
ghengah
or romulus
paladin?
with attilor, ivlvia, helios and uh
but that wouldn't fit too well with the retard rip and tear IN squad
yep
Gadalf the Whitler
fucking christ
jesus
and he only uses fire spells
i can make a wizard named Grayndolf The Whitler
i aint aboutta do another roman emperor
you did julia kaisar
technically romulus and remus are not conquerers
i thought the theme was conquerers
we're doing
yeah
yeah
10 daggers, yes
yeah
yeah he's designed to fuck her up
you can step of the wind to dash as a bonus action and never be in range for him to attack you
you have 40 movement, right?
and he never had a chance at keeping up with vain
true
we can just walk away
but yeah
he doesn't want his reaction for that anyway
that shits broken
yeah
20 rn
he's already got a +10 to athletics, a +11 isn't gonna be earthshattering
yeah
the only uneven stat is a 15 in charisma
or i can just put it in charisma and not change anything
and drop one off his ac
so i can put the 17 back into strength for him to have 20 str
and i have 1 point that can be put anywhere
i also realized i calculated the stats wrong for the barbarian
if i didn't have the stats for it it'd be a real problem
it's really just a battle master that starts at level 1
gonna go with that scholar class kevin keeps touting
well echo knight's a bust
when i get the sheet sure
yea
this isn’t very poggers
i dont want to fight all these 20 ac enemies
christ
still pretty not poggers all things considered
i suppose
as stated by the spell
a familiar or an unseen servant is a subservient celestial, fiend, or fey being
well
if he does i'll drive to colorado and eldritch blast his fucking house
he better not
that's a free spell for me
ez clap
yeah
1 hp
it has
not sure
it's in an official book 
of course romulus remulus would be an echo knight
im really dumb
i don't think throwing shit at people would be outside of their playbook
and remus is the cuck that lets himself get backstabbed
romulus is kind of a backstabbing cunt
not really
hmm
he gets proficiency in that shit regardless
if i take tavern brawler
but
since it's improvised
i think it'd be treated as an improvised longsword or something so he wouldn't have proficiency
rather than throwing anything practical
he'll throw the swords when he's out of range
i fucked up the name
fuck
im feeling like im just gonna give romulus remus a shitton of swords
you're contractually obligated to do that now
you're contractually obligated to do that now
oh my god.
gotta keep it kinda different
Romulus Remulus
i won't be able to get it unless i look at it
nah im good
*true
truee
Ivliva
sorry
you make Ivlia
i'll make Romulus Remulus
*fk it
ok fk i
my god
spelt in actual roman lettering/
i don't know who that is
honestly i think a straight bum rush would fuck us up
then go for Alex the Very Good, and Romulus Remulus
the whimpy beta mage?
and saladin
alexander the great a fighter?
or Goliant Dave
as in David Goliath
or david and goliath
i'd say alexander the great
he'll probably note the names and do it.
we'll see what he does.
i did ask kevin to put the ranger and the grappler together
assuming that, yes
i'd make a rogue to abuse the grappler's grappling.
and i knew what you were making?
if i absolutely had to make something
xd
a spear chucker?
i only wanted to make the grappler
nothing
you and new guy carried pretty hard
lost me too
true
i think if we lose terror we instantly lose
and im excited to fucking instantly lose.
i think we designed these npcs to be way harder fights then kevin ever throws at us
lol
has mage slayer?
the paladin?
what the fuck
that is kinda huge
TRUE
with god on their side, a paladin is never without a weapon
a punch is a melee weapon attack
paladins can smite with their punches.
without those 19 crits she's kinda boof
but the upgraded ones are the worthwhile ones
right
to be useful
the ranger needs those battle axes
and one trident
*daggers
and he has a total of 10 dagger
he doesn't need a weapon to shove someone prone
yeah
i'd need to first command drop then command prone/flee.
i'd need to first command drop then command prone/flee.
we're kinda fucked
i have no reason to not do as far as i know
which
which means if i open with a fireball
two of four possible spells
basically forces roman to use two spells to get him off of whoever he grapples
both are beneficial
drop would be the same
or the weapon
release might release the grapple
could end up throwing a knife at one of us with throw
depends on how kevin interprets it,
LOL
yeah
barbarian
all dex saves
he's got advantage to saves vs fireball
than we are the big hitter type
especially considering our team is more of the death by a thousand cuts type
honestly half orc is more reliable
no, he doesn't actually need the lifting capabilites of goliath
half orc could probably work better
but
goliath
im hoping this is it
roman has yet to meet a moment where he's been proven he's not hot shit
roman thinks he's got this shit in the bag
im roleplaying it
he's just crowd control
he's not the main source of damage
so he definitely needs the expertise for the +10
the original problem is that grappler stops his own movement, but by shoving them prone he can just drag the target back to his team and they can't get up until they break free
and i roll stats that aren't complete ass.
or in eric's if the crocodile dies
tbh i might just play this fucker in one of milo's games
then he's got perma advantage for himself and your ranger
it's to abuse grappling and shoving to prone them so they can't get up.
no the point is still to grapple
hmm
i'll give him expertise in intimidation
yeah
so he's just got a +1 to his wisdom saves instead of a +2
i'll swap the barb's wis and charisma
maybe
maybe i should not do that.
then i optimized him.
but
i had originally planned to do that
well
Roman is gonna fucking die
they're all monsters
we definitely can't
needed
honestly
yeah i definitely agree with that.
he'll nerf it after the first fight
this is so absolutely fucked
but yes you can take reactions
with a tower shield, he can't use his reaction to make an opportunity attack in the first place
that last point
• If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you using your shield.

• If you aren't incapacitated, you can add your shield's AC bonus to any Dexterity save made against a spell or other effect that affects only you.

• If you are subjected to an effect which allows you to make a Dexterity save for half damage, you can use your reaction to take no damage, interposing you shield between you and the effect.
and still use his massive fucking shield to block everything
so he can grapple&gt;shove terror prone, her speed is 0 so she can't get up. start beating the crap out of her with advantage
damage
no.
he takes
and if he saves
and with danger sense he gets advantage and gets to add that+3 bonus to dex saves on spell effects on top of that
with a tower shield he's got +3 to ac
esp if your ranger is melee
compared to shield master
i just realized the grappler feat sucks
wait
of intellect
no im gonna go for the headband
actually
i get 10
no
wait
cause of that extra 600 gold
i get 5 sharpened daggers that crit on a 19
if i forgo a magic item
wait
pretty sure it was 50 last i checked
tru
im dumb
*full 10
*full 12
and kevin is ruling them as a full d10
im pretty sure minor healing potions, bought are 50 gold
or it's a good 4 level 1 spells
that's a lot of healing pots
yeah my thoughts exactly
that's kinda boring
but
i could forego a magic item and just get plate armor
i mean i could tell him the gameplan
can't expect him to play to my gameplan
so in order to make it bullshit i've gotta give him something more passive than that
true
too bad
i want him to have bolas
fuck it
i'll ask kevin to vet it
feels bad
what about bolas
hmm
feels shit man
rly
smoke the arena, net terror, then grapple her
if i take the gladiator background I get a free net
jesus christ
yep
* entertainer background
acrobatics and performance
atilla the hunter, conquerer of the squared circle
gotta give him the performer background
to spice up the build
now
alright
that skin on skin contact
he wants as much F R I C T I O N as possible
considering he's the one that wants to grapple?
wouldn't the oil work against him?
lmao
he's a real grecian apex man
headband of intellect lul
these combats don't really go that long
upgraded
5 throwing implements
well
oh
and upgrade them unreasonably
hows about I take 50 throwing implements
lmao
and throwing hammers too, yeah
throwing knives
he's a rogue
i don't know
advantage right
oh
+10 when raging
+8 on a level 5 retard character
whelp
yeah
im not
no
oh my fuck
can't get sneak attack
doesn't work
turns out i was
i was double checking to see if i was an idiot or not
no
lol
there was no milo session one
milo session one?
?
sorry Gengah
you can be Ghenga Khan and I'll be Attilor the Hunter
i haven't gotten there yet
with her insane crits and huntard's mark
3 attacks a turn with advantage
he just holds one person down and she wails on them
honestly having her and the grappler on the same team would be disgusting
the half ork is the ranger, right?
uh. maybe.
...
that doesn't usually happen
i actually laughed irl
fuck
lul
even im not enough of a degenerate to do that
REALLY NOW
really
the one that inted to a giant purple worm
it was a retard character i ran in milo's game
i don't have to
but
Dar Lionslammer to piss you off
i was gonna name him
maybe
holy fuck
i assume you expect them to come as a group?
in theme
they fit together
but honestly
i didn't say it
you said it
they are the opposite of weak yeah
and i really want to put that blue tiefling in her place
kevin probably wouldn't have a grappler
yeah i just thought
it's perfect
nice
that's a quality image where tf you find that
that second one im gonna use
yeah
and
yeah
im gonna take it
hahaha
pin her and beat the shit outta her
bear totem grappler
storm herald would make her stronger
no
gonna make a barbarian that's designed to ruin terror
i rolled some fucking good stats
almost
no
completely unresponsive as far as i can tell
yes.
idk
no?
and that'll be it
cause eventually he's just gonna say "fuck it im gonna chop this thot's head off"
whether or not we decide to fight this rei girl will really depend on how bored jett gets in session
that we weren't gonna ask cause we don't care
but all you did was ask like 5 questions that he wasn't prepared to answer
maybe
because that other thing was the focus of the campaign for like two seconds
who then decided on a whim to switch domain and gods just two sessions ago
who's main quest to free gemi from some eternal fuckoff battle is the goal of the entire campaign
then played a character who is gemi lite who worships gemi in game
this is the guy who played gemi chance
first mistake
trusting milo
again
we've only just met this person nobody knows or cares enough to actually want to kill her or not want to kill her
like
with very little fore or afterthought
and just says shit
milo just does shit
when it comes to dnd
you forget
well here's the thing right
oh yeah
refer to what
all i wanna do is throw erics campaign as far off the rails as i can
something.
i guess thats
nice
she wants to use it until she has no use for it left
borrow it from who?
it's not ours
oh guess we should probably not give her the thing then!
oh hey that's exactly what we want to do but with a different fucking country
she wants this relic to take back to her country
since he literally set up this npc to have a goal that runs counter to our own goal
it shouldn't have tilted him
for the most part we don't ask him shit
it's surprisingly easy to do
lmao
you did.
then they'll be set
they just need a dedicated climb and jump button
honestly their physics system has improved a fuckton since then.
except then i went and bought the game.
yeah see i saw that shit too
but now i fuckin go into the arena and wreck face and i kinda feel incredibly good about myself.
you're not wrong
fuck my life
the combat is fun after you sink 20 hours into it to get used to it
either way
an absolute rat of a gamer
god dam unit that one is
mhm
thats how he describes himself
thats literally him
jewish fat lesbian youtube
dude
but i don't watch much beyond that
i like his tarkov stuff
alright i'll have to check that out
general sam?
i been had it for a while but i've never been good enough at it to recommend
you ever hear of this game called examina?
this one right here
best videogame song in a long time
aight get in here
league?
and now jett and i are playing duck game
but they quit
i was
ok thanks for not allowing me to your ted talk
.
rediscovering my hate for league of legends
was busy
i can do mine
sorry
i agree
no mordhau exra gay
hmm
but giru makes that shit look fun as fuck
ik mordhau big gay
and the you feels are not good so thanks
im still gonna do that shit i said i’d do
i guess
so
none of them had any helpful comments for me
nobody did
oh?
gotta keep up the hardass facade
*not
probably nit
but if he doesn’t make it to the next one im not sure if i’ll keep him
im giving him a lotta leeway since it’s his first game
no
 yes
and push start time back to 7
im gonna stick to 4-5
yeah
that is frankly fucking ridiculous 
i spoke to them and apparently they’re used to like 5-8 hour sessions
next time
but whatever
yeah
cause like they were all kinda geared toward the same thing
one thing im gonna do is stop allowing so many persuasion attempts in a row in a conversation 
but im going to
no
alright thanks
yes
and then the prisoner
the goliath
definitely too long
i way agreed
yes
scale of 1 to 10, how not shit would you rate that first session
alright
jfc you’re probably right.
ok here i need you to hop on roll 20
oh im going to
i want to make everyone see my fucking train map.
i don’t think i’d lose him
ech
or we delay till next week
if he doesn’t make it i drop him
first, votes on keeping devin?
ok
i know
hmm
yes
they’re pretty magic
oh yeah
no mages again then?
in fact they only have the worst girls
no best girl
shitty route
terrible class
blue lions suck
hmm
k
up?
oh god stayed up till 4 making maps
and im gonna make every excuse in the book to use it from here on out.
frankly, i'm very proud of my train
if not tomorrow is cool too
and are you willing to check something out?
you up?
but thanks
and i'm honestly probably not worried enough
most of it is theater of the mind
m just rushing
i'll be ready
this is your fault
i blame you for this
spent all my time playing divinity 2 when i shoulda been making maps
i fucking
shit
i kinda wish i didn’t open that chest
but i like that poor deluded tall ass motherfucker too much
ifan is also sick
im a fan of the red prince
game is fun
yeah yep
so
in pretty much every way
way better than divinity 1
alright so its got a slowish start but this game’s actually pretty good
and that will determine it
i’ll probably ask you for an insight check on friday 
wether or not you understand this is up to
horace is a hardass, and he kinda treats you like shit but it’s because he has very high expectations of you
you finished your 2 weeks in brelan and are taking the train up to aundair
helping with post war reparations in the name of the silver flame
You were doing some community service shit
lets say horace was currently taking you on a pretty long form circuitous mission from Thrane to Brelan to Aundair and back. 
hmm
yes
to you specifically 
he’s a complete asshole
you don’t like him
k
heads
there are things i can do with each but i don’t want to make the decision for you
but you decide do you like horace or dislike him
i like that you’re estranged from your parents
well hm
yeah
im going to use it
do you care?
and div wizard is fun as hell
ye theres nothing that says you have to have the religion be part of your class
you can always just be religious 
i mean
nah play what you want
sweet
oh?
thats all i need to know rly
what sort of cleric are you?
still have 1 more dude who hasn’t chosen 
1
stack roles idc
you can be whatever 
currently an eldritch knight a druid and a cleric
im gonna be at my dads so i probably won’t be able to respond to shit anyway 
you don’t have to accept immediately 
right now
im gonna add you to the discord i made
and yeah the shapeshifters are great
not the robots
and the guns but really the trains
but i really just picked eberron for the trains
im probably gonna turn down the ridiculous bullshit knob because as dm i can just do that
cancer
wow my skypes lagging
on that
hard agree
plus we’d get to make fun of dumb weebs and their dumb weeb bullshit after sessions
but i figured i’d offer anyway 
ik, you said it’s got too much
want in? or are ya busy?
Starting in january im running an eberron campaign, for my friend jonah and a few weebs i met while living in san francisco.
too bad
well
fair
im probably gonna keep christmas shopping then
k
what’s the word on milo and jett?
haha look at me using zoomerisms like a massive faggot
bet
oh aight 
but i’ve learned not to make promises 
im gonna see about getting a haircut before 7. I should be back in time cause i have fucking 4 hours
cool
yeah
ok
any time
tomorrow?
uh
idfk
yeah
is kinda close
gold dr manhattan
yeah essentially lol
detailed details
or
my mouth will remain closed when discussing details
not all the people, but yeah
yes
it's better that way
and yes worm is only text
haven't had a chance to call back
i've been busy
atlanta
oh
i was giving you time to finish your bullshit deadweek
?
im just gonna copy it from alix's
uh
very well run
sounds like you may actually take over with your campaign
i’ll run an eberron campaign 
if eric drops
starting say winter break
anyway
i don't
i have vicious mockery but that's a joke
i didn't take any damaging spells
for some reason it seems like you really don't like my changeling whisper bard
wolves aint direwolves
hounds aint wolve
they're dogs man
why?
and soap
good thing my diplomats pack comes with some
i'm gonna have to buy a vast array of perfumes
use them?
can you maybe not?
i don't really want to kill dogs.
i see
for when i eventually do fuck up
*no
oh not
who tf knows i exist?
you put a bounty hunter on me?
wtf
idk i think i wouldn't mind being banished to eberron as much as i would being drawn and quartered
xd
well that'd be too bad
oh
automagically?
see my race?
what?
it's like identity theft
oh i know changeling/doppleganger is a quick behead on sight under any circumstances
right
and am a human
good thing im not monstrous
lol
oh
do you mean let you pass?
catch?
i mean
and what he did
and why
asking him who cursed him
i'm just gonna keep
lmao
ok
like quarter rats
not even half
they're fake half-rats
also wererats aren't rats
well yeah they're great
skaven are
and are in fact evil spirits
but rakshasa are not cats
but otherwise hell naw
i'd roll that
and if ever someone decided to LET me be a rakshasa
i'd play something reptilian, sure
i don't think i'd ever play a character with fur in dnd
i didn't think it'd be him
i was wondering who was gonna go dark first
at least with this group
he's the first to roll a tabaxi in any of our campaigns
hfs
ic
is he a human variant?
lmao
in kev's game
i was gonna do that with my warlock
my boy too nice for that
but i doubt i can properly impersonate a bandit
hahah
i mean i can fuck with their paperwork if i can manage to get in there
good thing im not neutral or evil
it does seem that way
until i buy more
so i'm limited by that
i only have one set of clothes
*mean
i men
yeah
the clothes just don't change with it
yeah i can
is what i mean
or some innocuous dumb kid
or some innocuous pretty lady
i can always become some innocuous old guy
but i can only copy people i've seen before
i can technically shapeshift into anything i want
ik
yep
the point of changeling is a free unlimited disguise self
im dumb enough to actually use that?
you think
esp when i take off my mask and am human beneath
i don't think he knows
they don't get to know
i haven't said shit
okay
i won't stop
and i won't stop
yes
no it won't be fucking terrible, only to you
yes i'm going to rhyme in normal conversation in character
a few questions to answer before you even read it
it'll probably come about when i start playing the character
did i include anything very explicitly detailed? no
did i include formative experiences outside the house? no.
im not changing anything anymore
finished it
sure sure
i’ll leave it there
what you know about roman is not what kevin knows about roman
uh
i told him the overarching concept
but you keep sayin shit to me
i just wrote it and didn’t talk to him
nope
? no
and mostly preforms with that or his lute
kid has a talent for card tricks and card games
sounds like it could be fun for you
you can make the dad’s character then
ok you got it
kid leaned hard into the jester thing
okok
if he ever goes home that shit would be burnt down
the dad is cutting ties forever
okok
why not?
yes
i don’t plan on it
im gonna say he was part of an adventuring party in eberron and his wizard accidentally sent him through a wormhole during their final battle with a lich or something 
yes
so now i am
i wasn’t gonna involve planar mishaps unless you pointed out the eberron thing
im glad you brought it up though cause
but you asked me to give you what i had now
i was going to
i told you this
home
im not
well yeah i thought that was the point of this kid never leaving his house
well technically the kid was born in faerun
i am a glutton for punishment 
yessssssss
just gayer
doppelgängers are the same thing
to faerun?
can we say the dad planeskipped?
dopplegangers kinda gay tho
oh
hes not a jester
c e r t a i n l y  not
i picked the race/class combination that is pretty much guaranteed to get me killed on sight no matter where i go
i know
i know
i thought it out i aint stupid
thats why twice a year
yes
but now he’s cutting ties
his father has a lot of enemies that he wanted to hide his son from
and barely
finds out that day that changelings like himself and his father are very rare
on his 21st birthday his dad gives him the family rapier, a pack full of shit, and a letter from an old acquaintance of his 
only goes out twice a year in full disguise 
kid almost never goes outside the house
aside from teaching the kid the arts of trickery and all that, he really doesn’t tell him shit about shit about the world
the kid models himself after his dad
the dad
kind of has a fetish for pranks
is a member of the college of whispers and trains his son to be the same
you see where this is going
fancies himself a jester
the father is exceedingly wealthy and extremely eccentric
i will once i check the map
not sure
either waterdeep or baldur’s gate
was raised in a city with his dad
the character 
idk i think they are afraid of your massive amount of willpower 
so my guy still unnamed rn
w/e 3 is a crowd
hm
in eric’s group chat
not to me
ah yes he said he wasn’t gonna do it
idk
oh
milo said miles wasnt bout it?
?
just need to look at a map for the small details 
pretty much got it
at work thinking bout it
yes
that seems hard to hold person
i like
so what you want the bbeg to be a fighter with a REALLY big sword?
it was the same with kev’s
its not real, just a joke
sounds like a laugh
i do know that
yes
eeeeexactly
and what better bard for that?
i just like to go places where i shouldn’t 
im a goodboy
yesssss
yes
im playing a college of whispers bard and there's nothing you can do to stop me
pfft
should i pick it back up that looks stupid as fuck
hajahahah
oh my god
wait rly
ok
read it
no i didn’t 
dude my ears couldn’t handle the orange guy
don’t you dare cancel that game of yours
yes
LISTEN HERE YOU FUCKING INGRATE
sure
xd
lol
yours is EXTERMINATUS
eric’s is The Most Wrong You Could Possibly Be
lmao
because it reaffirms his skype name for me
i like to let him talk when he gets like this
yes
yeah but now he won’t respond and it won’t cause problems 
you get to talk shit
yes
i, too, want to kill myself
lmao
why?
what?
it's a good thing the only squishy mage in party will be milo
i can set a house on fire and run away
i like slow burns
*there
that's alright, we'll get thee
lmao
you literally introduced me to animated spellbook
but i saw that video too, and i want it
i know you saw that video, sir
and maxes fire damage
that ignores fire resistances
i'll be playing an arsonist gold dragon sorc
i mean
HAHA
interacting with the npcs can be a bit like driving your car into a house
is a ton of fun
and the combat
i think the adventures themselves
this is an objectively correct opinion
xd
that's dumb as fuck
and not witch hunter cleric?
why tf is it called light cleric
oh right cause light is the only one with access to fireball
really?
i have no idea how to play cleric and light cleric seems like the shittiest one
i do as well
down to level 1 shit
yeah
and everyone rerolling characters
im down with resetting
idk
fair
but they're debuffed from someone else's
lolwat
it's fair
if miles gets 1 autocrit
i need to hear it
ok
yep
everyone
well i know who won't get to hear any of this.
fucking sick
fire or corpses?
what’d you kill them with
the whole town?
that’s fucking metal
wait you killed your hometown?
once we’re the ducal entourage we can do whatever we want
well
depose church and kill archbishop?
miles’ entire character?
isn’t that
when?
later
we’re allowed to do that
fuckin LOL
is an anime
eric’s world
i just realized 
what’s your character’s goal?
i mean
and we knew that walking in
but eric has a hardon for power words
yeah that shits dumb
xd
with the alert feat
the assassin is a lvl 20 assassin
well
why is the archbishop anything other than a lvl 10 cleric
it is dumb
lmao
there are so many fighter subclasses
like 4e warlord but on a massive scale
thats kinda sick
with a genius plan inspired entirely by miles
i just came up
.
or a bullshit magic item
gives you much more shitty minions
or B
that either A buffs the minions you control 
i want you to have a rune
is that the max?
you don’t want bullshit to even the playing field?
some bullshit to even the playing field
idk
for you to get a rune to bolster your skeleton army
i will attempt to make an appeal
ok
eric should just let you make yours up
i think
i think yours needs to be completely reworked
yes
and he has advantage on everything he does
and i think he gets a few bonus reactions
he gets a round of +10 ac and bonus to saves
to get you guys to go for the storm ones
that said i tried
not at all
jett apparently gets to see the future
completely retarded
yes
no
yes.
but
and im not sure if eric’s changed it since
*he’ll
he’ss post it next session 
jett doesn’t deserve it
cause as is its stupid
yours needs to be reworked to fit the character 
you’ll see why i say autocrit
once you see that
ok
has he told you jett’s?
actually 
i think miles should be buffed to auto crit
they’re really dumb
no definitely not
what even the fuck.
.
so
but apparently my rune bullshit is 30% lifesteal
it works
so long as it’s 1 sneak attack per person per round
yeah if i counter a different target
counter is objectively better now
actually yeah i do
no i don’t 
wow kms i really did hard cuck myself with the no magic thing
is that what eric said?
then you can base it off those games
unless you’re in eberron or faerun
lvl 7 is small pp
disagree
no
that way we can just be bozos and have a place to fall back and invest our money into
but i’d like it more if most of our in game activities didn’t have anything to do with it
i like the management shit
ok
stop trying to justify/not justify the toxicity idc
milos the pussy
i don’t complain about it
telling me this shit
you
why are
i know
?
7’s lower than 10 i know eric he wants to get to a point where we’re doing paragon tier shit
and level 7 is only as big as you make it
3 that one was a given
l o l
if you want to
ok
oh
i don't understand that statement without the context
wait what?
?
maybe now your workload won’t be so damn stressful
if you’re not having fun with it then I’m gonna be the last person to try and argue with you
but w/e
wanting to do and doing are different 
that’s not how that’s spelled.
and i’ll just keep blasting stupid ideas at eric’s game with no one to keep me in chexk
or you can
also means we can focus on a better game
and i can tell it was definitely not helping in that regard 
gotta preserve the mental
if that’s what’s best for you
:(
which, you should
or you go without me
that starts next week
same
im gonna be not retarded for a moment and say i’ll probably be home at 10
but if you’re making something i’ll at least show up
i won’t be there at a reasonable hour
your quarterly check ins will happen no matter what.
your deadlines will blow up in your face
a pretty good simulation of office life
i guess it’s uh
so nvm
i mean you hadn't tried it
well
why did you sign up for that?
november finals
ye
fucking lol
TRUE
so
talking in character
yeah you were also
when i bring it up im just messing with you
i know that
thats true yes
which thing?
glad that's over
it seemed like you were stressed with all that midterm crap last week
i wanted to check in with my friend.
i was asking cause
sorry
how are you doing?
sup man
i see
i don’t mind him being a heartless bastard 
why not?
oh
but if the party finds out about the shit you do when you’re alone there will be problems
so it could be pretty easy to empathize with him
i noticed that you kept talking about being homeless
so i have no problems
and this party is essentially a ridiculous bullshit machine right now
i play the game for the ridiculous scenarios
im just guessing 
no
i don’t care
i mean
but i think that’s cause you’re encroaching on her blood hungry punk asshole corner that she’s carved out for herself 
only alix had a problem out of character 
i think in character mostly
and be justified 
so when you fuck up hard enough i can kill you
i need to play a paladin one of these days
i know
20-25 min
bus&gt;red line train&gt;bus or train
from studio city yes
on train
lmao no im just fucking with you
but itd make more sense for him to be 24
25
kind of, yeah
i meaaaan
all you my guy
luckily for me i don’t plan on using the greenhouse any time soon
but idk, maybe we’ve just gotta steer you clear of the church that’s fucking sitting on our property 
plants growing out of control is great for our purposes i guess
its a cool god, i thought you like co-created it with eric cause of the “i don’t knows” but its dope
 huh
lmfao nice
did eric make the god?
great
so you’re keeping the token
*ic
ic iv
this sounds like a primordial chaos type god
burning wheel full of wings and swords?
is it like a primordial angel type thing?
and yeah sure
penny likes people who are useful. so most of your characters tend to fit the bill
great
is that permission to have noxalas as a permanent bard in my tavern?
as a hireling?
but yeah ik that
i liked the bard and was curious 
ok
and more of an off brand wizard
milo’s barely a cleric
idc about stacking classes
are you planning on retiring the bard for the cleric?
oh ok
just don't talk to yourself cause apparently that pisses the other monkeys off
or just pick whichever you prefer and when noxalas comes up, (which he won't) you can do his voice or something
*character testing
you also can get all the build testing you want to do out of your system
that way you can just throw in a one off character that doesn't matter for this mission
he hires someone else to do it
when the party has something noxalas wouldn't do
but flavor it as this
keep the bard
i have a workable solution
evidently
i've seen this video
this is fantastic
ya tool
ya dick
Wonder why im not saying anything?
I know.
yeah
he'd do it but it'd be costly
though
he would give it too
im not going to
holy shit
that's not me
at least in my opinion 
an asshole is easier to deal with than an asshole with a cause
his existence makes our lives harder so long as we’re not doing whatever rugon says to do
i should add
i hadn’t thought of arguments for the matter tbh
his existence makes our lives harder
that too
yeah
plus i want to see the new pc
yeah
and three he’s made multiple threats to our lives and whether or not they were in jest, we’re probably better of without him
at least if i was to play to character 
two Roman doesn’t like him and would not pitch in
one, its a big fucking hassle that we don’t have the money for
*points
i have three pointd
idk
i still want my mystery reward from the mafia
in the game i want downtime. then we kill krihili
well then no
unless you want to keep playing lynn
my vote is no
oh do next?
is this about reviving lynn?
okay
What guy?
I mean do whatever you gotta do to enjoy a game with milo as party face
fuck
necessarily a good formula for success
and I don’t think thats
cause otherwise we’ll probably just end up doing whatever milo or I suggest 
some opinions and motivation to the table
i hope you do bring like
cool
so a clinically depressed bard?
he’s cool
yeah
oh you’re the white guy from pyre
so i honestly don’t know how it translates to dnd
so i honestly don’t know how it translates to dnd
fantasy basketball 
pyre is like
PYRE
cause I have no clue what anyone is playing
I was going to ask what you were playing for eric’s game
Yep
gives less than 2 hours 
mhm
so i wont be in that oneshot pretty sure
which i think is still a problem with kev’s group 
until 8:45
yes
Not scheduled tomorrow apparently 
yea
knowing the players, that could be a problem but idk. The city he’s made is detailed. Looks like a lot of quality content potentially
i think this could be a pretty good one. From what Eric’s said so far he wants it to be very open ended
understandable 
that sounds like a pain in the ass
yeah, no worries. I won’t bother you about it cause 
i can’t really call
ah, i see
did you have an injury or like an doctor’s appointment ?
uh
wtf have you been doing so you can’t feel your hands?
i just wanted to talk dnd cause i spent the past 4 hours reworking my background to fit his city
nah fuck it
fair enough 
have you read all his rules and shit?
what are your thoughts on eric’s campaign so far
excellent 
oi parsa
if i don’t find anything by then then im going home and trying later
i’ll be done in an hour
am
rn im shopping for fuckin birthday presents for my stepmom
tuesday
ah yeah starting the 20th
what do you mean lunch?
?
but im not at home either
no
so i guess that's cool
they're slightly less broken now
nope
i did too
yeah
i need to call the portents before a roll is made
my bad
but i'll use them properly from here on out
also i was misusing my portents
early podcast episodes
but idk it's not the same without video
i may go back and listen to those
which means i kinda skipped a lot
and also not the podcast episodes
not cteam
much better than critical role
it's
only the episodes that were streamed and filmed but
i've been watching it
that you decided to do an acq inc flavored campaign
i'm very glad
that was not the int check to roll a nat 1 on
fuck man
60%
and that's it?
that was a high class touchup
very nice
was that yours?
horribly disfigured jim darkmagic
the addition of the
very on brand
good session
i mean i’ll be there at 9:20
and by nearly
nearly
that's why you change characters so much
5?
what fuckin level are you looking toward?
yep
than 2 dex
2 feats that give me dex
i'd rather take
i believe in the dice
i can deal with 19 dex
i can deal with 19 dex
whatever
big gay
i had thought milo said we were doing eric style asis
and i was 18
it gives you +1 to str or dex
weapon mastery does give you stat upgrades
milo said we were at least
we were
no
yeah
now it is
at least
20
im a "get in that meat" rogue
well yeah but you're also a crossbow rogue
five is bigger than 2
for more damage on my little shiv
im taking twf
all of those boys get multiattack
yeah
well was it figthing styles as a fighter?
so it's +2 damage for one weapon, or +5 amage overall
is with two weapons
the only way we can make multiple attacks
but rogues don't get that
if i had multiattack
which would be great
dueling is a +2 bonus to damage
right?
you say take dueling
i think it may be worth
generally
fights with two weapons
as someone who
do i take archery or two weapon fighting?
for fighting style
im gonna take the weapon master feat for missy
oi
good fucking luck\
make them feel pain
it's just i see people liking anime and i want to m
with a debate on a japanese show for kids
parsa im sorry for blowing up your computer on discord
ok
cool
i love kruber
that isn't just the picture of your mech
a specific picture
but if you want a picture on your token
i do not care
and slap that shit on discord
and can either export to clipboard or to a file
you go to pilot roster
your mom is called heavy gunner
brighteyes is just a warlock disguised as a wizard
cause this would literally be like my fourth warlock in a row
but don’t wanna look like a fiend
its that i also just wanna play warlocks
its not like i don’t want to play this fighter
i know
that is a pally/hexblade
? ive got a backup
fighter
then im going hex-pally glaivelock
maybe like a 5 or 6 session break from warlock 
i need a break
no
i really just wanna play a warlock
i don’t expect this character to live long
massive forehead and jew fro
tiny eyes
out of proportion chin
exactly like that
i imagine him looking
and i don’t like tracing all that much
but i’ll just be drawing the knight
i might 
wow fuck you
i can if you want me to
no
hexblade pally sounds pretty good though 
count me the fuck in
and i get to play a warlock?
that’d be fun
and just minmax the shit out of our characters and kill everything 
i think we gotta go in with the expectation of it being campy and memey
he’s been saying he would for a few weeks
then i’ll wait for that
when is it at?
i didn’t say i would
yes
and my mondays and tuesdays are as well
sundays are same as ever
no
I FIXED MY FLAWS FOR YOU
gimme 5 mins
whats the deal my guy? how’re you hanging 
there's something wrong with me
not very cash money there
yeah
as long as it’s not nothing 
tbh i don’t care what we do
yep
nah i’d just be bullshitting
oh
crowd control?
cc?
which is really the most important part 
i know how to roll dice in that game
but we don’t have to
i suggested we play some vtm
something 
absolutely 
agreed
whats the plan for tonight? with Alix gone
i said from the get go it wasn’t a good day for me
i can’t be predictable on sundays
well, as free as usual 
my sunday is free
on saturday 
i sent that to eric’s game
?
i didn’t mean for kevin’s game
so what’s the word on this sunday?
it's a good one
i do like your tzeentch by the way
wow now that i've said that 3 times i feel like a massive fuckboy
ready when you are
im actually back early
okay
fine
lul
if i get spells
which means its up to you
yeah
i gotta find spells
that's fuckin wild
also just realized that i don't get new spells when i level up
sick i don't have to choose yet
so yeah it's 6
i just saw that
oh no
right
a day
i can only prep 3
im just fucking with you
i know it is
let me know if i need to do more
and all that extra shit is in there
spells are picked
alright, character is done
it'll probably be easier to read it on roll20
Darkness and cold iron. The boy shivers, wrapped in a frail, rough-spun blanket. The soft voice of a young woman, singing quietly, the names of components, compounds, mixtures, and methods. A pair of pale hands, reach through the bars and stroke the back of his neck. They're warm and they help ease the boy to sleep. 

The boy's oldest and fondest memories are of Dott. Her warm hands, her golden hair, milky eyes, soft whispering voice after the other sisters had gone to bed and Auntie Mottom had retired to her shrine for the night. She would wake him in the middle of the night and walk him around the glade, to watch the pigs sleep, and hear the leaves speak, and read the stars above. They'd walk through the gardens and she'd teach him the names and uses of all the herbs and flowers, the powders they'd make and what spells they would create. She'd teach him letters and numbers, languages, and her art of reading the future.

Dott told him once that she'd never wanted him to live in that cage. She didn't visit him during the day, for if she did, the sisters would hurt the boy more, just to spite her. Though the nights belonged to the boy and Dott alone, the days belonged to the Sisters and to Auntie Mottom. Each day, one of the Sisters, Faba, Moira, and Iris, took a turn toying with the Boy. They were relentless, and at times needed Mottom to reel them in.

Faba, the eldest, who had a face like a sow liked to transmute the boy's food. She made his grain taste like dung and dung taste like the sweet honey. She'd make him chase the water from his bowl around his cage if he wanted a sip, then she'd let it splatter on the floor of the cage and he'd have to lap it all up before she heated the metal enough that it sizzled away into nothingness.

Moira was an enchantress, who practiced her charms on the boy daily, until she was the most beautiful creature the boy had ever laid eyes upon. When she entered his coop, he would press his face to the bars and beg for her touch. "Please Mistress Moira, bless me with the barest touch of your little finger," he would say. To which she would respond, "Maybe, but first you must wash these clothes and dry these sheets and sew this patch onto Faba's disgusting blouse. Then you'll sew these seeds and milk that cow and pick these berries and mind those nettles and shovel that shit, and wash those troughs and pull those weeds and scrub those basins and fold these blankets and feather that chicken. Then, if you wash that dirty face of yours I'll be so pleased that I'll pinch your ugly cheek." And the boy would do it, because one never disobeys Moira.

Iris, the youngest sister, was mostly unconcerned with the boy unless she had a new concoction she needed tested. Potions, poisions, pastes, tinctures, it didn't matter which, she made him taste them or she made him taste her whip, both equally satisfying. Often, she'd leave the boy choking, seizing upon the floor of the cage, and Mottom would have to force Iris to remember to give the boy the antidotes to her poisons. Those same nights, Iris's yelps would ring out from within Auntie Mottom's shrine, and Dott would shower the boy with attention. Of course, Iris never learned. Dott suspected Iris enjoyed those nights with Mottom almost as much as she enjoyed forgetting her antidotes.

Auntie Mottom was head of their small circle. She left the boy alone, for the most part. She was more concerned with her studies and her rituals. Once a year, she would come down to the boy's cage and draw a bit of his blood. She tested it for potency, used it in her spell weaving, cultured it, to see when the boy might be ready for her purposes. Dott both feared and revered Mottom, for Mottom was old and she knew dark secrets that she kept locked in her shrine. But Mottom had brought the girls in under her wing. They had all made mistakes with their magics, and were in dire need of food and shelter, which Mottom provided, safety, which Mottom ensured, and the freedom to experiment as much as they liked, which Mottom encouraged. The boy was never sure what to think of Mottom, and that hasn't ever changed.

One night, when the boy was eight, after Iris had fed him a particularly brutal poison that had burned his throat raw. Dott was brewing tea for the boy, when he had his first portent. He saw darkness, a horrible storm with howling winds, lightning flashing across the sky. He saw lightning strike the great oak atop the lone hill and shatter its old wood. Dott took the vision to Mottom, who began preparations for the storm immediately. When the came to pass, and they found the oak tree shattered the next morning. Mottom decided upon a new use for the boy. One that didn't involve him sleeping in a cage and being Moira's pet. That day, the circle brought the boy out from his cage, and began training the boy in magics, and that night, Dott gave him his name. Amias.

With Dott now in charge of Amias' training, he began to study in earnest the techniques of divining the future from signs and tools, ways of controlling his portents to glimpse into the future and see what others only wish they could see. The circle took to calling him Brighteyes, for his eyes shone like burnished gold whenever he practiced his craft. Yet, with his new position came newfound resentment, and though Faba might let him be and instead, take out her cruel impulses on the pigs, the other sisters were slow to let go.

Lessons with Moira graduated from menial chores to personal tortures. Amias was her footstool, her bench, her manservant, and her toe-licker, and she rewarded him with kisses. Iris would test Amias by slipping poisons into his food and having him find the right antidotes without going into shock. "Learning from experience," they called it. "Brighteyes has to make up for lost time, most mages start much younger!"  Mottom would bob her wiry head and left them to their own devices.

The years passed slowly in those times, with the freedom to walk the circle's grounds, Amias found a sort of happiness. Sunlight on his hair, unfiltered by thatched rooftops, wind on his face, warm earth beneath his feet, and Dott as his guide, his days were peaceful, eventually, even the Sisters got bored of using him as their plaything once Mottom had performed her midsummer ritual and Moira's daughter was born healthy the next spring. Things were peaceful, even. And then Amias received a vision.

Darkness floods the glade of his home like a rain cloud blocking the sun.There's a low rumbling, that grows to a thundering roar as cracks split the earth, swallowing the houses and stables whole. He ses the basket cradle for Moira's daughter slip off a bench and disappeared into the void below. There are screams, unrecognizable, descending into the earth, and calls for help rising up from within. From the lone hill with the charred oak tree, he hears a cry in a voice he recognizes. Dott. Mother. He dashes for the hill, but the cracks are quicker. They reach out in terrible splinters, and the hill, in its entirety, caves in and  crumbles into nothing. Then he slips, and the void consumes him too.

Upon awakening, Amias immediately told Dott, who told everyone. Mottom, old and wise, simply sighed, and did her best to assuage their fears, telling them, "These sorts of visions come to oracles from time to time, and rarely do they happen exactly as foretold. No, the Earth is not going to crack open and swallow everything, and it definitely won't happen tomorrow. Don't be ridiculous. Now, I have rituals to prepare, don't bother me again today." This set Dott at ease, and the two went about their day as usual, but Amias still had a nagging feeling in the back of his head and a small spring of panic that refused to leave his gut. 

Three days later, it arrived in the form of a large force of armed men in dark leathers and polished armor. They were carrying parchments from the city of Byss, ordering them to cease any and all unsanctioned magical activity. Dott and Amias were told to go wait inside with Moira and her baby. They didn't see what happened, but they heard the shouting, then the screams of pain, then they felt the fires licking at their heels. Dott and Amias tried to gather all their belongings into packs, while Moira prepared her daughter. The fire spread to the roof, and the beams above their heads creaked and crumbled, collapsing down between them, Dott and Amias on one half of the house, with Moira and her daughter on the other. Moira didn't even spare them a glance before escaping. Amias made to leave as well, but felt a hot hand grip his ankle. Amias looked down.

Dott's leg had been caught under a fallen beam. He saw the mottled skin where the fire licked at it. The blood and bone where it had been crushed by the heavy wood. The palms of Dott's hands were red and swollen. He couldn't hear the words she spoke, couldn't feel the heat on his face and his arms and hands, couldn't taste the smoke in his mouth. All he could do was watch, numbly, as the fire crept up the fabric of her skirt and blouse, singed her thighs and her pale stomach. He watched her mouth form simple words, "Run. Live," and it took a moment to register the meanings of those words. Then another beam fell and splattered her face into the wooden floor. Amias fell, then scrambled toward escape, throwing himself out the door. The sky above was filled with black smoke. The glade, the garden, the pig pen, the chicken coop, even the surrounding forest, was all alive with flame in lashing tongues and arms and spouts that consumed everything. Amias grabbed his smoldering pack and ran into the woods.

He can't remember the days he spent running from those fires, he ate whatever herbs he could find, drank whatever water he managed to run into, got sick, crawled into a cave and vomited until he could run again. Those days were filled with the memories of burning flesh, the smell of smoldering hair. Blood and shards of bone and charred skin. He didn't stop until he found himself at a crossroad, with a sign that said he was half a mile away from Byss. Byss, where those men who started those fires that destroyed his life were from. Byss, where he could enact his revenge. Amias arrived mid-afternoon, and by evening, he managed to find a place that would rent a room to someone that smelled as terrible as he did. Yet when he closed his eyes to sleep, he found a familiar vision waiting for him.

It isn't over. In fact, this end has only begun.
im gonna go get some breakfast now.
i finished
well
and are for people who don't want to play the whole game
cause focuses are gay
also swapping from a focus to a component pouch
once i pick spells
i will
i didn't
kevin had yesterday
we're FINE
but game hasn't started yet
ya boi fucked up
listen
man
listen
listen man
there
whoops
wait really
what
background gives me 2
variant human gives me 1
wizard gives me 4
because
i'm busy writing fucking sixteen paragraphs of backstory
i'll pick spells in a bit
i'm gonna change that shit in a sec
Amias is the name Dott calls him
LMAO
so dont read it, fucker
it's not done
when i post this long ass fucking backstory
you'll get them anyway
sure
i named them all
all of em?
okay
second one's probably the best
not even sure i like em
fuck these tokens
also
his name is Amias
but i tried to fuck with it
and i think the one i was gonna go with was Nieman
I went through a lot of name generators
Amias
alright we'll make it simpler
i feel like i wrote that wrong
ew
Niam Brighteyes for the dude, only used by wizard mom who went by Dott
name of the divination mage
name and token
riiiiight now
im writing the shit right now
it'll be done today
i thought it was some petty shit like “no you won’t be back first”
oh
fuck you
i’ll be back first
okay
or a call to use this backstory for something else?
is this a call to make a new backstory?
i’ll be back in like 20 mins
fml i forgot headphones 
oh
im on phone
yes why
eyes started shining and he started muttering incoherently about storms and lightning splitting an oak they use for rituals and it happened 
but while one of the witches was  harassing him he manifested his powers of divination
was being kept chained up so that on his 13th birthday they could use him to propagate their lineage then sacrifice him for some wonderfully nasty rituals
im getting there
raised by a small coven of five witches
or Brighteye
just Boy
character has no name
the idea is finished 
instead i’ll give you a synopsis 
i won’t brb
i've actually gotta take off for a sec, i'll brb
okay
3 assholes wander into a bar and go dungeon raiding 
so whats the premise
you’re not gonna like it
super gay
i’ll write the backstory 
ok
hell no
the die roles are the important part 
sounds good
can i take this background?
ok
or just me?
all of us?
hell yeah suck my dick
alright
ok
okay i’ll do it now then
alright, i’ll figure out a sad backstory 
fair enough
if it’s high magic that wouldn’t make much sense though
if i go wizard i could do some witch hunt shit
is this thing you’re running high or low magic 
thats workable
oh okay
like dead babies sad?
how sad?
what do you want out of a backstory?
or we try to play on a friday and see what happens 
i’ll give it a week or two off
it did
but im not for sure on that
im guessing next wednesday 
no
this coming wednesday 
but wed is apparently unavailable for someone as well
i think wednesday 
ryan can’t make sunday cause the schedule change 
also, i got it from the source that this week’s a no-go
on the other hand i will be trying to write a vtm plot now that i know you wanna play one
so you guys can do what you want with less competition 
that came off wrong
im not gonna make plans for a while so you guys can do whatever 
if you’ve got a plan though bring it up in chat
that apolonario killed platt
you could probably get apane to convince him to go with it
except for the fact that he drank some of that wine
but you could probably convince him that it really was apolonario
Roman would think it’s a terrible fucking plan
don’t tell roman
i like it
okay, seriously, i see you check the group chat periodically. how can you stand the auto response spam?
but i haven't
you've probably seen this one
but a mans can dream right?
yeah
if not, even better
i figure either milo or eric is gonna drag me back before the end of the day with something like "you can't leave" and that'll be that
and that alone gives me a fuckin headache
i do, but every time something gets posted it gets pushed to the top of my recent chats and i see it anyway
i need a fuckin break from looking at shitty lyrics
lmao
it'd mean you get to be friends with apane though
l m a o
oh are you gonna tie him to the ascendant order?
your anti-mage?
i'll need nothing more
straight sword, six hand spans long, the proper length
Nah
rapier gay
kensei does, though
and long death doesn't give me a gooder sword
but i wanna use a sword
long death one
yeah
To truly understand the Art of Cutting, one must soak themselves in death. They must know death with their hands, death with their feet, knees, elbows and forehead. They shall kill with the very breath that invigorates them! And then they'll find that they'll no longer have use for a sword, for it is an ugly instrument and its adherents idiots.
very normal
who's obsessed with killing
im just gonna play a normal kensei monk
and i can’t come up with a motivation for something like that
cause i like my shit simple
btw
thats a joke
and he’ll travel the land in order to slay all the samurai and master the blade in order to better serve his master
but everyone will call him shinobi or wolf
his name will be sekibo
alright, i think i’ve ironed out my backup character 
thats good
christ
wow spelling, kms
lookingnit up
i haven’t seen the blade runner one
but its kind of missing the ricardo part of a ricardo meme
that one is solid
where?
what
you saw it yesterday so it’s already a repost
well in the name of fair trade I’ll trade you the best meme that I currently have on my phone
jfc
put this everywhere 
THIS IS FIRE
oh, in addition, we only become a loose end if we do this job then start saying shit like, “Alright, we’re leaving then! Hopefully we never work with you again! Fuck you, Apolonario!”
nah, it’s our in with the magia
the talk with apolonario
not even the elianora part
yep
you have no idea how long ive been waiting for last session 
i’ll be honest 
arright 
although, that kind of involves apolonario being alive and happy
alright Roman’s down to do this your way so long as it doesn’t fuck him over
which is why i like lynn the most
but we don’t 
you have a choice 
i think
im not sure we have much of a choice at this point
yep
apane is solid
especially now that my fuckin plan worked
imma be honest lynn is the best character in the party rn
but i wouldn't have the wars and the who controls what and all the characters
i'd use that much cause it's standard
yes that's the basic premise
cause fuck that shit it's too long
just that i wouldn't use the lore
im not saying that i wouldn't run a VtM game btw
no yeah it definitely could just be LA
bloodshit?
just have most places full of people and boom now you gotta stealth everywhere and try not to eat anyone or rip people in half
to design interesting gameplay
makes it pretty easy
well yeah
it's too much shit to go through and keep track of
i don't think i could feasibly run a game of VtM in the established universe
that'll definitely make it more complicated than 5e
oh yeah
*he's
probably
he apparently a professional monster actor in movies and shit
alex ward
yeah
they have a campaign stream, LA by night
yeah
geek and sundry
not critical role
it seemed less complicated when i watched the critical role guys play it
or at least
it's all d6s
it seemed less complicated to me
the rules of vtm?
but i just wanna play a nosferatu gutter rat
vtm looks sick as fuck
dude i've been talking about VtM in kevin's group chat for like 2 months
ah i see
cause fuck, that movie looks like it'll be crazy
now that i think about it, my favorite part of going to that movie was seeing the trailer for Midsommar
cause if you have we can talk about it if not i won't tho
so you've seen us though?
that said making a joker movie is a great idea
im just not gonna get my hopes up
yea
its bad cause dc can’t write 
actually you can tell
can never tell about the story 
idk, dc tends to focus on flashy cool shots and imagery
looks ok
no
also is dc making it?
idk
not heath ledger 
not sure if i recommend watching it in theaters and spending money on it
and it was okay 
i saw us today
there was a cat guy just smashing the fucking sienfeld theme across the station
nah the clown was dead
and i have no idea what the fuck is going on
i tried just observing a game
space station 13 is crazy
are you kidding?
AN ELF???
this is very gay
.
the fuck
depending 
*mins
that could be like 5-15 mina
oh
how close is close?
sick
oh
i’ll bring all the shit i need to work on the oneshot
actually
anything i should bring?
sounds good
Just hit me
yeah 1 is good
but im not 100 %on 1
345 S Alexandria av
soonish probably by 1
no worries about that though
smashing that sekiro
miles is fuckin
i c
at least on the record
don't even drive that one
and i
i hadn't driven in a year before i got the motorcycle
yeah no need
it's true
never
when has milo ever driven anything?
no
i suppose i guess i just
but i suppose i guess i just assumed people were as retarded as uti and milo
i've never asked
you have your license btw?
sure
and then i'll be free
so she'll drop me off sometime before noon
i'll just be with my mom in the morning
i don't work on thursday
they just aren't old brad pitt
not that his action flicks aren't good
when he was in good movies
this was before brad pitt started his save the world phase
im retarded, thought it was in theaters
it's on netflix
oh
don't know what time
uh
yeah lets do it
oh alright
cause that's most brad pitt movies
is it a brad pitt saves the world movie?
nope
haven't seen seven
yeah netflix and chill brotherrr esketit
yeah i've seen the usual suspects
i don't understand it
oh
that i'd also like
is a movie that i think you'd like
no country for old men
ive been debating seeing us because jordan peele isn't fucked up enough to be scary
favorite genre, even
best genre
but i like horror
that's an odd sentence but the point gets across
im getting really tired of fucking marvel movies
i don’t know if anything is out that is good
sure
and yeah, or friday/saturday 
why the did?
im just walking them rn, shouldn’t be much longer 
forgot about it until last minute 
i needed to stop at the store and grab wet food so my dog would eat
for sure 
no
you could take it a step forward and then arbitrarily decide that one of the players will always be a traitor 
gives the players a straightforward role right from the outset
randomly 
yeah players will take premade roles
oh
so each character has events scripted for them, but some of them won’t happen in different playthroughs
and have players roll to see which they are in the beginning of the game
come up with say 20 named characters in the castle total
you should 
to add a bit of randomness to it, and make it more fun to dm
for the oneshot
i did have an idea though 
sorry im gonna get food first
but im starving 
okay im off work
so probably around 8:30-9
when i get home
good point
which sucks
i know
it'd be a lot of work
and your pcs are my npcs
and my pcs are your npcs
in different calls
we could run 2 sessions of this 1shot at the same time
to make this even better
I just thought of a way
SHIT
OH
i am so fucking down
absolutely
it looks too fun
i don't give a fuck
shit
i kind of have to play this game now
fuck this video is hilarious
yeah
that's the most important part
each pc has to randomly be given a role
not unless they're an assassin trying to murder the lord of the castle
this is fucking great
you could run this multiple times and it'd always be different
just to make it as balls to the wall as possible
every living npc and every pc takes an action
how about
l m a o
oh
they won't see it coming
true true
so everyone is locked in
it should be a castle, but there's a zombie apocalypse going on outside
it should be a castle
like people playing pranks?
is it just random ass shit
you get 4-5 players and it can be different every time
so like hmm
do you want to set up this game in dnd?
yes.
so good
this is fucking
oh my god
this is an incredible video
"you can't consent to being a pizza"
holy FUCKING shit
tomorrow night
you're here all week, right?
cause he asked
except tomorrow i was gonna go to kbbq with jett and his friends 
hell yeah
its good shit
not because of those fat crits, but cause he’s a weirdo stalker murderer. and he doesn’t try to hide it.
i like your new character 
my guy
now the game is at the top of my priority list\
you should have said that from the start
i didn't know divinity 2 had a gm mode
at least i had assumed they were zombies
so just a stock zombie with a stock shortsword
it woulda been a zombie
well
lmao fair
that was what you last described my pc doing
since
i thought you were gonna use my pc in it
in the zombie fight
ah
oh shit
did you put my fucking guy in here?
wait
UNFORTUNATE
but how about this
not sure how far you've gotten
acutally
16
but 17
not quite 12 minutes
okay i'm back
im also gonna recommend scrolling down through the compendium until you hit the ISP-N mechs cause i think those shits might just be your style
well fuck
oh
assuming you use chrome
and clicking the one labeled drive
and clicking on the boxes
by opening up a new tab
which you can reach
it should be in shared with me on your google drive
no
gear tags might be useful at page 125
the compendium starts at 118
which is all on page 46
like core bonus and talents
but there will be a lot of info that you don't gotta read in there
and then maybe 42-48 for the  mechs
for pilot gen
i recommend skimming it all but the most important pages are 29, 30, 31, 37
you won't even really use much of, since you'll only be using the things from the top section of the compendium
which
i am, but the only parts you might need are the pc gen rules, the mech gen rules, which come right after the pc gen rules and the compendium 
it's both the phb and the dm guide
i sent you the core rulebook over google drive
but in the meantime i’ll send you this
gonna need until 8:30
if you want 
ye
maybe
im off work so
ik feels bad
plus its a oneshot who cares about treasure
they won’t live through that
fuck
devolver digital is the best
still reading this 500 page fucking handbook
im
cool
and 5 damage is a lot
ap is armor piercing
Smith-Shimano EX Slipstream Module The EX SLIPSTREAM program is a Smith-Shimano innovation open only to highly licensed pilots. An interesting development in personal travel, the EX SLIPSTREAM module itself is a miniaturized near-lightspeed star drive capable of transporting the user through blinkspace with acceptable accuracy. The program and its technology is temperamental; a mech core is the smallest unit capable of surviving the stress of exposed blink travel, though the experience is still traumatic to the user and those in close proximity to egress.                                                                                                                                                             Passive:This dangerous and experimental module is a miniaturized starship nearlight drive. You can use it as a full action. When you use it, roll 3d6. You can teleport to a point within that range around you as long as there is space for your mech. You don’t have to be able to see this point, but if you attempt to teleport to an already occupied space (by terrain, another mech, etc), the teleport fails and you take 5 AP kinetic damage.If you roll triples for this system, your mech disappears and does not re-appear, either indefinitely or until your party rests (up to you).

one of those frames is this
so the dude abbadon's system called lancer has modular mechs that you sorta build out of frames and those frames core abilities that come with them.
good job
that game is fucking hard
that's true
and bigger iphones
and gender studies degrees
antifa
what do we have instead?
we were supposed to have flying cars.
doesn't feel like 13 years
wow
jesus fucking christ
diamond was 13 years ago?
wow
i don't remember ever playing through a full pokemon tbh
always
animatics make everything better
it's better
that's chainlock
uh pokemon, but with a bit more bdsm
but then it's like
maybe
oh cool
but now whenever i see that face i'm gonna hear this voice
im not gonna play this game
but pact of the chain doesn't have much to do with chains.
i mean chainlock sounds fuckin metal
isn't all that inaccurate
which
idk man petlock sounds like evil petco
or having a cool pet
or pallylock
or eldritch machinegun
like glaivelock
but warlocks are shitty from the get go, so you can do whatever you want and it's cool, cause it's not eldritch blast. 
and generally you just end up being kinda shitty. especially in comparison to what you could have been had you just built normally.
it actually takes a bit of effort to put a spin on any of the other classes
like
yes that was the reference i was making
but you can do it in 31 flavors
you only do one thing
and it's why warlocks are my favorite class
pretty great
thats
i need my goddamn book too
i need my goddamn book too
yeah fuck
i want my goddamn book
and it's about time to... not be that anymore.
i think we can agree that being level 2 sucks
lmao
regardless.
okay well
well it'll be fine
*4 whoops
won't get eldritch blast until level 5
i do fine when people ignore me
we just got bullshit luck on our side
yeah we would have gotten destroyed
and also if fuckin apane didn't level up after that fucking highlight reel chaos bolt, than i guess it's fair enough
wasn't much of a milestone
he does that too
he's getting there
well
debauchery is an artform and roman has perfected it
we don't care
yeah but
LOL
apparently
terror is
i guess plan "join the magia" is still in effect.
never fuckin mind then
honestly if you've got the hookup with rugon then we can probably use him to pressure the magia a bit
this'll be cool
well
took a note of that
from chanus
he's the fucking council member that the other council members are scared of
he's the only one that doesn't have the backing of a well situated family in Gradbold
yeah
oh yeah deeeefinitely
fucking Rugon.
it seems kevin has a thing for getting us entangled with people who reek of BAD NEWS
yeah
no i just dont want to get in the way while you're saying it
shit
oh
im still not sure if i should drop armor of shadows for the ritual casting one at level 3 too
not yet
from the extension kevin added
*cantrips
and agonizing cantrips
armor of shadows is one
nope
until my next cantrip
i'll pick up firebolt next level and that'll be my thing
but i didn't
sure
i mean if i took any ranged spell attacks i'd be hitting with a +7
oh right fighting style is a bitch
at level 2?
a fucking laser turret
he's like
holy shit
fuckin rip man
i mean violent murder is instinctual
what's his cha again?
true
too dumb to use his dick?
you're telling me that the new guy is
so
I am sure
roman's prudish
specific taste in guys, broad taste in girls
not saying no.
untill he's drunk
dude roman's got specific taste in guys
he's barely aldente
a noodle
apane is like
im playing to character
and the character is horny not me
that and action
i just want to bone eleonora platt.
me too tbh
sometimes party swings the wrong way
and i'm still pretty salty about that
right?
this just makes me more upset that we didn't leave the city to chase after them, you know that?
yeah....
yes.
yeah?
fuck that's his name
oh?
there's not much math involved
it's only d20s and d6s
it's called lancer
im stupid
yep
lemme see
well
battletech
it looks like it's all set on earth?
but 40k has a scope that this seems to be lacking
it has a similar look and feel
i can see why you'd like em
the steiners have the gauntleted fist crest?
OH
yeah
lets see
i didnt see anything on the steiners
yeah
oh
there's a discord and a few canon campaigns
so there isn't like a shitton of lore
but the system only got made like in 2017
just scanned the wiki
the universe is pretty different too though
which will definitely keep it from being wonky
the gameplay itself is pretty simple
in mechs
in that you do battle
but it's sorta like battlemech
something made up
at max level will all be maxed out
it looks like there are 4 groups of skills that
this is weird
hmmm
rip
so
it's over 550 pages
and
the same guy who i stole all my god shit for both of my campaign ideas from
i finally caved and downloaded the rulebook for a tabletop mech game made by this guy Abbadon, who writes and draws the most hardcore comic ever made.
we’ll just have to see
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmnah
fair enough
you woulda had a much easier time dying
im surprised you didn't want to leave the town with me
i guess
good times
new character
he's potentially the best gm
he's a very good gm
i think there are only 2 episodes up rn
streams it on twitch
he just started
i still think this is the best dnd video ever made
and he'll have some super interesting shit to say about it
look for titles that seem disinteresting
you can just
this is the playlist
this guy is the shit
okay
*setting, not session 
kevin showed that shit to me, made me start writing a session like 2 videos in
have you heard of running the game?
oh
and then i’ll still have to watch matt colville’s campaign 
i’ll watch them after
i have a headache after that shit
just gonna waste the rest of my night watching critical role
lets do this right
okay
just opening the app
origin broke it
what the absolute fuck is happening to my computer
wtf
his fucking lag
should be all clear
yeah
oh gross they have to smell his skin spores
does his power work through speaker systems?
i don’t watch the netflix shows
thats okay
i feel like marvel wouldn’t take that to the extremes though 
dank power
but i should 
i don’t know him
at least, im assuming 
but yeah killing the wraith was much more interesting to his cousin than the crown itself
as far as not seeing the monster hunter thing, a, roman isn’t very in tune with the rest of his family 
i was gonna buy a watch had i gotten the chance, so thank you
It’s pretty much the most useful thing you could have given me
like belmonts
monster hunters
yeh
thanks
i didn’t write it down cause i’m a massive retard
hey, do you remember what the name of that inn damian was staying at is?
im on my way back
understandable 
ah
then leaving them unsaid
beginning to type things
i see a man
?
the chances that i’ll get some angry peasant to be my attack dog against any issues i come across on my turf is pretty high
and if i say, come to my aid whenever you see I need it, and I do it to say, 25 people around the area i live
it works for a month
i can’t play good characters it physically hurts
ohh yes
for some unspecified reason
and getting a bunch of 30-50 year old men as peasant thralls
or maybe just casting suggestion on them in their sleep to make them follow me anywhere
or illusioning their face clean off and watching them freak out in the morning
yeah
killin’s unbefittin of a ladie such as meself
no killing
nono
but she’ll be a thief wizard who kinda gets thrills outta breaking into men’s homes and experimenting on them in their sleep
i’ll try to see if we can get most of them having credence in different places
and switches all the time
she just has a bunch
she doesn’t make them up anymore 
Except 
yeah
yikes
worms in his head
oh so he doesn’t pick up on
so he just responds to it?
he’s not sure what his name is but everyone calls him one thing
like
okay
oh SHIT
oh shit
good
do you?
no
really
just balls to the wall paronoid
so far i have 12 names
and be a fucking psychopath who changes her name every session
im gonna go 17 wizard 3 rogue
probably for kevin’s game.
im fuckin making a second pc already
god dammit i think i caught your habit
if at all
i don't think you're gonna die until the finale of this dungeon
fair enough
yeah
 but
lmao
wait what?
same
so we'll pretend that i had said goodbye
i don't remember what i was going to say
yes i am retarded
so
i don't remember that
bye
i said
oh
i said
i did?
yeah definitely 
assuming eric or kevin work it out with you
it could work out
you could start getting specialized bolts for extra damage too
in general 
thats rogues though
thatd be nice for you
yeah
hence the fighter dip?
very clean
lmao
nah they existed
and maybe sacrificing multiple shots per round for extra damage and range
like a 6 foot tall bow
but i like the idea of using a greatbow
i don’t know how it’d work
good shit
agreed
yeah
an enchanted heavy crossbow might be difficult 
that said, coming across like
nah heavy crossbow is cooler
that’d probably work in either campaign 
but you get sneak attack
its the crossbow character 
oh
strong martial combo
thats strong
vastly different 
like
it’ll turn out different in either campaign 
and whats the idea
in which campaign?
i was just expanding on the admittedly shitty joke
you eat 6 crackers a day maximum 
a box of crackers and a gallon of gas station water
between that and 15 yeh
i am overselling it
i’ll just go without food or water for a few weeks
its fine i think
yeah
a hefty portion of my brain thinks its completely worth though 
yea im thinking about it
get my dog to stfu
lemme
ok
only without like the time constraint
but it does help to do them cause they provide some ideas of the types of strategy you might use in game
they get pretty hard later on
there's more tutorial in the puzzles section
yeah that happens
the specialists make the game playable beyond the first match, and the in game chat means that half the game is attempting to get the other players to do what you want
also once a day every player gets to hire or upgrade specialists that do a range of things like increase your line of sight, or add huge shields to all your bases, or do a bit of extra troop damage, or make all your submarines (cause it’s got a nautical theme) faster, or violently explode and destroy everything in a small area as soon as it enters combat
that allows you to look up to 48 hours ahead to make plans and see how fights will end up
but you’re given like a watch thing
there isn’t nearly as much resource management
and then you have to make alliances and shit in order to take places from other people
you start with 5 places and the map is full of neutral places that you fight over
the map is full of factories that produce troops automatically and generators that increase the amount of troops you can have, then you have to take over, and eventually build mines for this shit called neptunium, and the game ends once someone mines 200
you get a randomly generated map with 6-10 players on it
didn’t notice that one
thats a fucking huge tell
you don’t have to try it out, but if  you spend a lot of time between classes or on breaks feelin kinda bored, here’s a thing
it’s sort of like a very simplified version of civ that is played in real time, but games take place over the course of like up to 8 or 9 days
with a built in lie detector like your own, you’d probably like this phone game called subterfuge
i was just thinking
oh, parsa 
i’ll offer your soul to my devil
angels are for the gays
which is why i like the strongholds
its very true
lol
and you can use your book to ask one question of recently deceased dudes 
the familiar is super good
but fiend gives you fireball and makes you tankier
raven queen gives you a free finger of death so yeah its great for blastlock
grants temp hp
fiend
so i guess i just cc people and kill steal you guys
i get big dick temp hp off kills
im going booklock for sure
but idk, aside from that most of my shit good shit will come with scoring last hits and stuff
for a warlock, at least
im gonna have a lot of extra spell slots and free spells
 im mostly looking at combos with invocations
and my spells right now mean nothing cause I only have one.
rn im just using jinx shot and some goofy cantrip that makes me run fast
later
but i could potentially have a lot of ways to force attacks of opportunity 
i don’t get enough shit for dumb combos yet
some not so much
yeah some of the spells are super cool
means we have a reason to save money 
but looks interesting for later levels
it’s long
still reading it
im hyped, but I don’t want any big expectations. But I guess you’d be justified in assuming a fair amount of heresy will be involved 
oh no
cause they were spent 
no the red tokens were the charred ones
i doubt it.
i've got a feeling that kevin's game will be a good game
will be good
this
ah
fair nough 
still have dogshit hp tho
whelp there you go
which one?
yep
we might as well just play phoenix wright
i'll talk you out of your money
if you're not you're fucked
this is true
and instead uses them to hit things real good
and 1 tanky spellcaster that doesn't use slots to cast
2 shit spellcasters
a warlock a paladin, and a sorcerer
yeah
big boy ac
yeah
i guess
for advantage?
we can enhance ability that if need be
that's definitely true
yeah  but plate armor
are pretty much good
you
you don't have a -2 in anything.
i suppose, yeah
did you just want a bigger mental?
oof
oof?
which was the last roll
didn't get anything objectively bad until the 7
and then just
*18 i mean
i rolled a 20 first roll
7,14,16,11,14,20
not meh
uh
it's
i did too
mine was just a meme
oh lmao
personal storylines are better cause they're personal. which immediately gives them more emotional weight
overarching storylines in dnd just lead to railroading and stupid deus ex machina bullshit for the sake of a story that needs to be told
kys
lul
i just forgot if there were other countries on the continent
yeah
why am i asking you
wtf
wait
gradbold is the capital city on upica, right?
it'll be hard to hate my 20 cha
or maybe not
but we will hate each other
i mean we won't kill each other
this aint gon work
goddamn
or more like 55
that translates to like 60
late 20s
like
idk
named Roman Kilgore
cause im an edgelord apparently
tiefling
so you guys can't get mad at me
only not a little girl
it's gonna be the second character i was planning for eric's
another warlock
good plan
i just have this one and hansa the rerun
damn man
3 for this game?
conquest aight
what's your pc's name?
i didn't know you finished your character for kevin's campaign
oi parsa
go for it
still 10 mph can fuck you up if the tire gets over any of you
i was honestly more worried about the dog
more like 10
it wasnt' like comin at me at 40 miles per hour
yep
kill self
i was back in 8 mins but had to grab a massive ass box from my aunt’s trunk
apologies 
shouldnt be more then 10 mins
im on my way going as fast as i am able
alright 
apologies, i will make it up by not being a retard edgelord
than i had originally said
er
im gonna be late
whelp
fair enough 
what level are we at?
9:30-10?
uh
and if theres no one there he’ll talk to himself
i’ll hit you with the edgy spiky anime hair
wont have a choice
you
“life is pain” “i stay in the dark to hide the darkness in my soul”
full meme edgelord anti-hero hovering in his own dark corner of everything 
okay then
do you want me to stress test your storytelling or normal test it?
sounds good
alright
best kind of backstory 
oh, fair enough 
am at my dads rn might be late
i’ll try
tonight?
okay then
oh
but i don’t think you have a reason for that
yea
you’ve got the thing where you were apparently stalking the party for some obscure reason that nobody’s asked about 
i mean
rip
problem is that he makes pc’s integral to the plot
same tbh
instant disintegrate is retarded tbh
really gay
^
yeh
you should give him some backstory
markus is good though
yea
so they won’t be wasted
i think eric is giving shit to characters he thinks are going to stay in the party
if you want the staff, though you’re welcome to it
oh right forgot that one
and you have none
i have 2
but 2/5 have 1 thing, t’nesi has 3 things
vargach’s hammer is alright though
t’nesi and i have a small monopoly on magic shit
eh
but he can deal fire damage
cause he has jack shit
i probably should have given it to keta
but i gave the cloak to t'nesi
for the most part
eldritch machinegun out-damages it with hex
aside from the touch spell it's not the most useful thing in combat
it can also make little immovable disc stairs? as an action
from a nearly free prestidigitation/minor illusion to an 8d10 necrotic touch spell
of things
does a lot
it
oh
so basically i cannot kill etan anymore 
the end
when we did that the giant gave me a magic item
and we had to go through it and fight four dudes and take the masks they were wearing to a statue of a giant in the temple
there was an ancient jotun temple beneath the citadel
sure
cause thats how i have 90% of my shit set up
reading books online hurts my eyes unless the text is white on black
i only really read physical copies these days
if/when
just that if i do i’ll know what i have to read
this doesn’t mean that i’ve gotta read it yet
bear in mind 
so
im not
cool
*ok
oh ik
which one would i have to read if i lose?
dude idk
and whats the first one?
what books are in black library btw?
hfs
uhh
okay
sorry
are you in the tutorial area?
that's not actually a terrible thing though
uh oh
oh
i got called by uti
apologies
i'll play on pc during that time
which is max level without going into prestige levels
to level 60
no it's just pc
just finished a game of a verrrrry good game called a b s o l v e r
i can
yeah
that was a good ass video
lucky fkr
i also am at my dads without my stuff
sorta
nope
fuckin oof
oof
but then he just offed himself
oh, i guess so
so he just hard inted
oh
this was just a meme btw
sounds like you were playing a small brain character 
sounds like you were playing a small brain character 
attempted to intimidate with a poisoned glass of wine that the king didn’t know was poisoned???
also
that’s pretty sick
nice
is that online or in person?
oh shit
*atc
apparently the individual in the ACT is an actual pilot, though, so he has a fairly massive advantage over everyone else.
it’s true
the entire time 
it was serious 
this shit is hilarious
you'd get this much more than anyone else
i think
parsa
its good ye
that's the real shit
yeah man
*else
more than anything els
is what i really want to do
this
i know
yea
idk i've got people
and
jett can play seriously, but he only plays himself
or isn't a gigantic edgelord
or comandeer the party
i've yet to see eric play a pc that doesn't just fuck over the party
you, milo maybe, and
like
but i'd only tell
im probably gonna have to just make my own campaign
deh
fuckin
if that were to happen i wouldn't be surprised
keta, i'm still expecting him to drop within the next four weeks
even though tnesi is a fucking hoarder bitch who's tryna take all my goddamn items
tnesi and vargach are good pcs
also he has better pcs
with things stolen from his favorite books
eric isn't either, but he puts enough work into the maps and images and shit that he doesn't need to
milo ain't the best at creating atmosphere
and there was no mood switch between those two occurences
which wasn't serious whatsoever
but most of what lead to that was the pre-session conversation
he was feeding michael gay jokes
he said something along the lines of: ship lacks women i want that girlish butt
not get fucked by him
no he said he wanted to fuck michael's dude in the ass
he stated so
chester wasn't gay
even though all he really did was make half the party want to kill him
he added diversity to the character cast
but
definitely not
yeah
um
idk i think it was fine
i also would have made miles also have an actual character
but 
tbh i'd have problems wrangling both eric and michael
to the point where milo just couldn't continue to keep things believable
the actual problem was just the pc's being retarded
i guess
i c
with the mainland so fuckin close
i think the main problem was going to the shitty island
thats what our bard did for eric's
i'd say give a game 2 sessions before checking out, yeah
fair enough
then it's bad
so if the consequences don't match the choices
at its core
but i think dnd is mostly about choices and consequences
i guess
unless you have pcs that like that shit
bad
also
gm's who do whatever the pc's want them to do.
gm's who roll over for their pc's are bad
i think there are ways to murderhobo
probably
firebolt is much less loud
and then just go invisible and run
why not like firebolt
why fireball?
but like
that's what would happen
i mean
oof
maybe a point or two of exhaustion when we started the actual campaign
it really wouldn't
yeh
and he didn't even get his dick sucked for it. tbh im kinda salty
dar went and paid all his money so that michael could eat
but
techinally michael's punishment was that he wasn't gonna get rations for the rest of my trip
yeah that's nice
oh
i mean techincally
rly didn't need the extra mouth
idk man we were getting pretty low on rations
obviously
i'd toss the faggot off my ship
i thought it was in his backstory
you're talking about michael in game
oh
wait
and was the opposite of what we needed to round out the party
and bruuj didn't do anything
*a day before the campaign
i think half the problem was the couple of conversations before the cmapaign started
tbh if you wanna reroll
yeh
and set traps for you after you instagibbed the first dude
probably would have been drawn by the sounds of the smites
it would have been 4 pairs of 2
2
at once?
lmao
good strats
lmao
and wait for your shitter bard to heal you
and you would have had to run
he woulda put you low as fuck
no the rogue couldn't have
that could have also done that
and a twink with a shotgun
that probably could have oneshot you
i had a few character ideas
feelsbad
i never got to gank you indoors tho
understandable
that shit was dank
yep
at least in how they act
i don't think there'd be any difference
if keta and michael switched characters
now that i think about it
actually
it's a good combo
excitable and retarded
so
he's like a puppy without being cute like a puppy
nah man i like him
he reminds me of a goldfish
because he doesn't have a brain
excusable
keta is
but
keta and michael
have tried to do that
both of our rogues
doesn't pay attention to anything anyone says
i think he literally just
you described earlier
which
except you just converts matter into shit to give to party
or use its 20g worth of gold to make something
you could take that
so
that said i have a glaive that i just realized i will never use
very smart, wow
but he decided he wanted to betray the lizards instantly upon getting our mission from them, despite having 0 information about them or the situation on the island
neither side was evil
and his reasoning behind it was similarly retarded
it was fucking retarded
and you could int there
*lizardmen
we could pull a frontal assault on either the pygmies or the lizard men
true i guess
...
clearly
he is not
clearly
so you couldn't tank
yeah he got rid of all the gear
and reroll
int in combat
and fucking get michael's bitch ass in line
so now i can talk
im excited cause dar's dead
i don't wanna make a campaign that isn't made of at least 70% my own shit
but idk man
i don't know anything about the faerun setting
i don't
not as players
as a dm
modules are gay
yeah but
takes so fucking long
making combat maps
the maps are bullshit
very well
yeah i understand that
yeah
and then roll
you say something
and michael got away with too much shit
L M A O
y e a h
or maybe the last two
rn i'm probably going for the first one that i sent
yk
now it's too snakey
it's just
that one's dank
it's just the same character over and over again
there are a lot of that one
looking at that one
yeah i was...
but i wanna go more snakey than that
well yeah
yeah
the shoulder to head snake ones look weird as fuck when they're female
shoulder up snake
or like
*head up snake
cause the only cool yuan ti are bottom half snake or bottom half human top half snake
but i'm only goin for bottom half snake
well yeah
#1 is a bit more snakey than the rest
they're all bottom half snake
need help with snake icons
cause milo's retarded
but i'll ask you anyway
i was asking milo the question i was gonna ask you
sorry
you busy?
oi parsa
aight 
i don’t think you gotta ask
but at the same time do whatever you want
i think you should wait for corswain to die
i wasnt 
but also
i was memeing
11/10
thats fuckin dank
l m a o
about the play
and yea but it was a while ago
lol nope
oh damn
just not anything about her
cause i know the name lotara sarrin
aint they popular?
why?
too bad i won’t fail no nut november otherwise i’d probably find this much funnier 
that face
l m a o
maybe at like lvl 7
and shave my guy's head
i'll probably change pictures a little ways in
but the second doesn't look like a lvl 2 boy
these two
it was between
nope
compulsive liar?
he straight lied
understandable 
only i wont know who he is
if i see him tomorrow im gonna be upset 
i think that might be a bad thing
wtf
i’ll whisper it to him
lmao
lmao
it was fuckin busy today, didnt have time
i wondered if it was him, and treated him how i would any customer
they scootered in on a thursday, and ordered tacos and lemonades
but it looks like he and his wife may frequent the place
prob doesn’t
ty
and he was wondering which?
hyperion public, why?
no nutting
yea
takes like a week assuming ur not a scrub
at least
if you lose i buy you a copy of absolver and you have to reach level 61
nope
make me do something you like
dude whatever
even the barb can
you're probably right
lmao
def not
nope
thatd be dank
and you’d lose less health casting less cantrips
cause that shit gay
oyea it is
its not any weapon?
thats when you’d use it
we come across another one of those bullshit werewolves 
but shillelagh is pretty dank vs monsters
that and magic stone are the only bonus action cantrips though
yea
which is... con?
but it also makes it scale off of your spellcasting modifier
shillelagh will make your weapon count as magical for resistances
bonus action cantrips are useful af
yo
especially if you rp the vomiting
that’ll be a dank meme
lmao
i cast guida-BLAGHHUHHH
lmao
that’d be useful
i didnt take mending so
nice
the range is nice but you probably do more damage per turn with your weapon
cast every cantrip at the cost of 5 health
back in space jam that was gonna be the dialect for thieves cant
[1540099188] Parsa Jour: B L A C K S P E E CH

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
and doesn’t even make it something u can act out
fuckin stole my shit
we’re being babysitted so eric can throw harder combat at us
they’re at least lvl 4 from what i’ve seen of their rolls
we’re not babysitting 
i saw that
oh
nope
shit
uhh
and we'll have a bit of a druid later
so we have a bard rn for heals
cleric is playing bard
not anymore
and eric charges out the ass for health potions
not that we have a healer
or give you a pocket healer or something
so we just gotta make you a bad target
oof
and then run people down with your horse?
so what's the play there? you stand still and kill everyone who tries to go past you?
charger, right?
that's pretty fuckin dope
oh
is it just a figher on a horse?
how does a cavalier work btw?
true
that means i get 600 ft eldritch blasts, right?
if i take extended spell
assuming i take eldritch spear and get 300 ft eldritch blasts
so
well you can plan for one or you can not
and just flavor it like that demon fucker’s doing all the casting
probably another warlock, but maybe a shadow sorcerer 
possessed by that thing
from the background
the daughter
and also change stats and details to fit
thats i’d go 50 if i was using the first picture 
theres a time skip that i didn’t do a great job of showing
43-44
some of that shit is gross
thanks for the help with the grammar
im not going for cute
im leaning for the first two
as for the current nigga
i already got a backup
when this nigga dies
and then
4 different styles
4 pictures
now
Etan Hojart Harrikson was born a Broken of Izoldazal. He grew up with alone with his mother, because the N'rexal took his father and sacrificed him for conspiring in plots against the empire. Etan's mother, Sverri, raised him with tales of their homeland far to the North, where clan Hojart once set its roots: Oathe Hojart, the first of Clan Hojart, used to bring offerings of food to the injured Jotunn warchiefs who, once too old or too wounded to continue to fight, lived in the peaks of the mountains across the valley of Hojart's village. They blessed him and his descendants with giant's blood, and Hojart used it the gift of the Jotun to conquer half of the Northern clans and bring about lifetime of peace for his family. That (Here, Etan's mother would poke the boy in the chest with an outstretched finger) is why all the boys of Clan Hojart grow up to be the tallest, strongest, and most handsome men there are, and why the all the girls grow up to be the toughest, yet still the most fair of all realms. Etan Hojart didn't grow to be all that tall or strong. He was weak and he work the Taskmasters had him do was hard. Yet he put forth as much effort as he could, and he always the loudest when he shouted his devotion to Izoldazal. He did all he could to prove that he and his mother were loyal subjects that were not to be silently pulled out of the camps and sacrificed, and for the most part he was treated fairly. He had few friends, but among them was Daren, who lived two homes over from Etan. The two of them grew up together, and they shared everything.One night, after a long day's work, Daren shared that he'd met a friend of a friend of an agent of the Vard, and he had begun to help deliver secret letters between agents. When speaking of the Vard, Daren's eyes were alight with passion and hope. He believed that one day, the Vard would come and rescue their encampment from their dreadful broken existence. Etan believed that when the Taskmasters caught his idiot friend delivering those stupid letters, he'd be stolen away and sacrificed to the dark god and his fiery blood join with all the others as it ran down the grooves of a golden pyramid and in to the sodden red dirt. Etan tried to sway Daren away from that foolish business, but Daren wouldn't listen. They fought, loudly, viciously. So viciously that they attracted the ire of a passing Taskmaster, who told them to be silent and head to their respective homes for the rest of the night. At which Daren said, "Oh yeah? Or else what?"Twenty lashes are not fun. Twenty lashes for an idiotic comment that one did not say, that had no business being said at all? Infuriating. As Etan and Daren were being ushered off separately to their respective homes, Etan told the Qthraa tugging him by the chains that Daren had told him he was delivering messages for the Vard. The next morning, Daren's home had been raided. Daren was gone, his mother and father were splattered across the floor, and the only thing left of his year old sister was a foot left at the base of her cradle. Nobody knew why. Etan did, though.Soon after, Etan and his mother were moved to a new encampment. The work was easier, the smell was less foul, and their clothes had less patches and holes. Etan felt sick. Constantly. Every moment he spent in that new sweet smelling camp reminded him of that awful treachery he'd committed. Rations of freshly baked bread. A baby's foot left on the floor. The bright flowers he spent his days planting. splatters of brain matter on the clay wall. He wanted to die. He didn't deserve anything else. A fellow worker slipped and dropped a glass vase, Etan was the first to offer to pick it up. He slipped a long, sharp shard into his the pocket of his vest. At night, Etan pulled the shard of glass from his pocket and held the point to his throat. This would be it. His last day. Just push. But his hands wouldn't budge. Just push that terrifying needle of glass into your throat! And though his trembling, bleeding hands slipped and nicked the skin above his adam's apple, that was all they did. And he threw the bloody shard of glass away and wept, because he was afraid to die.Eventually, he stood up, silent, walked into the night outside of his home, and in a fit of utter madness. Began to run. East. Where the sun rises from endless water. Where the Vard make their encampment and prepare to strike the black empire off the face of Ancilus. Where people can live free from the watchful eyes of the N'rexal and their dark god. Where Etan can tell the Vard what he'd done to his only friend and begin to atone for his sins.But that was only a fantasy, for as soon as he reached the edge of the encampment, a Yi'lax'n guard shot him down and last thing he saw was the night sky, blocked by a sea of black clouds.The Q'thraa had Etan heavily drugged and carted off to the pyramids to be sacrificed. He doesn't remember the events surrounding the incident at the pyramids. He lived them in a haze, not quite awake, nor asleep. The next time he fully awoke, he was face to face with the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. Her palms on his chest glowed with a soft, golden light that soothed his tired mind. Etan asked her name. The elf replied Iliara, then deeming him sufficiently healed, she helped him up, and introduced him to the Vard.Iliara became Etan's first friend within the Vard. She was a young druid, and Etan spent most of his time assisting her in her duties, and Iliara taught him how harness some the magic within his veins, and cast some simple spells. Their friendship grew quickly to something more, and eventually Iliara bore Etan's child, a daughter, Tobin.Etan joined the Resistance soon after, to try and bring an end to the black empire so his daughter might one day see the valleys and mountains and stories of his homeland, and to atone in some small way for causing the death of his old friend.
Etan Hojart Harrikson was born a Broken of Izoldazal. He grew up with alone with his mother, because the N'rexal took his father and sacrificed him for conspiring in plots against the empire. Etan's mother, Sverri, raised him with tales of their homeland far to the North, where clan Hojart once set its roots: Oathe Hojart, the first of Clan Hojart, used to bring offerings of food to the injured Jotunn warchiefs who, once too old or too wounded to continue to fight, lived in the peaks of the mountains across the valley of Hojart's village. They blessed him and his descendants with giant's blood, and Hojart used it the gift of the Jotun to conquer half of the Northern clans and bring about lifetime of peace for his family. That (Here, Etan's mother would poke the boy in the chest with an outstretched finger) is why all the boys of Clan Hojart grow up to be the tallest, strongest, and most handsome men there are, and why the all the girls grow up to be the toughest, yet still the most fair of all realms. Etan Hojart didn't grow to be all that tall or strong. He was weak and he work the Taskmasters had him do was hard. Yet he put forth as much effort as he could, and he always the loudest when he shouted his devotion to Izoldazal. He did all he could to prove that he and his mother were loyal subjects that were not to be silently pulled out of the camps and sacrificed, and for the most part he was treated fairly. He had few friends, but among them was Daren, who lived two homes over from Etan. The two of them grew up together, and they shared everything.One night, after a long day's work, Daren shared that he'd met a friend of a friend of an agent of the Vard, and he had begun to help deliver secret letters between agents. When speaking of the Vard, Daren's eyes were alight with passion and hope. He believed that one day, the Vard would come and rescue their encampment from their dreadful broken existence. Etan believed that when the Taskmasters caught his idiot friend delivering those stupid letters, he'd be stolen away and sacrificed to the dark god and his fiery blood join with all the others as it ran down the grooves of a golden pyramid and in to the sodden red dirt. Etan tried to sway Daren away from that foolish business, but Daren wouldn't listen. They fought, loudly, viciously. So viciously that they attracted the ire of a passing Taskmaster, who told them to be silent and head to their respective homes for the rest of the night. At which Daren said, "Oh yeah? Or else what?"Twenty lashes are not fun. Twenty lashes for an idiotic comment that one did not say, that had no business being said at all? Infuriating. As Etan and Daren were being ushered off separately to their respective homes, Etan told the Qthraa tugging him by the chains that Daren had told him he was delivering messages for the Vard. The next morning, Daren's home had been raided. Daren was gone, his mother and father were splattered across the floor, and the only thing left of his year old sister was a foot left at the base of her cradle. Nobody knew why. Etan did, though.Soon after, Etan and his mother were moved to a new encampment. The work was easier, the smell was less foul, and their clothes had less patches and holes. Etan felt sick. Constantly. Every moment he spent in that new sweet smelling camp reminded him of that awful treachery he'd committed. Rations of freshly baked bread. A baby's foot left on the floor. The bright flowers he spent his days planting. splatters of brain matter on the clay wall. He wanted to die. He didn't deserve anything else. A fellow worker slipped and dropped a glass vase, Etan was the first to offer to pick it up. He slipped a long, sharp shard into his the pocket of his vest. At night, Etan pulled the shard of glass from his pocket and held the point to his throat. This would be it. His last day. Just push. But his hands wouldn't budge. Just push that terrifying needle of glass into your throat! And though his trembling, bleeding hands slipped and nicked the skin above his adam's apple, that was all they did. And he threw the bloody shard of glass away and wept, because he was afraid to die.Eventually, he stood up, silent, walked into the night outside of his home, and in a fit of utter madness. Began to run. East. Where the sun rises from endless water. Where the Vard make their encampment and prepare to strike the black empire off the face of Ancilus. Where people can live free from the watchful eyes of the N'rexal and their dark god.

how evil do u get?
over and over again
that literally just say evil
he's wearing pants
some lit ass shit right there
in my heart i just wanna be this
cc?
drafted into the army because of the political sway he holds over his township
lul

I'm gonna make my devil gangster
Shit
GUNS
GUND
holy fucking shit
what
1700s  a m e r i c a?
w a i t
i guess ur waiting for space jam, huh
yup
i want a deck of many things in session 2
that shit’s VERY gay
neither do i tbh
just memeing
or just wait for him to give us x op item and take it
probably true
that and a couple of the subclass skills
metamagic is the only good part of sorc
sorclock
thats what i was thinking actually 
yeah
i dont want to be a blade pact
multiclass something with warlock
oh
*like some sort of
i guess i’ll play like a some sort of warmage
wanna kms
yea
that's generally the rule of thumb with bratty children
but waiting is a good idea
no he does
oh
that's what he told me he did
and he unfriended u on everything right?
oof
u still going with the admech type character?
for the new campaign
so i'm gathering randos off reddit again
what i want actually, is just to have a campaign thats half as good as the all guardsmen party
in my campaign 
i’d love to see that
yes
fuck you eric suck my balls
“i don't really want either to be a gunslinger”
this is what eric told me
ikr
eric said he wasn’t too into us using guns tho
and punch with bonus actions
and would cast spells
who used a rifle like a bo staff
i was gonna be like a monk wizard multiclass
nah
you were stealin my idea, my guy?
parsa you were making a gunslinger?
and thats what the boys want
playing witcher made me wanna do fantasy
i’ll start campaign 
if it comes down to it tho and milo says nvm fuck that shit
i know
that's very very dank
that's fuckin dank
i also like being able to quickened spell and cast double magic missile
that said
as seen by you being vaporized for being mean to the bbeg
eric's world currently is
i like having a bullshit character if the world is befitting of bullshit
though, i probably liked it more just cause his version of action economy left everyone ridiculously op
he can pace shit out well
despite the memes and milo's general being autistic
that's why i liked milo's a lot more
yes
it's just too fast
yes
which is what he wanted us to do in the first place
and in the process of that, join the city's thieves guild
it would have made much more sense for us to have to hide out for a while
becoming her servants for no reason felt incredibly forced
yes
no that was fine, i think
because the second session we impersonated a noble to sneak into a castle in order to get paid, and then we became servants to some ancient noblewoman for little to no reason, and despite the fact that we were essentially caught impersonating the noblewoman, we didn't get punished whatsoever
actually only one session
2 sessions of being normal
we had
yeh
but that coupled with the fact that eric gets salty when characters leave/die is a problem
last campaign i didn't have that problem since i made some retarded ass character
that's pretty much my entire problem with this campaign rn
but i want to bum around taverns and be normal
yes
so i’ll give it another week
too lazy
i ended up not talking to him
i just work every weekend, mondays and sometimes tuesdays
i just work every weekend, mondays and sometimes tuesdays
my days off are mid week
lol no
but i gotta leave to go to work in an hour
not rn
no
we ought to kill him anyway
we can do that in two turns
that's ez
what
maybe yeah
ahn?
you were technically asleep
i mean what could you have done
yeah
too much shit
yeah the maps are what ruin it
anyway eric’s story feels a bit like a bunch of shit just happening to us for little to no reason
there u go
then when he acts accordingly to that new trait give em inspiration 
yeah thatd be nice
so we kinda need it cause eric wont scale down combat
and it makes all of us strong
because the item is op
i dont mind it
well what it is right now
yes
5 weeks in a fuckin row
but this
yea neither do i
i just got on skype now tho
same
will do tho
i went to sleep
ah
i turned down like 6 dudes because i saw atlas first
it does but thats life
*3 hours ahead of us
who doesn't live 3 hours behind
so we find a new dude
and he falls asleep in every session
he never talks
the dude's never on
i have a solution
sounds good lmfao
and is very good you should try it out sometime
which got a new pve expansion 
im gonna not take it as a sign of the apocalypse and instead go play some absolver
thats not unusual 
lets go to the underdark and kill every single living thing down there
yuh
imo
well you pretend to work with him, figure out what he wants and how he’ll get it then double cross him for the ultimate cuck
izoldi?
yeah THAT one came outta left field
at the very least i like that people are somewhat interested in what’s going on.
sweet
well also out of a sense of obligation since its been so long
plus i do want to bring back space jam and im wondering if im the only one who’s in eric’s campaign just because its the only campaign available
cause atlas asked me the same thing yesterday and i thought it was cool of him
that was intentional by eric just so you know
you’re probably at work, what what’re your thoughts on the state of the campaign?
yo parsa
I'll pretend to be very upset that you got me attacked and it will fool you
wo i cant read this till i get home
oh my god
she'll have 1 minute lmfao
but it's a big fucking soul
hes not gonna miss this one either
true
lmao wat
but if it's just u idk if i'll be able to run it anyway
i'll call again
at work
thinking ahead :O

which is awesome
as connor
you can kill them
yea but
i just know that connor can be a stone cold killer throughout the entire game and you dont get the obligatory “you were bad, evil, everyone is sad” ending
who tf is david cage?
i havent played it
apparently that game’s story is actually good
detroit become robot
is that
wtf
y e p
good luck man
i start in 30 minutes
oof
but it's fucking fantastic
while i'm sewing a dead man's head onto a living man's ass.
what do you think I am, an amateur 
pretty hilarious
that is
go for it
well whatever it is
oh :0
angle????
?
dont even tell me and give me time to prepare
any time you wanna reprimand me for being a bad girl just go ahead
 but yea
since eric mentionef the sword
i’ve been planning responses
im okay with it
peace
same
.________.
.
it means the latter
lul
girl power moments?
i liked playing team dipshit
yea
def not deep speech
yea
probably dwarvish or duergar
common, halfling, and draconic im pretty sure

a good character on paper, but i wasnt a good person to act him
that was part of why i disliked playing him
i couldnt do hansa’s voice most of the time
very very fair
but cio’s has an inconsistent pitch at the best of times
i thought vilde’s was spot on tbh
is it vilde’s?
but its on
i needed to pratice it
absolutely
if you mean a character voice, then yea
cio’ll talk like that
it does
yeye
nobody talks like that
like: As i looked out the window, I saw a most peculiar sight that frightened me greatly.
i mean like the whole sentence structure sounds like it was meant to be in a letter
btw i dont mean wonky grammar when i say victorian style english
I APOLOGIZE 
 FUCK
2-3 hours
maybe in like
im not gonna ask now
or maybe it was the 21st
eric said he couldnt until the 26th?
2 pitchers of ale?
so like
i dont think ciocie cioelle would ever be called anything other than a lightweight 
i’ve got 5
LUL
in terms of maturity
cio’s like a good 10 years behind where she should be
as long as you dont count the fact that
but from like an age/maturity standpoint they’re similar
technically
that was just a phase, mom
that was just a phase mom
no, def not
fair
cio would never let you use that despicable magic on her
also
lmao
i doubt cure wounds gives you deadpool baby flesh
the scars
years old
but they’re like
one scar on the face, one eye that isnt originally hers
when the narrator sounds like that
writing voice
like
i just hate that victorian english voice in general 
it honestly didnt turn out terrible
i wanted to
idk
yea sounds fair
but she doesnt know anything about anything when it comes to sex
and gross
In general she finds sex pretty abhorrent
Cio doesn’t have a preference.
oh
that’s fine
Nah
or maybe for wealthy people when they live out in the edges of the country and arent magical themselves
surgeons are for middle/low class people and soldiers
exactly why i was doing it that way
y e p
idk
so poor people need something
magic is for rich people tho
yeah
she’s a social retard
*right
but doesn’t use it righg
cio chose a good paying profession
well then thats good for me i guess
ok
as well
she probably gives you like 90% of her money
well they’re yours anyway
also is this their first time getting shwaysted?
it looks like that
mhm
yea out of the pool of black evil shit
that stuff was my shit
bruh
s i c k
also that they’re yours if something were to happen to her and that the key to the study is buried in the garden, and that they’re worth a lot of gold
she also talks a lot about her father’s study and how she really wants to go back and take all the books there.
those bandits are alive and cio would very much like to one day orchestrate their being not alive
but the ones on her face are from bandits
most on het back and legs are from her aunt’s maids
and you’d know where they came from
and that she doesnt like people seeing her without a lot of clothes. You probably would have seen that she has a lot of scars
you’d know that cio takes parts off of just about every monster they kill
burnt grove
Oh thats where i got the fire from
or smth
or with a black gate inside
its a grove of trees on fire?
yea
so i can show it to people
i’d have it drawn in a notebook
very fair
okay
okok
sounds good
just came ahead of him
oh yea 
and cio came from the south
cause directly west is through falconrest
so southwest
ok west
altruistic to the core
well that’s what cio does
which direction did we come from
we’ve gone city to city, mending broken bones for spare clothes, leftover soup, and pocket change, while searching for clues about Tyrion
but thats a quarter of a continent away
*home
also she does mind going hone
as long as its not miss ronnenfeldt
she doesn’t care what you call her
cio doesn’t quite mind going anywhere ever
comes out with 3 bibbas
one guy walks into a bar
the same way you introduce a whole party
and ideas
but also doodles
more like sketches of things
nah
a lot a lot
like
cio draws a lot
*very
cery fair
sure
if need be
all the someones
like
cio would likely kill multiple someones
she’d probably want to tell you about the killing people thing, but is too afraid to do so
cio would trust the shit out of ya
probably
sober and wasted
i got two voices bruh
cio would probably see valyra as either her best friend ever, or  family
i feel like if we’re extending the time
the vilde voice was very good
nice
have a voice for your bih yet?
do you
parsa
yea
yea
couch
nice
lul
and cio's the latter
clearly you're the former
oh that's fine
don't tell me you made a carpet muncher
and they're like
to get a doctor's license
that means you're like
the aunt's alive too
it'd probably be to never ever go back home, ever, unless it was to kill her uncle and burn the whole place to the ground.
that wasn't, become the best doctor by any means, and maybe have a little fun killing some random people in the process
but he hasn't said to change it yet
"oh shit i can just fuck my niece."
"oh shit i can just fuck my niece.
they'll succ u till you're retarded
it's true
at least drow didn't go blind
[6/7/2018 6:23:50 PM] Parsa Jour: Valyra's only experience with surfacers were the times she was ordered to hunt &lt;&lt;&lt;
lmao ok
this is some good shit
very fair
sounds good
whichever you prefer
actually idk
underdark i think
when they bring kindred back
i’ll play league of legends next patch
i don't want to play no league of legends
coulda been back an hour ago
its cause i ate there that it took so long tbh
but i’ll be back in like 10 mins
no
i've gotta sleep
i didn't
it's not done
i guess it's up for grabs
what're u at?
im thinking of pushing it down to 4'9
little spoon by default
cio’s 5’2
would your waifu lookin boi even want to spoon with cio’s ugly ass?
idk
I think we do
and if someone needs medical attention she’ll set up shop in the tent
hell yea
its a 2 person
i’ll set up my tent and sleep there
i wont even be sleeping in inns with you guys
oh hell yea man
its only if any person catches her eye. 
she wont actually kill a lot
then she moves on to the next town
she operates mostly in slums, helps as many people as possible by day, until she runs out of either food, money, or patients that can actually pay her
nah
she’s not gonna stick around in a city once she’s killed more than two people
well yeah
its more like disinterest
reserved is the wrong word
once she gets going on a topic she gets GOING
but like
she’s pretty reserved most of the time
yeah
hmm
she’d tell you that she’s very very very dedicated to her craft
all in the name of science, of course
you’d probably know that she’s messed around with a dead patient before and drew all his parts
very fair
or the be the greatest doctor ever
the kill everything and everyone, as brutalsome and gruesomely as possible goal?
which goals?
yea definitely
oh cool
why?
i like
stands to reason she’d want a companion, especially a ranger
its why she’s currently poor as shit
cio’s been fucked up by bandits once before
yeah thats fair
Can i draw a bit of blood?
idfk
uhhh
Where are you from?
What are you?
uh
sounds good
o ye?
why not play jane the ripper who was molested, mentally and physically abused, and unloved with dead parents all at the ripe age of fourteen?
if im gonna play jane the ripper
but look at it this way
when they ask
and you as in the group
but i’ll only give you the tldr
like i feel like i’ll write it all out
idk too much either
after i finished writing all that
oh yeah
yep
ye
the aunt was abusive
naw dude the uncle just molested her and made her suck his dick a few times
She could never find out, of course. She couldn't ask her father, he was a brain-dead fool half the time, and a raving lunatic for the rest. Instead she decided she'd figure it out herself. So began her experiments. She'd spend days sketching people, animals, plants, buildings, anything that caught her eye. She found quickly that she had a knack for it. She had light, steady hands, with nimble fingers, and her eyes could pick out the hairs on a handmaiden's arm from the other side of the room. She'd catch frogs by the river and cut them open with a kitchen knife, then draw what was inside. When she was feeling especially miserable, Cio would make shallow cuts on her own arms and sew them shut for practice. She would raid her father's closets for anesthetics, anodynes, opiates, or sedatives, anything she could get her hands on that might dull her senses.​From nearly twelve years old until she was nearing fourteen, Ciocie carried on in this manner, but a single side comment from her uncle at the dinner table, "I say, Cio, you're beginning to become the living image of your mother." For the first time in her life, Cio's uncle started to notice her, he grew a sudden interest in her comings and goings, and her dress and posture. "Keep your chin up, Cio, that way we can see those marvelous eyes of yours," he'd say. Suddenly, her uncle couldn't seem to keep his hands off her. He would push her back and hold her shoulders to show her how a lady ought to stand, move her knees into position to show her how a lady ought to sit. Pet her hair and hold her chin, tilting her face toward the windows, so the light fell onto it in a way he seemed to like. Then he began asking her if she'd like to play with him.​"We could play doctor!" He'd say with a smile. "Doctors are very respectable, like your father, oh he was grand." Then he'd lay her down on her bed and carefully cut the clothes off her with a pair of scissors. He'd check her temperature and feel for her pulse. He would make sure to give Cio a full examination, checking each and every corner, poking and prodding and rubbing, all while whispering, "My my, what gorgeous eyes, you have."  "My my, what wonderful lips." "My my." "My my."​The words called to her in her sleep, then she'd wake with a start to hear knocking on her door, and her Uncle would come in, asking her for a check up under his breeches. Most times Cio would play the patient, but there were plenty of times when she was the one doing the checking, touching, prodding and feeling. Her uncle would guide her to the places where he was hurting the most, and Cio would silently follow his lead.​Their games didn't go unnoticed by Cio's aunt. But she didn't seem to hate her husband. She knew men had needs. The fault lied with Cio, the devil girl who chased away head-nurses like cats chase mice. Cio's  spiteful common blood had drawn her husband's eyes and the girl needed to be reminded of her place. When Cio would emerge from her room after a long game of "doctor," a handmaiden would be waiting for her, to bring her to the cellars, where she'd be beaten bloody with brooms and belts and spoons and ladles. Ciocie Cioelle was a bad child and she would be made to know it.​
it's about the impact
the quantity isn't shit
no it's not
it's technically correct
plus i still haven't shaken off that uh
it'll be there
don't read that wall of text
Ciocie Cioelle Astoria von Ronnenfeldt was born in the small barony of Runnerfield. Her father was the renowned surgeon: Sir Arturem Astoria, and her mother was Iriel von Ronnenfeldt, the eldest daughter of the local baron often considered one of, if not the most beautiful woman in all of Prince ___'s princedom. On the night Cio was born, her father had been away for three weeks, serving in his prince's army in the war against Velenel. That meant that when Iriel lost far too much blood during childbirth, there were no doctors competent enough to save her. She died that night, and Cio fell into the care of her uncle and his wife.When Arturem recieved word of his wife's death, he made plans to return straight home, yet his encampment was attacked that same night, and he was knocked unconscious by a stray chunk of rubble and trampled by a startled horse. It took two months for Arturem to return home, and by the time he'd arrived he had changed drastically, barely a shadow of the man he once was. Healing magic had preserved his life, but the army's doctors couldn't save his body. He was left with one amputated hand, and one horribly disfigured one, a stunted back and a lame knee. He spent his days locked inside of Iriel's bedroom, alone, with nothing but his thoughts and a slew of liquor.Cio was raised by a long list of headnurses and handmaidens. None of whom could ever keep track of her, most of them would quit in a huff after the first, week calling the girl a fiend or a devil and storming out the front door. They weren't wrong. Cio refused to follow instruction, scoffed at the idea of learning whatever her teachers had in store for her. To Ciocie, all adults were liars and schemers, her aunt's handmaidens poisoning her father day after day, while her uncle sings stories of how great of a man he was and how wonderfully beautiful his sister is, and how one day Cio might hope to have half her father's talent and half her mother's beauty. Liars, her mother's dead. She'd heard her father scream it during one of his fits. Her father is worthless, he says it himself every day. Cio's family is a family of liars and they hate her father and they hate her because they have ugly common blood.Cio's life was a mess, one miserable day after another, until the day came when she was rummaging through her father's pockets in his sleep, she found the key to his study. Her father's study was behind a heavy door at the end of the last hall on the third floor. Inside, all the curtains were drawn and a thin layer of dust covered everything. But there were books. Rows upon rows of books each a cache of her father's knowledge, each adding a little bit of proof that her father might have once been the man everyone claims. Cio read them all multiple times over, whenever she had the chance she would escape to that study and read learn. What interested her most were her father's sketches: body parts in detail, of humans, goliaths, dragonborn, halflings, and plenty of races she'd never heard of. First there were drawings of the skin, with labels for muscles, arteries, and joints. Then drawings of skeletons, covered in labels and names. Then drawings of parts without the skin, there weren't many of them, but in the few there were, the detail was exquisite. There was a wealth of information in every strand of muscle, every pencilstroke on the page. Cio was enthralled. Was it accurate? Cio felt her arm, it felt like it was. But where could anyone come across information like that?
i've been at this one for like 2 days
yeh it'd be gay if it wasn't
LUL
?
did you call him a weeb
whatd you say?
and are right
cause fire emblem devs think weebs are dumb
they’re also the easiest version of the game
yes
it's like
we're not
but like the dude's not a weeb
that's what i said
he's thinking of rolling a samurai fighter
naw he's not playing a chick anymore
but it sounds remarkably not cancerous if he plays it right
my phone died for a sec
sorry
oh
oh
did you hear about milo’s new weeb character?
but i don't want to
fucking gay
lets get that bibba in this bitccccchhhhh
but yea
but it’ll take like 2 more to get into my apartment 
it took me 5 mins to get to my apartment
damn i was half right
agreed
yea
5 mins away
im like
walking home
fuck man, im dead broke
dead broke?
are you
joking
you owe me 5 gp
sounds good
she has her credentials and swore all her doctor’s oathes
technically
yes
so like
pretty sure milo’s gonna end up playing a girl
yea man
we just dicked around?
yea but what the fuck did we do?
so that the party doesnt hate each other
make them backstories work

Fast HandsStarting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.
you don't have to wake up at like 7
but it's not far to class right?
like he's told me he's not a fan of milo's guy
eric doesn't like characters that just run around killing shit
i've noticed that
eric doesn't kill pcs often
then i'll swap late
so she doesn't look all kinds of fucked up
this'll be great
holy fuck this is everything i've ever wanted
i don't want to lose hansa
god damn that one's fuckin awesome
this one's the best yet by far
this one's fucking awesome
idk it's too
plus hansa doesn't look like the kind of guy who knows anything about anything
im surprised nobody's done it
they're coming to attack eventually
there wasn't really anything to say
from eric's side i was probably a lot less passive
i didn't say much at all
im just wondering what you're tryna get at
since i was trying to go for a character that's pretty reserved
the problem is that hansa wouldn't bring up those issues himself unless it was absolutely necessary
there's been nothing so far that's brought them together yet
but like the characters aren't friends or anything yet
not "Nobody should kill"
his viewpoint is "I do not kill."
that's not his viewpoint
he doesn't think it's abhorrent
because it's not his job to change how you act
but he's not gonna bring that up
isn't like
he just won't do it himself
but its not like he doesn't realize that things die
hansa isn't a confrontational person
he's not a strong character
hansa doesn't give a shit what other people believe
but eric decided he'd give me a sword
i'll drop hansa if eric fucks him up enough
i don't want to lose hansa
or doesn't die
i won't bring it up until hansa dies
then you're a drow
normal elves don't get mask of many faces
im thinking i'll just go full rogue with a specialization in alchemy or something, and sneak attack with scalpels or something.
guess who's also got a new character ready?
2 but we didnt do anything at level 2
i mean you’re level 1
you could
i’ve kinda gotta go with that one
so much better
the quality of the first is like
well
i see
*flower i’d say this one
if it wasnt for the flowe
oh based on the pictures
do whatever you want
fuck it
sounds cool though
no
i mean unka unk was a fucking meme and a half, but he didn't play him like one
that actually doesn't sound terrible
i'm set for whenever
so not cancerous 
sounds
Hansa has few memories of his childhood, but they all begin after a short, yet vivid one of him being lead by one of the masters, down the long corridors of the monastery where he grew up. His small hand, gripped gently by the well worn and wrinkled ones of Master Parvat Sikhar Thand. His robes, a miniature replicate of the ones worn by the elderly man next to him, scratched along the cold stone floors. Everything in the monastery was cold when he was young, from the floors to the walls to the clay pots and pans, just moments after coming out of the firepits for the evening meals. The temple lay beneath the peak of the Pryat Naahn, where the cold will prickle your skin even through the thickest clothing. Yet despite the cold, Hansa remembers those halls filled with the echoes of soft music and the warm smiles of masters and students as they passed. The cold didn't touch those people. Hansa remembers those times fondly. Hansa was 12 years old when Master Thand died, with his passing a quiet fell over the monastery. The walls grew colder. The lamps burned duller. The halls and corridors lost their former luster. No longer could one hear the echoing of laughter around every corner, or the chimes of bells left in open windows for the wind to ring. The music hall was left empty, for there was work to be done. In Hansa's case, his studies and training overtook much of his free time. The masters pushed the young students into physical training, which meant combat.In all his years at the monastery, Hansa felt as if he were always a step behind the other children. He learned to read and write, late. He could never paint well, had trouble reading maps, always burned himself lighting candles. The only activity he found any true comfort in was music, but even that was taken away with the death of Master Thand. But when it came to combat, Hansa shined above all others. Hansa found that fighting and music were not all that dissimilar, and in practice bouts with the other children, Hansa danced to the beat of a deadly drum. Despite all this, Hansa was dismayed to find that his teachers didn't seem to appreciate Hansa's newfound martial prowess. "Agressive," they called him. "Belligerent, brutish, and hostile," they said in their reports to the masters. They believed Hansa exhibited traits unbecoming of a servant of the Daughter. He was reprimanded for his aggressive ways, and was separated from the other children, until he could learn to respect and love all his fellow beings.After two months of separation, Hansa came to an understanding while reading through the Scrolls of the Exalts for the third time. The issue was not with his skill in combat, but his eagerness to perform it. He was always the first to jump into the sparring ring, and the first to strike in any match. Any true disciple of the Daughter and surely any true hero worth counting among the Exalts, knows that a balance must be held between their duties and their desires. Hansa has been given a duty by the Daughter, to respect the world and its inhabitants, to be a beacon of peace, warmth, and hope for all to see. And if he cannot temper his desire to sing songs of violence, then he is undeserving of the title of White Chain. With his head bowed, he told his teachers thus, and they smiled.In the years that followed, Hansa completed his formal training with the other children, and earned the white chain he wears around his neck. At the Chain ceremony, Hansa and his peers were each given a scroll containing instructions for when they so choose to descend the mountain and look outward to the world for the next step of their training. And so Hansa packed his meager possessions, and made his way down the mountain.
it can't have been that different
i mean we probably wouldn't
but that's cause he was a bool and didn't drink the well water
and for like a third of the fight she wasn't using any
we don't have haste on anyone
in eric's world
which sucks cause you'll be in range of her melee attacks
we can't just bull rush her like fools tho
which isn't hard
since he's giving us the people with all the bonuses
if milo can hold person her she's fucked
i've got 25
we're fucking him up
don't have to just kill
that's all that matters
it's fine
i'll play this asap tho
i think i'm gonna do the same
it honestly doesn't get better than this shit
that shit's a 10/10
tbh i think it's better than the first one
i've got
i won't
that's japs for you
i mean that shit's fine
nobody in the town met yew's dad
she doesn't dislike humans anymore, she just hadn't met them
so can't ask
i don't remember what eric named him
where a bitch gonna learn thieve's can't if not from other thieves?
but she's not the type
i couldn't think of a good reason a CG elven ranger who grew up in a small forest town would go about breaking into houses and taking things from people, without some external pushing in that direction.
isn't anything like that in what i imagine as ilvyndell
so even if it's not longer it looks longer
Lyreth was born in the small town of Ilvyndell, west of the wailing wood. Her mother was good friends with the Village psion, Leyna. She was similarly facinated by Leyna's baby who seemed to grow at thrice the rate of other elf children. She learned later (after a long conversation with her parents) that was because he was only half elven, with a human father that lived far off in the Human lands of Gisildor. Lyreth grew up in the trees, hunting, climbing, watching, and sneaking about in perches high above the ground. She always kept an eye out for the other elven children, and noticed fairly quickly how often they seemed to leave out the half-elf boy. Lyreth took it upon herself to be his friend. Sweetyew, he introduced himself as, as if it were the greatest, name in the world. He was weird, she couldn't deny that, but so was she. They became fast friends.As time passed, they each grew in their own right. Lyreth, following the ministrations of her mother, took up the bow and learned to hunt. While Yew practiced the art of channeling his mind. With him around, even when hunting in the outskirts of Ilvyndell, she was never quite lost for company, especially with Yew's sudden and insatiable attention to all the pretty, ditzy village maidens and how their short skirts flare when they pick berries amidst the trees. There was always an argument to have over stupid things like that, that would draw her attention away from the long hours of stalking the forests. It was possibly a little more of a nuisance than she would have liked, but it was something.Then the day came when Yew confessed to Lyreth that he had a strong urge to leave their town and explore the world. The thought hadn't ever crossed her mind. "Leave Ilvyndell?" She thought, "What for? There's nothing out there but fiendish fey and stupid humans." Yet, nothing she said could sway him from this new path of his. Eventually, the stubborn bastard found the courage to pack his bags, grab his father's sword and leave, spouting some nonsense about "making a name for himself, or making a better, grander place for everyone."With him gone, the days spent in the woods grew quiet, but she found herself reveling in the silence, the sounds of wind and birdsong in the trees, the calm. She could picture herself walking through forests like these forever, or climbing tall hills, or mountains, or grassy plains, or snow covered hills... Suddenly she could understand Yew's fascination with the outside. It wasn't long before Lyreth, too, packed up and went on her own way.Before she left, her mother presented her with a gift: Anyeira, Fanvara's bow. She didn't quite understand all the ceremony behind it, but appreciated it none the less. Something to remember home by. Plus it was quite the marvel in and of itself. She always admired it in it's place above the mantelpiece. It was a week into her travels that she realized the single gravest mistake she'd made. She forgot to bring any coin. Without coin she couldn't buy food from the travelling peddlers, and she couldn't cook, so she had to rely on the rations she brought, and when that ran out... Lyreth just had to hope she could find a town where she could sell some of her stuff beforehand.With some direction, and help from other travelers, she managed her way to a small city by the coast, teeming with humans. She'd run out of rations two days ago, and was starving. The first thing she did was snatch a loaf of bread from a nearby bakery, resolving to pay the man back someday soon. This act didn't go unnoticed, but not by anyone she'd expected. As she sat down in a stairway to watch the ocean and eat, she was approached by a man, who'd caught a glimpse of her quick fingers. He Introduced himself as Rook noted she had some potential for larceny, that he was trying to start a guild, and that for potential like hers. All Lyreth wanted to know was if there was food involved.During the years spent with the guild, Lyreth became good friends with Rook, they'd have dinner's at his home with his wife and child, and she'd tell stories of her childhood in Ilvyndell with Yew. Life was good, up until a new recruit had a run-in with the town guards that went sour, and the fool told them everything he knew in order to stay out of prison. The guards were on their doorstep before nightfall, and the guild was routed in an instant. Lyreth barely had time to grab her bow, her gear, and a half-sack of coins before escaping through a window.Leaving the city behind, she found herself back in the wilderness again, but outfitted with a bit more experience this time around. She ran into a knight, with whom she adventured with for a while, until they heard note of an adventurer named Yew Pravaal, and how he and a few others had slain the Outlander. Lyreth set out immediately to find her old friend.
bring it the fuck on
we’ll see
rooks the reason she has 6 levels in rogue
bruh i just pulled some bullshit out my ass
yea
Lol
GET fucked

nope
that's super good
it's pretty alright
but aside from that it's fine
between Alestid the name and Alestid the house
and it only works because you're using different usages of the word
tiefling spells aren't all that lmao
rly wouldn't have needed 2 rogues in ancilus
*good
well thats ood
aight
we havent even had session 1
dont get hooked on the idea yet please?
Another useful tool for pretty much any RPG is to ask each individual player to list what sorts of movies, books, TV shows, etc. they think of for the genre of game you are playing. Basically, their personal "Appendix N" for the game. Someone who mainly sees your game as the RPG version of "The Road" has a different vision than the person playing "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" which is also different from the player who enjoys "The Stand".
Wielded by the hero, Fanvara, this longbow is carved with the story of the Grand Huntress's slaying of the Miquilitzcoatl (Death Serpent). Sung from the center of the Ashwood itself, the entirety of the bow's 6ft length is decorated with scenes of the Huntress chasing the beast across the land. Instead of a night sky across the scene, the stars are Sylvan glyphs that tell Anyeira's tale. These runes function as a blessing, imbuing the bow with the power of an Archfey prince. For those who wield her with honorable intent, the bow aims true and strikes with the promise of quick death. For those who seek to use her for evil means, Anyiera aims with the precision of a child's sling.Sylvan: "I am Anyiera Syn Ellun, the ending of light, Prince of the Everlight Theater. Mine is the arrow that never falters, the arrow that brings destruction to the destroyer. By my hand I have felled scores of other Archfey that sought my theater as their own. By my hand I have felled wyrms whose waking threatens kingdoms. By my hand I have felled the Miquilitzcoatl, the beast that sought to bring the world to heel. Draw me and behold the power to write legends and defy fate itself. It is in your hands, blood of Fanvara, all you need speak is the words of her promise."
it'd make my cancer levels dissipate immensely
that you'll need advantage on a spot and listen check?
if you don't want it don't add it tho
everyone's race choice is overtuned
it's looking more and more like
i've been doing lore shit
how'd it go?
yoinks
yoinke
huh
wait, me?

bullshitting with stuff that doesn't directly involve you guys
i mean that's just the premise
it's basically that
the premise is you're a team of sponsored artifact hunters, you track down signals and retrieve pieces of ancient tech to sell to the highest bidder
he's very down
i've asked milo
guns will be based off whatever they're based off
i'll probably just create a pantheon
but they're not gonna be active
we'll just balance it
o o p s
yeah
definitely my favorite of those
ye that one’s dope
that's all i could find
this one's tough
i can try
still quality
less thotty
oh yea probably
its much better than this shit
you’ll see eventually
i picked a totally different picture regardless
nvm it's fine
it's not a good ide
that's
had i had less balls and more self-preservation i'd still be here tho.
psion is technically homebrew cause its an adapted 3.5e class
still not over that
im fucjin
the copy pasted character
and i have no clue what miles is planning with letho
i dont think milo’s planning on swapping out gemi with init on the loose
yea
o dope
r i p
like whats in the air is wether or not anyone will be effective enough to stop me.
emperor to be
yea
gemi might try to stop
yew is going to make this kid shitty
its in the air
rn i think like
im just gonna hope yew lives as long as possible
then
alright
i mean
if you want to
yeah
yea
braum? plus garen????
but otherwise i guess its like
yea exactly
i guess vengence pally is basically an astartes space marine
i fuckin hate paladins cause i dont know how to do it
idk
had no idea what to do anymore
i was mostly over yew after he died and became a chaotic good high elf
naw lmao
all that arm stuff rly got to him lmao
yew cares way too much about looking cool 
pretty much
yes
but i was only acting in character
agreed
i tried baddie and am now sentenced to horrible character death for my sins
its more like
rip
we’re gonna have a good aligned party pretty soon then
omg
ok
g a y
pelor
yea
since like
i’m already planning mine too
r i p
its perfect
its a sun paladin
i’ll send
kk
lul
they just sent me another key
when i have money
idk when
this game and titanfall 2 cause im a sucker for shooters with sexy movement mechanics
that is the plan
im glad someone gets to achieve dwarf
dope
alpplying hammer to face is a good time tho
my comp can't handle it :/
ye
closed beta access to vermintide 2

ZKADD-68JIP-0Y6MJ
parsa
thursday
true
it’d have been fine if eric didnt add me to call like a dickhead
its no longer my fault
i said start w/o me 6 times last night
lul
idk
is the best usage of shitty japanese characters ive ever seen
that extra thicc thing
fair
thanks my guy
i'm officially out.
as this is the third time this dumb shit has happened in two weeks
but nobody answered. 
figured i'd try calling and talking in person
actually fuck it.
so im assuming that's what he meant
he said "i was down to try mars dming"
im taking him at his word
i think its literally that he doesn't want eric to dm
lol
nothing will happen.
ok no opinion equals no
(y)
(y)
wait that's not the input
but is that a yes or a no?
alright
need a unanimous agreement before i do that.
alright should i just be a chad and take the session?
parsa's just making a suggestion and we're waiting for eric to say something more than ouch
nothing is happening
gotchyu
no
just don't be a cunt and metagame your own sessions
eh nah i like the idea of them staying around
or you do
and im assuming while dming somone else controls your pc?
then the next bozo does their plan
so we're talking about two completely seperate incidents
we weren't finding a kidnapped girl in any mountains that was never a thing
but
that's true
8
it took
you remember how many sessions it took you guys to find a kidnapped girl?
who the fuck completes an arc in 2 sessions?
yeah
or would it be seperate campaigns
would we all be in the same world?
as in anyone who wants to takes a week dming
maximum cancer material
just
always within 15 minutes of the game starting
has been spot on every single time
your timing on these cancellations
ngl milo dawg
yuh
oh ok
when is your test tomorrow?
it would probably cause eric to “combust” though
we could and we can
he’s dming.
no.
l m a o
i don’t know
he fuckin might
i don’t wanna deal with that shit
on god if he gets set off again by a delay im out
kid’s kind of annoying 
should be organic
all he needed to do was start the session
ofc i do wtf you think this is?
he told us like 10 different things that would explicitly make us not care before the session ever started
again
lemme link you this shit parsa
then lets not do anything
well
you ask the players what they don’t want to see
in general you call that a session 0
the problem is that he worked 20 hours on stuff without wondering on what we might be interested in playing 
idgaf about blame
he did
gimme 2 hours and i can run a preview game for if anyone wants to join a game where i actually try to make it good
aight
three different times last night
but he also just changed his mind like
the thing was real
ok i’ll try and copy it for you
did you read it?
if i do
i haven’t checked if i still have it
idk
theres a difference
but you let the tracks open up
yeah
and also can’t expect players to be invested in railroady bullshit
or to start on time every time
can’t expect everything to always line up perfectly
lmao
i personally think it started with the impromptu rodondo beach trip
we were all in call
a massive bitch yesterday 
cause eric was kinda being
i thought it came off as it doesn’t matter cause we rescheduled for sunday
i don’t really want to play this “town” “simulator” game with collin in it
ngl
shouldn’t have been enough to kick you over still
yeah thought so
wait ofc you can switch characters after yours dies thats dumb
was that you asking for a second character sheet?
but like didn’t you already plan to switch after alain died?
yeah he fucking babyraged over it
but i’ll probably drop
when you asked to change characters
so first i wanna hear what you said to him yesterday parsa
i told parsa that i’d drop if he got kicked over some stupid shit
but yeah
yup
i think you fuck it up once you try to make it into anything as a dm
hes gotta make it fun
isn’t fun
the game
yeah i feel
alright
lol
you gotta make a game that the players are invested in or find a group that’s interested in all your shitty plant and animal handouts 
you can’t demand that shit thats not how it works
goddammit he begged for player investment
kms
alright
this is the opposite of what i told him to do
why would i ever be so stupid as to engage in conversation with eric to try and fix things
im gonna shoot myself
alright
FUCKING NO
FUCK
ok now im gonna go to bed
whenever that's done.
but session sunday
where what who
fuck the whys idc about that
where are you from, what did you leave behind.
i need to know 2 things from your backstory
also all of your backstories suck except miles'
also parsa you can't switch until you die.
at some point
and then after that i want you to tell me one thing you want your pc to do in this game
assuming we won the big gay final fight eric was planning
i want you guys to tell me one on one what happened to your pcs from last campaign
first and most importantly
round these parts
theres gonna be some changes
now that im dm
ok niggers
its good
sick
lul
and we're gonna tilt him in the game
he's already tilted
i don't particularly want to deal with a triple tilted eric
not posting this in a chat with eric cause i know he'll get tilted
and im in the credits
but he made a game
i had to go and double check with uti
for the wait
for the wait
lul
join the got gud club
yes
it should be the opposite
idfk
maybe it's helpful
so
isshin
i literally didn't learn that until like
if you hold block you get your posture back faster btw
3 hours
you didn't answer forrrr
i just asked a dam question
and claim thats the way shit be
it's more fun to instantly jump to the least likely possible scenario
also Milo Amoore abyss watchers are easy
or just be a man and use what you get
if you're that worried about it
and then continue on with the game
just spend like 6 hours farming embers
that's retarded
why would
esp with mikiri
idk sekiro's way easier than dark souls
unless you didn't get mikiri counter. milo, are you retarded and did you not get mikiri counter?
ez pz
and step on your enemy
aside from that watch for the startups on sweeps and thrusts
that's the souls way
bruh you don't react. just learn attack patterns
*moves
so long as you're next to them they won't use their gay  ranged moes
and do that
what you do is run up right next to them
ez
just mash that block button like it's potatoes.
is why i ask
i didn't learn till genichiro
have you learned the method to consistently parry yet?
have fun with them
we have 3 guards with no connection to the town whatsoever
so
on the boat as a resource
eric let me bring guards from the mainland
btw
its the other two who are elves
oh right, she is
she's human?
bet he will
bet she didn't
yuh
we can take her
yeah we do i guess, i just think killing her before we get to use her kinda makes us retarded
or that guard cunt let the old mayor die
or the hunter was being a thot
like they were antagonizing us first
as much as i like killing eric's named npcs i want to come up with a reason for it
but nah
like if she was more powerful, she woulda just killed dundee in her room
she's just a conniving thot
nor does she have a shitton of connections
a powerful character
i can tell you that she isn't like
so i assume that if i were to tell you more than the vaguest suggestions of what i have heard and have found out i think it'd be less fun
personally i hate the idea of knowing what's going to happen before it happens
and i want to fuck up eric's plans
i want this to be fun for us
i want two things out of this
stop bein a pussy
idk
well
i want the xp
if there is a trap in the grove
also
ngl
i want guacamole
i mean
in which case we call him on his bullshit
unless he does
eh i doubt she'd do something so godless as use gnolls to betray us
mayor and his cabinet
oh
but not to yourselves
considering you tied her up and made her swear to the mayor on her god
i honestly think she only has a problem with you two
idk
i can't tell you
dundee's dead
during watch or something
well then you've gotta kill her
lul
but what is she ognna do?
true
or as soon as she does anything
kill her at the end of the session
see if she does anything
lets wait a bit
vro
you get more hp
didn’t you level up
huh?
ya boi rly cant count
man
wait 30+
big pog
and so long as we keep killing big important characters there won't be one
that's because there really isn't a story yet
*reasonable sleep range
but as is she has like +60 and that's way beyond sleep range
what i can do is cast sleep on her once you guys get her down to like half health
but sounds dank
i don't have anything to crit with
maybe hear her out first though
kill her
but uh
i won't metagame and tell you why
definitely kill her
we turn this island into new mother russia
communism.
what would eric not agree to?
yeah
it relies on the hunter bitch
like we gotta play to his rules, but utterly ruin everything we touch
cause if we just murderhobo for no reason, then we're shitty players. and the point is to not leave eric with someone to blame for his plans falling apart
so more important than just killing the hunter, we need a reason to do it.
that doesn't mean follow his script or give a fuck about his penalty game or whatever, we just can't wreck house while not playing the actual game
while remaining in character as much as possible
and fuck up the game
im thinking we've got to do all this shit
here's the thing
rip his script to shreds
agreed
there is a mystery plot that eric is setting up
i learned some things while dying as dundee ngl
it's a decent plan
yikers dawg we gotta kill your character so you can reroll
oh
actually not true since the stat cap is 16
true
plz do right by your boys and funnel us poor level 1s some last hits next session
well regardless 
are we pretending eric isn’t whipped?
so when you’re done investigating people, make sure to give them to me so i can turn them into alchemical reagents
especially considering the extended situation we find ourselves in
if you haven’t watched it by now you’re probably not going to
and mine ores
but they can tend fields
corpses don’t need to eat
is it?
you gotta step your game up parsa
and i got 2
literally just one
for... potions.
is that not his normal gf?
yep
arentian tiefling guy
me arentian
aint vurcurian
genichiro, please im the one good one
xd
im a tiefling
no
yes.
penny 2: more heinous bullshit
ok my next character is done
in a good way
single parsa character
every
lmao
i need one of them
save dundee's guns as trophies
@milo oi
store em in salt xd
blame me for the mine
blame me for the mine
blame me for the mine
for fastest character death
ngl i'm trying to beat my record
i been done telling you all what im gonna do for two weeks
lul
and that'd be a fuckin great meme
probably
im with it
yeah
but i've still gotta try
i think that's very possible
came up with an in character reason for it too
and leave him alive
the first thing im gonna do once we're free to do anything is bite off both of guardsman paul's arms
use this as the picture xd
next pc
maybe on another playthrough i'd try that out
but i kinda like base shark a lot
i guess nice
fucking  sick
does the mod add their hearts as an item?
meitou and edgewalker is the goodshit
yeah
what did he have?
kms
hahaha
and everyone else is at 10
so now im at 8 honor
he removed it from the sheet
i just want 8 honor for the meme
i don't really care
sounds mega dumb to me
i can't add my proficiency to my honor
if you have bad charisma you probably have it for a reason
ech
from the gay honor score
he's just gonna dock me 2 points
i know
gimme that 8 honor baby
too powerful you mean.
still, im not a huge fan of adding extra bullshit for no good reason
which means you have less time to move i guess.
it's just that in the case of a stun or something, you'd have to do fuck them up in the same round that the stun was cast
i guess it's pretty much the same with the chunks
actually
eric doesn't do flanking so that doesn't really matter
either way, my problem is that it ruins the action economy of certain spells
yeah
its really dependant on whether the enemies get to do it too
yes
since that literally just breaks combat
the real issue is the rule that people who aren’t on the same initiative can move at the same time
i mean i don’t mind that 10 seconds shit when used in certain scenarios 
perfect
my only contingent is that i want him alive while i eat him.
this is a great plan
that's kinda dank
so milo killed him
oh
but i dont think it was that
yeah i don't remember what he said
can't forcefeed us a story if all the gay characters you've made are dead
YUP
im only going after his named characters
im not gonna eat any farmers
which
especially when i talk about eating the farmers
by eating someone
well i'll test the waters.
what our honor is?
and everyone instantly know
you think he'll just have it be arbitrary?
you just gotta not get caught
i don't
do we care?
here's the question
lul
ever since his first campaign with the swords and turning my fucking psion pc into a gay sword wielding douchebag and then a woman
gl
please don't do that.
in the slightest
not at all
kms
this is gonna become a thing, isn't it.
there it is, on paper
got him to admit it
but 
oh
hehe
to Cuntee to Cunte To Cunt
we hit him from all angles
but i like this
you gotta be sneaky, i want to die
then forcing eric's hand is probably not the best idea
hmm
oh
we build another one with our next characters and do it again
and when he makes the raft crash and we all die
and leave the fucking island
and we hop on it
we build a raft in the middle of his quest lines
then we go and eat one of his named pc's for dinner
we'll take them and drop them in the fucking ocean and shit on his story beats
in fact we won't even touch those crystals
we won't do that
now and this plan is fucking massive brain
cause it suits the story
and then we all down it at the same time
then give them to us all at once whenever he decides he wants to
as far as the crystal shit goes, i'm almost 100% sure that he's going to wait on that
um
channeld as much fire and vitriol as i could for ya
even insulted her in your compliments of her
yeah you really put her down
that's a good fuckign question
i
you cussed out the half-orc for 20 straight minutes and then disappeared on everyone while they weren't watching
i eat it to get more stats
eric's thing?
at what?
i can add you back if you want to keep doing that don't rly matter
i don't even look at that shit
did they post pretty pictures?
oh
i didn't want you getting spammed with @ notifications
parsa by the way i gave your kael a good send off today
xd
cause he already put a ton of effort in and feels like he did his job
and then none in when we do ask
and then gets upset that we aren't as invested as him
he invests like 3 days worth of time and writes thousands of words on some shit nobody really cares all that much about
i figured this would end up happening
he did the same thing with daggercourt
remember?
when that started
i mean
tone
i thought it would be a continuation, but maybe he means a seperate thing in terms of
well he said we'd literally spend the first like 5 levels fucking around and then shit would change
this is war. us against his world. we band together to fucking airstrike his story's rails at every goddamn opportunity we can get
for the express purpose of fucking that up
it took him 6 minutes to write what the fuck, i think you broke him
lol parsa im pretty sure you fixed it
i don't give a single fuck i make my own fun
im literally just going to eat his npcs
listen he's been trying to jostle my crocodile with fucking guns into being the nature guy for two weeks
huh
do you care?
who cares
idk
not the vague as fuck version that could mean literally anything that i suggested
you gave the super explicit version of what i said
oh no
just say like, "oh ok well i guess i didn't know"
if you say something it gets worse
no.
he's been pulling this shit
but he's never been able to get us to shut up and not break things with 100% efficiency
that's essentially what eric's been doing the entire time he's been a dm
uh
?
you're not wrong
ok
uh
orrrr we don't, in which case i'll just move on and do other more fun things.
i thought that's why this second player chat was created
this is an eric meme dream campaign, we come second fiddle to that.
what the fuck did you expect?
Umlo's Zone
(ok)
nobody ever doubted that
ok
paladin?
don't want them casting no spells
cut off both of their hands
you sons of bitches, im in
fucking omegalul
we just bag them and put them in labor camps?
so every elf that shows up
lmfao
i mean you're level 10 so it makes sense for you to have picked that shit up
hell yeah
ok
can he speak common?
that sounds fucking sick
i want grog and hashinsh in my eberron
fuck it dog
this is the perfect background.
what the fuck exactly about this do you need to confirm?
lol
what
oh fuck.
holy nation attacks are really fucking up my base lmao. shouldn't have tried to siege stack.
sadniel unstoppable 
lmao
did you have to enslave him?
gat damn 100 in every stat?
wo didn’t see that
never heard a more convincing argument to play league in my life
sure
1 game
no league
oh god no
oh
tf how
*ninja guard
beep completed his martial arts training and managed to punch a guards legs off.
maybe have beep guard that little entrance just in case they get through
ez glap
cause the ai always just takes the shortest straightest route
gonna put a wall or fence or smth around the pool, leave one open space for enemies to try to swim to
fucking gate goes right into the center lake, so all attackers, should they survive the first onslaught while trying to get in, get fucking pelted with bolts and harpoons while trying to swim into my base
unbeatable
came up with the fucking best defense plan
base
ay
also beep is fucking hilarious
take on the entire holy nation alone
bet you become a fucking one man army
now i'm running around exploring and recruiting people. It looks like once you get your combat skills into like the 40s-50s you become a fucking monster, so i wanna find out what happens when you take it to 100
is a very good game
kenshi
started an okran slave, got my shit kicked in, started a revolution and sent half of my slave compatriots to their deaths, escaped to hub, carried rocks in a backpack like a chump for six hours and then got my shit kicked in some more untill i could 1v9 packs of bandits

YISUN IS THE ONE TRUE GOD AND THE CONSUMMATE SUM OF ALL REALITY.YISUN is all things, every thought and every mind, every death and act of violence. YISUN is the weakest thing there is and the smallest crawling thing, and the worm upon the earth and in the earth. YISUN knows all the universal songs and wields the transcendental powers of all reality, and burns in infinite fractal fire.YISUN is infinite, and with no equal, his existence was purely circular. It was a wretched, momentary existence, with infinite knowledge and nothing to share it with. So God rejected singularity and circular existence, and committed the first division: division of Self, Infinite, holy suicide. Upon the moment of his holy suicide, YISUN spoke the Seven Syllables of Roaylty in the language of the universe. These words would echo across the shapeless shapes of existence and never be heard by any. YS ATUN VRAMA PRESH  YISUN said: let there not be a genesis, for beginnings are false and I am a consummate liar.The full of it is this: the circular suicide of God is is the perfection of matter.YISUN lied once and said he had nine hundred and ninety nine thousand names. This is true, but it is also a barefaced lie. The true name of God is I.Living is an exercise of violence. Exercise of violence is the fate of living.Violence is circular. Perception is not circular and lacks flawlessness – therefore, rejoice in imperfect things, for their rareness is not lacking.Love of self is the true exercise of the God called I.Only a fool cannot place his absolute certainty in paradoxes. The divine suicide is a perfect paradox. A man cannot exist without paradox – that is the full of it.YISUN then destroyed himself to create the dual deities: YIS, the black flame, goddess of all that is, and UN the white flame, god of all that is not.These two beings saw each other and were shocked, for though they wielded an infinite art, they were separate. They were so horrified by one another, that they warred for seven years. Then they made love for seven hours. From their second division were born 777,777 gods in black and white, the multiplicity. These gods erected a tower in the void-heart of the universe from which they ruled and warred for eons. Constructing marvels of the arts across the expanse of space. When eventually they grew tired of infinity, they left their tower and each created an order of inheritors to sustain and bear witness to their mightiest works. They each picked a spot, gazing upon their most precious creations, curled into a ball, and whispered a song.Those 777,777 songs ignited the flames within them, arced across the vast expanse of space, burning shut the door to the tower of The Many, then back, and imbuing their inheritors with the hot fire of life.During this time, YIS gave birth to the hungry Black Flame in the void lands at the edge of the universe, and UN breathed his fire into the pure White Flame to watch over the inheritors and keep the peace.And the heavens grew silent.

“Nothing did.” Set says.
“I just tried to throw my arms up but I don’t think anything happened.”
“...”
“I’d be a bit later than that.”
“‘Kay. Two, coming late is fine. Most people won’t be coming until six, anyway.”
“‘Kay. Two, coming late is fine. Most people won’t be coming until six, anyway.”
“Alright.” Set says with a touch of humor in her voice.
“Is this an official invitation?” Set asks. “I have one more client after this, but I suppose I could squeeze it into my schedule. I’ll probably miss the first hour or two.”
“Is this an official invitation?” Set asks. “I have one more client after this, but I suppose I could squeeze it into my schedule. I’ll probably miss the first hour or two.”
“I’m holding you to that.”
“I’ll play nice.”
“On her birthday?”
“I can probably ignore Jannessen for a night.”
It takes a moment for set to respond. When she does her voice is on the other side of Mars’ head.
“One, you were already unofficially invited, but since I’m on grill duty, I get executive invitation power. Just please don’t start shit with Jan, I know you hate each other.”
“Save it for next session. For now just worry about cutting me open. We do have a pool party to get to later.” 
“As your therapist I feel like I’m supposed to argue against that.” 
Set doesn’t reply immediately, so Mars continues. “I don’t have the control, and even if I did, It’s clear that goes right out the window once I’m unconscious. There’s been multiple incidents since that first one, so even I’d make the suggestion to keep me awake. Seriously.”
“You’ve already said that. Don’t worry about it, I know my fuckin oxium, I don’t want to risk anything either.”
“I’m sorry I can’t put you under for this.”
“Cool.”
“Good, then everything is working as intended.”
“I feel that. Top of the neck.”
“I hope not,” Set’s gloved fingers touch the nape of Mars’ neck.
“I hope not,” Set’s gloved fingers touch the nape of Mars’ neck.
“Nothing. Do you think people use this shit recreationally?”
“I just pinched you. Nothing?”
Mars breathes through the hole in the head rest portion of the table. He was staring at the floor for a while, but it became less boring to just keep his eyes closed.
“Cause I wouldn’t know, yknow. At all, I can’t feel a thing.”
“Very funny. No.”
“Fine, I guess, at least as fine as a fuckin disembodied head can feel. You’re not taking my legs off, right?”
“How are you feeling, Mars?” Set’s voice drifts down from above him.

"But I cannot give you the full suite package for two reasons: first, I can't trust you with unconstrained access to our networks. Not in Awakazi, not in Monad, not in Akashia, Geralhim, or Kezizek. Second, I can't let the types of technology we use for and in that treatment be leaked to outside interests. Interests which both of you qualify as and interests that both of you associate with on a regular basis. It will not happen."

"I will. Rest." Acropos watches her curl into a more comfortable position. Takes in the individual hairs as they fall across her face, the slowing of her breath as she drifts unconscious. Then he turns his eye toward the house and follows his orders.

{ Acropos - 3 }
Inside the longcar, Lady Wolf relaxes her entire body into her seat. She sighs, heavy, "I'm tired, Acropos. Please, just wake me when you see them coming out of their house."
Acropos pulls the coat off of his back plate and walks it over to Lady Wolf. She lifts her arms and allows him to dress her in it. He very quickly smooths out any wrinkles in the fabric around her neck and shoulders with a flat hand. They head out to the car.
"Good." Lady Wolf says warmly. She finishes blacking out the passage, then signs the contract. She slides the contract to the senators and stands from her chair. "Burn that, please, when you're done looking at it. Then pack enough for three days and join me in my car in an hour and a half. I'll take you to with me to Awakazi tonight and we'll complete the reconstruction treatments immediately. Acropos, my coat?"
"However, there is another option along that route. The opal package is only available to members of the circle, and it contains the oxium enhanced implants I know you specifically were hungering for." Lady Wolf flips through the pages until she reaches the outlines their desires for the full suite package, pulls a thick black pen from her purse and draws a straight line through the entire passage as they watch. "Is that satisfactory?"

Lady Wolf flips through the pages until she reaches the outlines their desires for the full suite package, pulls a thick black pen from her purse and draws a straight line through the entire passage as they watch. "Is that satisfactory?"
Slowly, Delique and Zeiat nod their assent. "I believe so," Delique says.
"But-" Delique begins.
She continues, "And, despite knowing all that, I'm going to let you do it. You can have the increased pay, we'll kill your senators, and I'll personally notify you when we've gathered the pearls so you can attend all the celebrations." 
Lady Wolf looks back and forth between the two senators. Neither of them reply right away.
"I shouldn't have to say this. Don't take me for an idiot, you don't live as long as I have without learning a bit about how you people think." Lady Wolf sighs. "This entire situation to you isn't a tragedy, a breach of trust, a mistake, or a setback. It's an opportunity. You currently have a tiny measure of control over me and my organization and you want to use that control to attach yourselves to it. To my vehicle. So you can spread your influence and power amongst different systems and circles."
"You don't care about the dead citizens." Lady Wolf leans back into her chair and folds her arms. "If you did you wouldn't be worried  about those two senators. Certainly not to the point that you'd want them dead. You'd be working with them, steering the narrative in a way that covers your involvement in the incident as best as possible."
"You don't care about the dead citizens." Lady Wolf leans back into her chair and folds her arms. "If you did you wouldn't be worried  about those two senators. Certainly not to the point that you'd want them dead. You'd be working with them, steering the narrative in a way that covers your involvement in the incident as best as possible."
Delique's constant fidgeting slows to a crawl as he listens to Lady Wolf.
"Uh, what exactly makes you say that?" Zeiat says, tense.
"That's not true." Lady Wolf replies.
Delique leans forward and says, "A hundred and twenty two citizens is 'a lot.' The terms are meant to be both recompense and a dissuasion against similar actions."
Lady Wolf touches the papers, takes a breath, "This is asking a lot," she says. 
She makes no gestures, no signals, nothing for him to act off of. So acropos does nothing, he clenches his hands into fists, then unclenches them. He checks the cameras, he is on three of them.
He doesn’t move a fraction toward them, but he stares unwaveringly at Lady Wolf.
He doesn’t move a fraction toward them, but he stares unwaveringly at Lady Wolf.
Acropos turns toward his Lady and the two senators.
Stay there, Acropos. 
Acropos first scans the stack for poisons. Finding none, he begins to read. Lady Wolf watches Delique rise from the table and enter the kitchen, particles waft from there into the room, carrying the scent of the snapper's meat and dissolving fats, citrus and a slightly charred root vegetable, certainly not sweet enough to be carrots, but not starchy enough to be potato. Lady Wolf lifts her elbows onto the table, folds her hands in front of her face and twists the ring on her thumb. An implant in her brain activates, establishing a neural connection to Acropos' internal processor.

Lady Wolf lifts her elbows onto the table, folds her hands in front of her face and twists the ring on her thumb. An implant in her brain activates, establishing a neural connection to Acropos' internal processor.
Acropos steps out from behind the chair. Carefully, he picks up his Lady’s plate. Thin porcelain, it would crack between his fingertips if he put more than the slightest touch of pressure on it. He moves behind the senators and stacks those atop the first, then he takes the left over fish platter in his other hand and heads to the kitchen with the ensemble. He can’t identify an established place to deposit the items, so he places the stack on the counter, in front of a wooden rack of clean cookware and the remains of the dinner is left on the stovetop for the hosts to do with as they please. 
“Acropos,”Lady Wolf says, “please clear the table so the senators and I may talk.”
“Acropos,”Lady Wolf says, “please clear the table so the senators and I may talk.”
Zeiat nods eagerly. Acropos' appreciation for Senator Zeiat increases by .4%
"Fantastic," She replies. "It was delicious. I especially liked how the texture of the peppercorns clashed with that of the fish. The vegetable, I don't know what it is, but it was cooked perfectly."
"What did you think, Lady Wolf, good?" Zeiat asks.
She doesn't pick them back up as the two senators clear their plates.
Acropos watches his lady take a single bite of each article of food, then put her utensils down.
Acropos watches his lady take a single bite of each article of food, then put her utensils down.
With dinner on their plates, they both take their seats and begin. Delique mutters a small blessing, religious. Acropos couldn't make out any specific key words that might help flag down the particular religion. The sounds of Zeiat's knife and fork scraping against the porcelain plate drowned out the words.
"Fucking spectacular, so am I!" Zeiat says. He and Delique enter the dining room carrying a large platter and three table settings. Zeiat sets the platter on the table, the fish's flesh is bright and flushed with color from the addition of the lemon's acids. An oily, peppercorn sauce covers the meat, sinking into the little folds and flaky rivulets that fish offers. As Delique passes out the plates, Zeiat begins carving the fish into serviceable portions.
"I'm finished." She says.
Acropos draws up the feeds of the Zeiat's in-home camera system. There are multiple viewpoints of each room, cameras invisible to the naked eye, and each camera is broadcasting its footage through a scrambled channel to a presumably secure satellite server. If Acropos can't reach it, he highly doubts anyone else can.

If Acropos can't reach it, he highly doubts anyone else can.
She sets it down in front of her with an audible shuffle that causes Zeiat to glance back at her. 
Lady Wolf raises her hand back up and Acropos places the contract into it.
Okay, I've made a decision. Give me the contract. 
Yes. There are likely several contingencies set up for that sort of outcome to this meeting.
... I see.
I understand. Please reconsider. I don't think that harming them here, within their home is a viable option to take. Let me show you the camera feeds.
I don't want to give them the opal either.
I understand. Perhaps they will settle for an opal package. It's unlikely they would have ever heard of it. These two are intrigued by mystery and novelty in equal measure, and the opal package is only distributed among circle members. That would likely also qualify to cover their demand for circle membership.
I'm not giving them the full suite.
Their payment is increasing by 8.91 percent. Negligible, but potentially worth noting. They want you to arrange the assassinations of senators Sha Evereth and Kvalor Khone, preferably made to look like an unfortunate misadventure during a warzone visit in their next campaign venture. They desire a position or a chance to be given a position within the inner circle of Wolves. They require a full suite body reconstruction package each, at no cost to them, and they both wish to be present when we use the pearls to open the gateway.
What does it say? Summarize.
Lady Wolf assents, and Zeiat slides the contract to her. She fits the stack of paper into her hand and lifts it up for Acropos to take. He does so.
Delique nods his head in agreement, then reaches over to a small stack of papers from the corner of the dining room table and draws them in front of him. With a smile, "Well, in effort to save time, we can cut the pleasantries if you'd like. We drafted this addendum to our previous contract, if you want to read through it now, I'll help Zeiat set the table and bring out our dinner."
"Too long." Lady Wolf replies. She takes a breath, tense, measured. Subtle vibrations in her chest, head, and neck indicate irritation or frustration. Acropos is pleased that his original assessment of his Lady's appreciation of the senator's character was accurate within acceptable decimal ranges. Lady Wolf does not suffer liars.
"You must be anxious to get this meeting over with, then," the chair legs drag across the floor as he pulls it out. "How long has it been since you've been back?" Delique sits.
Delique's eyes follow him across the room, the jovial mask drops from his face, but with a heavy blink it comes back. Wide smile, shining eyes, he steps carefully to the seat across from Acropos and his Lady.
Delique's eyes follow him across the room, the jovial mask drops from his face, but with a heavy blink it comes back. Wide smile, shining eyes, he steps carefully to the seat across from Acropos and his Lady.
She takes a seat at the table and glances form 17 at Acropos. Deliberately, Acropos walks across the room to stand directly behind Lady Wolf.
Lady Wolf hums warmly in response.
"Hopefully, though, I'll be heading home after this meeting." Lady Wolf looks at Zeiat.
"I suppose, though, it's nice enough, if you don't mind the sight of Amphiron, and you don't mind being spied on by Monad's AI at every station and checkpoint and public bathroom."
"The gates open for my ships. I suppose that's more than most Pirate Lords receive."
"Will the... er, robot sit as well? I'm uh," Dlique fumbles for words.
"Will the... er, robot sit as well? I'm uh," Dlique fumbles for words.
"I will stand." Acropos says.
Lady Wolf sits, and Acropos follows to stand behind her.
Delique hops into motion from his spot by the wall, he heads to the dinner table and pulls out a chair for Lady Wolf. "Please, though, have a seat, get comfortable!"
Lady Wolf looks past Dlique, toward the open kitchen on the other end of the house. Senator Zeiat is there, by the stove. She calls across the room, "Oh, Wonderful. What have you made for us tonight, Zeiat?"

“Lady Wolf! It’s an honor have you.” Senator Dlique says, all smiles. “Please, come in. Zeiat is just putting the finishing touches on our dinner.”
“Lady Wolf! It’s an honor have you.” Senator Dlique says, all smiles. “Please, come in. Zeiat is just putting the finishing touches on our dinner.”
Acropos quickly scans the interior of the home. Dlique’s home is stark, all hard lines and sharp edges, off-white walls, tile floors that look to be marble or limestone, chairs boxy with metal frames, with a matching pair of  grey-pillowed couches. The two things that break that mold are the dining room table: a lengthy piece of mahogany cut into an overturned U, and the coffee table between the couches: a wide slab of beach wood set atop a dark metal frame.

Dlique responds, "The view from here makes it worthwhile."
Dlique responds, "The view from here makes it worthwhile."
Lady Wolf takes off her overcoat and hands it to Acropos. "I'm well, thank you. The ride here was long. I don't honestly know why you would want to make that trip every day."
Lady Wolf takes a few steps into the house, then repeats herself. "What have you made for us tonight, Zeiat?"
The door does open, and Senator Delique of Phora’s Well greet his lady with smiles that stretch too wide across their face.
The door does open, and Senator Delique of Phora’s Well greet his lady with smiles that stretch too wide across their face.
It would bring joy to comply with such an order.
Acropos stands back while she rings the doorbell. Twelve seconds pass before the door opens. Disrespectful. To afford Lady Wolf the proper amount of respect, the door should have been opened the moment she stepped on the first stone of the walkway. An accompaniment of armed wyrms and attack drones should have filed out to escort her into the premises and then stood at attention outside until the meeting was over. At another time, Acropos might have executed the senator immediately for something like this. A bolt of plasma through the brain would be appropriate, but Lady Wolf might prefer he bludgeon him to death with his hands. 
Acropos offers his hand and she takes it. He pulls her to her feet and closes the door behind her. They walk to the door. The senator’s home is quaint, two stories, possibly eighteen hundred square feet when estimating via map searches and image data. It has a vibrant green lawn and a wide porch with a full view of the Well off in the distance.
He opens the door and Lady Wolf steps out. Her right heel clicks as it hits the cement of the sidewalk. The left heel follows.
The car comes to a stop and Acrops jerks into action. With a deftness that at times, still surprises himself, Acropos opens the car door, swings himself out to the street, and crosses the distance to his lady’s door in two long strides. 
…
Acropos settles in his seat and does as he’s told.
“Good. I’m glad you understand.” Lady Wolf folds her hands in her lap. “That will be all, Acropos. Stand by for further instruction.”
“No. I do not want that. I will make a greater effort to use Etainien’s enhancements with better efficiency.”
“Think of all of Etainien’s hard work reworking and reprogramming your systems so they can interface with ours. You wouldn’t want that to go to waste, do you? She’d be very unhappy.”
Acropos nods once.
Acropos nods once.
“Thank you, Acropos.” Lady Wolf pauses, waiting for a response. When one doesn’t come, she continues. “In the future, we’ll have to get you acclimated to using current-age networks to solve these questions before they arise. It would give you something better to do then playing with that multitool.”
“Twenty three minutes remaining, Madam.” Acropos says.
A search for the senator’s address is similarly muddled with nonsense. Acropos notes the signatures of a few automatic alarms alerting Station’s servers of his activity. He brute forces his way through two firewalls and bypasses three security checks in order to pull up the correct address.

The flood of dummy addresses that are both freely available and relatively difficult to reach is a surprisingly effective tactic. He only found the correct one by cross checking with the route the car took from their ship. Without that frame of reference, he can easily see any organic having an extensively difficult, and extremely frustrating time obtaining useful information on the senator. Acropos’ approval of Senator Dlique rises by .6 percent.
It takes a moment to sift through the hundreds of thousands of layers of useless information to find what he needs, then a quarter of that time to analyze and pinpoint his exact location. Currently spiraling through Highway 26e, eastward and up from Station Central out toward Well Vista: Ring 2, Section G.
Acropos dips his head in a gesture of assent, and sets himself to the task of navigating a broken foreign network for a station map to analyze. 
“Then download the maps you need, think about it, and give me an answer.”
“My mapping systems haven’t been updated to account for this sector yet. I have no frame of reference for-“
“How much longer until we arrive?”
Acropos dips his head. “As you wish.”
“Don’t finish that sentence.” Lady Wolf raises her left hand. “Stop doing those checks so often, it’s distracting. Limit them to once an hour.”
“No.” Acropos says. “But in order to be prepared to-”
“Does your routine involve three checks every hour?” Lady Wolf’s eyes scan over his form. Acropos adjusts his multitools.
Acropos doesn’t reply.
“You just did that fifteen minutes ago, and you did another forty minutes before that.”
“Routine systems check.” He replies.
“What are you doing, Acropos?” Lady Wolf asks.
He cycles through his concealed and unconcealed weapons, emitting a metal whir that draws his lady’s attention.
Acropos runs a third systems diagnostic, redundant, of course, but more worthwhile and less overt than adjusting and re-adjusting his multitools. All systems are functioning normally, though, without his core, energy efficiency is very suboptimal. In order ask his lady for permission to have it back, but that would run against his primary orders: Serve Lady Wolf. Follow out her  every command, unquestioning and without hesitation. 
A piece is out of place. Servant Maw made crucial errors on his mission and his lady must now deal with the consequences of those errors. That is why they are in this low-ceilinged longcar on Phora’s Well, headed to the home of the senator Dlique.
The red eyes of his lady’s mask whip back and forth as she looks out the car’s viewport at the objects they pass. Breathing is slow, measured. His lady’s right hand is resting in her lap while the left taps a steady rhythm on the center console. Tense. Frustrated.
Sentinel Unit 01: Acropos is silent during the ride. 
Sentinel Unit 01: Acropos is silent during the ride. 
The longcar’s ceiling is too low for him, so he has to sit crouched on the far side of the compartment, opposite his lady. His lady is wearing a new fur-collared coat for this meeting, beneath which lies the Alusian silk-pattern dress that had been gifted to her by their new queen, Asseylum. The dress is fitted to trace her slender legs down to the ankle, where the straps of black-gold ahmkara skin heels form cross-wrap around petite feet and bright red polished toenails.

The ship's doors open before it even touches ground, and a white-clad Awakakazi male, his horns bound in grey cloth, steps carefully down. He holds a projector box with two hands. The ship appears empty save for the one man.

Neon already knows what she's looking for. Shorter stubbier weapons, nothing too encumbering, that she can sling or holster under clothing without it being too apparent. A single submachine gun, Neon doesn't know the name or make. A stubby shotgun with two barrels on a hinge. Red practices loading the cartridges, snapping it shut, then opening it to pop the cartridges out. She nods to herself and attaches a holster for it to her belt. She slides the gun into the holster. Lastly, she picks out a longer barreled shotgun with a big sliding pump on it. She looks around a bit for the right ammunition and pockets a few containers of those. Red slings the shotgun over her shoulder, logs the requisitions in the terminal by the door, and the two of them head out.

She catches a wash of complex colors coming from the Kates lights. Resentment, apprehension, confusion, annoyance, regret in rapid succession. That seemed unhealthy. Neon's smile grows a bit wider. Red notices, but kindly doesn't ask. Neon feels the threads running thin, too many separate networks at once. Too much information, any more could be painful. The private connection between herself and red, the open channel for Horror Squad, minus one Artifis, the private line between the Kates that Neon tunes herself out of, a private line to Tobin, and Simon and his buzzing, Neon's spreading herself too thin. They reach the elevator. Neon and Red call it while the rest of the group heads on to the trams.

Within the bubble Neon first sees the lights, hundreds of them, pouring in and out of the edges of Neon's consciousness in little rows. Drivers, passengers, workers, soldiers. The lights come in a multitude of colors and they fluctuate rapidly as they move. The colors are emotions, of course. The oxium in her brain designed itself to be interpreted as efficiently as possible. A relaxed baby blue carries a group of four: two soft pinks, excited or elated, a joyful blue, and an orange, embarrassed, probably the brunt of a joke. Neon watches similar scenes play out within that bubble of awareness, before eventually opening her eyes.

Neon makes her way down the hallway.
Neon's name from Red's mouth always strikes like a shock, from her toes to her brain, this time is no different. She stiffens, visibly, and looks down the hall. When she turns back to narrow her eyes at Red, the door to the firing range is closed. Later. 
Red grins and opens the door. "See you in a little bit, Miz."
Neon nods. &gt;Alright.&lt; Then again. &gt;Alright. You're not mad?&lt; Red shakes her head. &gt;Then I'll go see Vica.&lt;
"I'm not mad." Red says, smiling. "Kate's just uninformed. We'll inform her. It's fine."
Neon sighs.
"She's very upset." Red replies.
Neon looks at Red. &gt;Oh,&lt; She says aloud. &gt;You noticed?&lt;
"And then lunch. And we talk about the Kate situation."
&gt;Okay.&lt; Neon says. &gt;Then I'll be back in a little bit.&lt;
Red smiles, nods. "Shouldn't be too hard."
Neon points to the door across the hall. &gt;Firing range, there. I don't know how to set it up, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.&lt; 
Red takes a quick walk around.
The armory is close to the gym and across from the firing range. They enter.
The elevator doors open at their floor and the two of them walk side by side down the hall.
Nothing is said.
The elevator arrives. They step inside. They head up.
Neon looks over at Red. Red fires back a smug smile. That bitch. Neon's going to ravish her for that later. Later. Later.
Tobin always takes special care not to mention any of her friends names to Neon. Probably best not to bring it up, for now,  but definitely worth remembering. 
Tobin feels a buzz in her back pocket. Her phone. She pulls it out, opens it to the conversation she was having. Not work, apparently. Talking to someone named Tracy. Tracy. Neon recognizes the name. That's interesting. 
Tobin turns toward Neon, right eyebrow raised above the left. They meet eyes. Neon feels the thread between them swell, flush with worthless information. Neon blinks a few times, leans against the wall of the elevator room, then pushes herself through that thread. It takes a moment. Then Neon sees Tobin's view of the back of the group. The two Kates following Boenn. Simon's twitchy ears poking above Kate's head, about level with Boenn's elbow.
As they go on, Neon signals Tobin with a quick, &gt;Turn?&lt;
As they walk, Neon speeds up to fall in step with Red. Red's arm sneaks it's way around Neon's waist, then pulls her in, fingers slipping in between layers of clothes. Neon closes her eyes for a moment and lets herself be pulled along.
They head toward the elevators, where Red and Neon will split off from the rest of the group. Red wanted to take a look at the Horror Squad armory, and Neon needed to have a quick conversation with Vica while Simon wasn't linked to her.
They head onward to their next destination. Simon falls in step behind Neon on his own. That one makes her start to smile.
Audible sighs and nods in response. Boenn, unpracticed, lets slip a, "Took her long enough," which Neon graciously ignores.
Audible sighs and nods in response. Boenn, unpracticed, lets slip a, "Took her long enough," which Neon graciously ignores.
&gt;Okay. That was enough. Thanks.&lt;
It's been ten minutes since she'd had them stop here. About time to move on. Kate's getting fidgety. Talking to herself, with herself. Not sure of the rules regarding that. Is it socially acceptable to hold a conversation with yourself if there are two of you? Does Kate care? Yes.
Next to the second Kate is Boenn, calm grey, bland green, vague interest. Within arm's reach of Boenn is a quivering Simon. Neon doesn't need her oxium to read Simon's fearful stress. That face of his sends happy quivers up Neon's spine that run warm from the base of her neck, down her arms and into her fingertips. For the first time in a week, Neon has relinquished control over Simon's body to him. She had gotten very used to him. So much so that being just Mizerkah today feels off. It was fine though. Sex with Red is awkward when she has another body off in the other room. Red makes it hard to think. Hard to multitask. Red is a very good trainer in that regard. 
Neon turns to her little entourage. Maybe a sort of big entourage, now. Lin-Sho contrasts her dark green focus by standing on the lip of the fence of the overpass, wings tucked in, hunched against the breeze. Tobin, clearly having fun, is off to the side on her phone. Kate, next to Tobin watches, a flare of bright orange, as Neon catches her eye. Another Kate, next to her, watches Red, who is on her own, unreadable, further along the overpass.
That's enough of that. Neon pushes herself away from the railing.
A large eighteen wheeler changes lanes in preparation to get off the highway, forcing two lanes of vehicles to hit their breaks.  Neon watches the wave of colors that runs through the people in their vehicles. First, a flash of alarm, then agitation as they slow, brief anger, annoyance, as they get moving again, then seconds later, it's gone. Completely forgotten. Neon thinks it shows how little life matters to these lights. They don't take the half second it takes to process the events that lead to them having to slow down on the freeway. They don't think about the eighteen wheeler. They see the person in front of them slow, throw a tantrum while they slow themselves, then move on. Moment ended. Sickening.
The lights of all the people on Highway 2A shine through the roofs of their trucks. Where Neon looks, she can see the thin threads that reach up from the lights toward her own head, not quite connecting, still waiting for the gap to be bridged. She can see the tentative beginnings of threads between those lights; the promise of the network she could form were she able to get her foot through that first door.
She pictures the bubble around her head. It's small, a foot across at most, but Neon pushes it outward. The bubble expands until it reaches the Highway below, the hallways hidden in the ceiling above and in the walls to the sides. She pushes until it won't expand further, until the stress screams out and pulls the bubble back. Prey instinct. Fear keeping her mind from breaking itself.
She squeezes her eyes shut. Closing her eyes makes it easier to picture everything. 
There are a lot of them, though. Neon likes overpass C-11 over Highway 2A because it's busy, which makes it a good place to practice with her oxium.
The trucks and vans are bland, in bland colors, Marche Slave green, grey, black, white.
Neon leans over the edge of the overpass, and watches trucks stream down Highway 2A.

That taken care of, Maw grips the previously named: far-left girl and pulls her by the waist till she squishes up against his side. Her hands instantly go for the mandibles. Girl’s got balls, Maw likes that sort of thing. Far-right girl seems to be a little frustrated with the lack of attention. Maw makes eye contact and nods her over.

Maw lets the girls talk at him with their coo-ing “fuck me” voices while they feel up his arms and legs. He doesn’t mind it. Especially not when the fish chick to his left can’t keep her fins from grabbing his dick every three seconds. Slut. She’s asked four times if she could suck his dick for another tab of acid. She’s not getting any, of course, but she’ll end up sucking his dick anyway. Happens every time.

The Maw is sitting in a booth on the third floor of the White Cavea. It’s his favorite of Lady Wolf’s many clubs on Awakazi. Probably because the third floor belongs almost exclusively to The Maw. Well, the Maw and all his girls. And there’s always a fucking lot of girls, always new ones; that’s important. It gets on his nerves when the meat ain’t fresh.

Maw throws an arm over his eyes and imagines it’s Lady Wolf under the table while he repeats and re-repeats that conversation in his head.
He feels a pair of hands fumbling with his belt buckle.
Maw sits back into his chair. He closes his eyes, lets his head drop backward and sighs.
Acropos opens the door as Lady wolf approaches it, and she follows him out. 
“Okay.” Maw says.
“Okay.” Maw says.
“Don’t bother. That was all, Maw. Acropos and I will leave you to it. Take care.”
“I’ll-”
“I sincerely hope you do.” Lady Wolf nods. She stands from her chair. “Your, ah, friend there is crawling under the table.” 
“I understand.” Maw says.
“I know what you’re thinking, ‘Oh no, what in the almighty fuck is going to happen to me?’ Right?” Lady Wolf asks, her voice is cool, soothing almost. Maw feels a weight begin to lift off his shoulders before she even begins to continue. “For now, you need to try not to worry. Compensation has been handled, and the next meeting with the ambassadors isn’t for another month. So you have exactly that much time to find the pearl, wherever it may be and take it, however you must. Just so long as you try your absolute hardest not to cause a scene.”

“It’s incredibly important that you keep this reasonably discreet. The last thing you need is people paying asking why you’re doing what you’re doing.”
“Okay.” Maw nods. 
Maw notices how hard he’s clenching his hands. He un-clasps his hands and rubs his face with one of them.
“Ah, terrorizing the hostages, what a quaint way to put it.” Lady Wolf lets go of the sphere and leans back. “Eating hostages! You ate a hundred and twenty-two residents of Phora’s Well. And now, not only do I have to compensate them for that and provide some means of securing the standings of the kind ambassadors who had partnered with us in this endeavor, but now I need to also explain to them that you didn’t manage to retrieve the pearl and all those deaths and all that damage served no purpose whatsoever.” 
“I… Was terrorizing the hostages. For fun.”
Lady Wolf sighs. “No you weren’t, they were running away.”
“I was fighting off bounty hunters that happened to be on scene.” Maw says, the words are dry in his mouth.
“Well? What was it you were doing? I’d like to know.” Lady Wolf rolls the fake pearl toward her, then away, then in a slow circle.
Maw doesn’t respond.
“It must have been very important, what you were doing, in order for you delegate this one, incredibly important, incredibly simple task of yours to a foot soldier who happened to be nearby. Was it not?” Lady wolf hasn’t moved an inch.
“Uh.” Maw frowns harder.
“Of course, Maw. It wasn’t that. You were simply too preoccupied to double check before making your escape.”
“No, definitely no- certainly not. I just.”
“I believe I did. Unless my memory is failing me. Do you want to tell me that my memory is failing me, Maw? Is that why you failed your task and brought me a fake pearl?”
“No, fucking... But...”
“It is. It’s a good fake, to the untrained eye, but I’m fairly sure I taught you to be able to tell the difference.”
“No.”
“Really…” Lady Wolf sighs. “You’re half right. It is from Phora’s Well. But this is a fake.”
“Yes.”
“Are you sure?” Lady wolf rolls the ball a hair to the right. “You’re sure that’s what this is?”
Maw frowns. “One of the Ahmkara’s Pearls?” He says, “The one from the Phora’s Well Great Hunt museum?”
The left half of the eyes on her mask twitch. Then she looks over to the side, toward the girl, who’s in the beginning stages of a heavy trip, slumped into her chair. She looks back, “No, but I have one tonight.” Lady Wolf reaches down beside her, then sets a small white sphere on the table in front of her. She keeps her hand on it, to prevent it from rolling. “Do you know what this is?”
Maw shakes his head. “Do you need a reason?”
Lady Wolf watches him for a half-moment, then says, “Do you know why I’m here right now, Maw?”
Maw folds his hands on the table so he doesn’t grip the armrests too hard. “I am.” He nods. “Thank you.”
Lady Wolf waits for him to get settled in. “Well, are you comfortable?” Oh shit.
Maw takes his time settling into his own seat. Lady Wolf respects dignity, self-control. Show any weaknesses and she’ll eat you alive. She’s fucking ruthless like that. Maw would give absolutely anything to fuck her.
She does as she’s told, settling deep into the chair. Good girl.
Maw ignores that, and pulls a silver cigarette case out from his pocket. He pops it open and pulls out a tab. Carefully, Maw coaxes fish girl into opening her mouth and he sets the tab onto her outstretched tongue. “Now close those pretty eyes and lean back,” Maw says.
“Really?” Lady Wolf watches Maw position a chair for fish girl in the corner.
The robot is standing guard in front of the door. When Maw nears, the robot steps aside and pushes the door open for him to step through.
The fish girl grins wide. She does a good job of hiding it from the others. Takes Maw’s outstretched hand and lets him lead her around the outside of the crowd toward the conference room. On the way there he stuffs his dick back into his pants, just to make sure he looks presentable for the Lady.
Maw frowns. “Ladies,” He says, “I just found out that I’ve got some business to take care of.” Maw moves the table out of the way, climbs out of the seat, and helps fish girl to her feet. “Now, you know what I’d really love, is if you all could wait here till I get back and keep each other company. I won’t be gone for long.” He pushes the table back in place and takes a few steps backward, leaving his shirt behind. He points to them in the booth. “Don’t go anywhere.” Then, fuck it, Maw motions to fish girl, “Except you, sweetheart, you follow me.”
She stops, says, “huh?” Looking up terrified at him. Good reaction, Christ. That shit gets Maw hard in a heartbeat. 
Maw reaches under the table and squeezes fish girl’s shoulder, “Hey.” 
Son of a fucking bitch. The fish gives a decent blowjob, too.
He sees Lady wolf and her pet fucking robot. Son of a bitch. They meet eyes. He watches the slow tilt of her head. The back room, that means. The robot being here means, Now. 
The elevator chimes, grabbing Maw’s attention, he’d told the doorman not to let anyone else up. He glances over the heads of the crowd to get a look.
The fish girl is really into it, stroking Maw’s chest and licking and sucking on his neck. She’s ready for some direction. Maw takes his hand off a wonderfully silky thigh to take the fish by her shoulders and guide her under the table. He gives her a pat on the head and lets her get to work.
The music changes. Before it was some sort of loud whiny techno shit that was making his girls take all their clothes off, now it’s a bit quieter, deeper tones. The girls don’t notice, yet, with all the drugs in their systems, how could they? But the dancing is slowing down, less quick flashes of sweaty tits and shiny asses. Not hot. Maw wants to go down there and rip that DJ’s head off for fucking with his music. Nobody fucks with the mood in his club without asking first. That retard should know better. He’d do it right now if it weren’t for the hands on his dick. 
Fresh girls, fresh skin, raw, warm, there are four or six girls in his booth with him. He doesn’t know whether to count the pair on the left end cause they’ve been fucking one another for the past ten minutes and are all but dead to the world by now. Four at his booth, perfect skin, all of them. He’s very particular about the skin. It has to be silky smooth and blemish free. Untouched, unmarked, blank slates, nothing kills an appetite like scars. The girls at his booth have perfect skin. He rubs his right hand down a warm spine, squeezes an ass that feels like warm butter in his hands. Almost enough to make a man drool.

I don’t even feel the ship land. Even lacking dedicated hands, Tashen is an incredible pilot. His neck cranes to face us all and in his quiet, even voice he says, “Alright, we’ve arrived. I’m opening the doors.” Lady Wolf stands first, smoothing out her dress with her hands. Then Etainien rises to her feet, giving me access to scoot myself out of the booth. Tashen opens the doors. A rush of cold air fills the one-room lander. A small walkway descends from the ship to the grassy earth below and Lady Wolf takes the first step outside. Lord Wolf pulls himself out of the copilot’s seat while Tashen goes through a check of the ships systems and begins the shutdown process. Etainien, now outside as well, stretches, her skirt of tail feathers flutter and flex in the breeze. I stand a little stiffer with my hands clasped behind my back when Lord Wolf steps down off the pilot’s platform and into the main cabin. His eyes fly straight past me, though. Instead, outside, to Etainien and his Lady. He follows them out.
As the three outside acclimate themselves to solid ground I stop in the door to check on Tashen. He moves slowly, in practiced motions around all the ships controls. Most ships are designed for bipedal pilots. The layout forces Tashen to take awkward positions. He gingerly dips his head to avoid catching his antlers on a panel filled with dials and levers on the ceiling. Then he rolls to the side to bend his knees under the handles. He notices me watching.
“Don’t worry about me,” He says. “I’ll follow you out in a moment.” 
“Oh, okay,” I nod. “Is it always this hard to get in and out?” I ask, still standing in the doorway.
“In everything but my fighter, yes. It’s why I don’t pilot very often, too much inconvenience.”
I look outside for a moment. Etainien is fiddling with some of her instruments, taking scans and measurements while Lord and Lady Wolf talk a little ways up toward the rocks. We landed in the same clearing that Sirie did the last time I was on Crotia. How long ago was that? A month? “That sounds hard.” I say.
Tashen steps one hind leg out of the seat and onto the floor, then slowly pulls the other after it. “It is,” he says, “But only because I enjoy piloting so much.” He gets his other leg out as well and steps down into the main cabin. “The Lord Wolf had my fighter custom made for me after he chose me for the inner circle. The fit is effortless, and it controls like a dream.” I make my way out outside and he follows.
“He chose you?”
“Yes, I suppose we have that in common. But I’m both his first mate and his fleet admiral. I don’t go out of my way to search for proteges.”
“And thats why you weren’t at the introduction ceremony thing?”
Tashen dips his head. “You’re not forced to attend unless you’re inducting someone. If I absolutely had to go, I’d probably choose Idrethal’s pilot, Rinsler, but I don’t think that would sit well with him.
“Right, that makes sense.”
We make our way to the others. Etainien finishes with whatever she’s been working on, and joins us on our way to the cave entrance, already opened. Lord and Lady wolf are inside; we follow them.
The path is straightforward compared to last time, something about the oxium levels dispersing, and causality shifting back to normal. I don’t really pay attention to what Etainien says after the first thirty seconds. With her droning on and the facility’s AI voice thing only acknowledging Lady Wolf’s presence, the even textured metal walls and floors their evenly spaced lights and long, straight hallways it’s incredibly easy to get lost in thought.
A month. Maybe less since I was here. With Shanta and Sirie and the others. I handled those relationships terribly. How many times did I disappear on them? I’m not too sure. I don’t think I can get away with it anymore. Not this time, at least. No coming back and getting a warm hug and a breakfast full of pancakes. Fuck.
And that’s without mentioning Sirie. Or Mars. Or Uti. Or Faye. I don’t know how any of them are doing. I don’t know anything. I’m alone. I did this. But I don’t even know how? I’ve never really been one to make decisions. I think I’ve always sort of just let things happen to me. And as soon as I get sick of that and start doing things myself, I fuck everything up. I’m a fucking mess. I don’t even deserve them anyway. Of course I don’t. I’m here. This is where I belong. Where I’m meant to be.
…At least I can be sure I’m working toward something good. Lady Wolf’s been nothing but truthful to me. I’m glad for that. It’s like… The one thing I’ve been missing, that I’ve really needed all my life. Everyone lies to me. All the time, one lie after another. First Sirie, then Faye, Mars constantly, Shanta, Kisket, Luden, Yvelte. I can count the people who haven’t on one hand. Lady Wolf. Carnix. Veritable. I don’t get how telling the truth makes you “evil.” Everyone hated Carnix. Most people still hate Lady Wolf. And nobody even pretends to like Veritable. Not even the people he works with. What’s the fucking point?
What’s the fucking point.
Etainien seemed to have shut up eventually after she got bored of my humming and nodding. We’re at that door again. The big one that Sirie tried to stop us from going through. Lord Wolf pushes it open. The honey-gold light from within spreads across the damp hallway, reflecting in the pools beneath our feet like fire on stone. Inside, the room has been reconstructed, or maybe replaced with something that looks a bit like a nursery. I guess. If that nursery had belonged to a trillionaire. 
A crystal chandelier reflects and refracts scattered lights across the room, illuminating scripts of text on a smooth, black, stone wall. The wall is framed by small waterfalls that flow backward up either side of the rock. The trickling sound of water bounced off the corners and ceiling and gave the room an air of unbreakable calm, at least it would have had we not entered all at once, armed, armored, weapons primed, save for Lady Wolf, with her hands clasped pleasantly in front of her, with her expressionless mask as blank as always. We all take aim at the woman in the chair in front of us, her back still turned, the gaudy white hair flowing behind her, and onto the floor, with some sort of silk robe draped over her shoulders. 04, The Fool, was what the facility called her. Lady Wolf calls her “Brother.”
“-it’s nice to finally meet you.” Lady Wolf finishes.
The Fool turns in the chair to look at us. Nothing about her changed over the month since the last time I was here, It doesn’t look like she took one step outside of this room. She says, clearly to the room, “Turn off the simulation,” and the light and the stone scenery melts into motes of gold and color into the floor and the walls, out of sight, leaving us at the edge of a cold grey room, and her sitting on a stool in the center of a raised platform.
“You’re 03. You’re the Moon?” The Fool says. In Ahamkara. Her voice is deadpan. She sounds almost angry.
Lady Wolf nods. “Yes.”
“Which face are you?” The Fool asks, “What syllable?”
Lady Wolf frowns, she seems to have a hard time finding a reply.
The Fool waits a moment, then frowns. “Leave. You have nothing to say to me.”
Lord Wolf grips his gun tighter. Lady Wolf lays her hand over his. She pushes the weapon out of the way. “Alright.” Lady Wolf says, “We’ll leave.”
Then we turn back around and head back to the lander. Lady Wolf pulls the mask off her face. Her breaths are ragged and her shoulders shudder. She lets Lord Wolf pull her close and doesn’t say a word. 
{ The Fool - 1 }

I don’t even feel the ship land. Even lacking dedicated hands, Tashen is an incredible pilot. His neck cranes to face us all and in his quiet, even voice he says, “Alright, we’ve arrived. I’m opening the doors.” Lady Wolf stands first, smoothing out her dress with her hands. Then Etainien rises to her feet, giving me access to scoot myself out of the booth. Tashen opens the doors. A rush of cold air fills the one-room lander. A small walkway descends from the ship to the grassy earth below and Lady Wolf takes the first step outside.

She grips the soft fabric of the cloak tightly and hugs it to her chest.

Lastly, Kisket pulls the cloth out from the crate. It’s two toned, dark grey and green. A... Cloak? Are those in style or something? Kisket stares at it for a long moment.

Two boxes sit cushioned within a bundle of cloth. The large box contains three spare cylinders for the gun, because of course, Qitara is too thorough to miss anything. The small box contains four more of those black rings. Kisket will have to figure out what they’re for, eventually.

There isn’t anything particularly special about the revolver’s grip. She sets it down, pushes the foam block aside and checks the bottom of the crate.
Next time, gloves.
Carefully, Kisket uses the metal cap to push the ring back into the gun.
Four tall spires of twirling, twisting shapes pour upwards into the night sky. They give off a light, that melts into the light of the stars and the lights in OUR eyes. The tips of the spires reach up, calling out to the things beyond the edges of perception. Where lines are blurred, where a golden iris peers- Kisket removes her finger. The tip is burned where it touched the ring.
Theres a small lever on the underside of the cylinder which Kisket pulls with the tip of her finger. A thin cap along the top of the gun pops open and a small black ring, that looks like a slice of the gun’s barrel pops out. Kisket touches the ring.
Kisket extracts the pieces of the gun from their foam molds. It’s a revolver. The middle part is a firing cylinder. more of the silver vines circle it in arched rows, like a rib cage. Kisket pops the cylinder open; it looks like it holds seven bullets. The cylinder can be entirely removed from the pin it sits on. She could pre-load the gun if there are any spares in the crate.
Was that wrong? Qitara said she’d appreciated it. But... Kisket looks at the bed. People were trying to kill Veruvi over that sphere thing for several months. Then, suddenly, they weren’t. 
Kis never pushed her too hard for answers, she made assumptions and didn’t bother verifying them. It was much more important for her to be there to support Qitara than it was to know everything about her. 
Kisket frowns. There were times where Qitara would go on missions either alone or with Iri that Qitara tried her hardest not to talk about. Constant deflections or topic changes, short, vague, two to four word answers that didn’t really mean anything.
It looks expensive. Probably way too expensive. Stolen, maybe.

The barrel is made of silvery grey vines that wind and coil around the black barrel. The chamber is dull black with more of the silver-grey ribbing over it

Kisket turns back to the foam block. Left inside is what appears to be a gun, separated into three parts.
She turns away, then quickly turns back and moves the sphere underneath her pillow, the side she doesn’t sleep on, and presses the pillow on top of it, carefully.
Kisket puts it on her, uh, on her bed. That seems like a good place for it.
She picks it up, it’s warm and in the palm of her hand it feels like it’s vibrating, but it’s so soft that Kisket wants to believe its her own imagination, or the trembling of her hand.
Shit.
The first item to catch her eye is a softball-sized white sphere with no identifiable features or blemishes. It’s probably four or five inches across.
Out of the crate she sees that she can pull the top half off, which she does.
Underneath the armor is a thick block of foam, Kisket has to wiggle it loose before she can get it out of the crate. 
Beneath the clothes are a few pieces of lightweight armor plates that could probably fit onto the clothes, all white or light grey, like her usual set of armor.
It’s forest green, long; it would probably come down to her ankles. Beneath that is a pair of gloves, white, like her armor, a sleek shirt made of bands of white metal, like Qitara’s own. A pair of dark grey tights.
She pulls the layer of foam out from the crate. Beneath that is clothing. A coat, specifically. 
Kisket... sets that aside for now.
She waits a bit. Then she gets out of bed and grabs the package. It’s heavy.
She waits a bit. Then she gets out of bed and grabs the package. It’s heavy.
Kisket opens the envelope. Inside is a note, which Kis unfolds. It’s plain white paper with Qitara’s tiny handwriting in blue ink. It says, “Keep it close. I’ll see you again.”
Used to draw them, right. Shit.
Kisket stares at the heart for a while. It’s cute, sort of rounded at the bottom. Qitara draws them on everything she gives to Kisket.
Beneath the lid is a sheet of packaging foam, on top of which is a baby blue envelope labeled Kisket. Kisket’s name is encircled by a large heart.
Kisket opens the clamps and lifts the lid off the crate.
It’s a steel grey industrial crate with two heavy clamps across the lid.
She turns on the lights and sets herself and the box down on the floor.
Kisket listens to Tracy’s footsteps heading away from her door.
“anyway, i’ll leave this here, hopefully nobody takes it before you come out. i’m gonna be in the training room, if you wanna find me. eao’s gonna show me her empty fist something kung-fu stuff.”
“anyway, i’ll leave this here, hopefully nobody takes it before you come out. i’m gonna be in the training room, if you wanna find me. eao’s gonna show me her empty fist something kung-fu stuff.”
“there was a-stop that-a package in qitara’s p.o. box. eao and i opened it up, cause, uh. so 
rry. there’s a letter for you at the top. we didn’t go past that.”
“there was a-stop that-a package in qitara’s p.o. box. eao and i opened it up, cause, uh. so

Kisket pushes herself up to rest on her forearms.
Kisket groans into the pillow.
Another knock, “kisket, you in?” Tracy’s voice is muffled a bit by the door. 
Kisket turns her head to the side to see. Half of her vision is obscured by her pillow. Qitara’s pillow, actually. The long grey one that Kisket had gotten as a gift for her.
There’s a knock on Kisket’s door. 
{ Kisket - 4 }
First, I disconnect from his sensory inputs. The dizziness cuts out. Walking without feeling is difficult, though so I take a tentative step forward. He’s small, but his legs are pretty large in proportion to the rest of them. I make a few horrible, gut-wrenching attempts before I give up on dividing my attention and turn to watch myself, Simon, walk. It helps. I try to dredge up Simon’s natural gait in my head. Nothing. I’ve been thinking too much about other things. Usually I’d remember something important like that.

After a few circles around the chair I decide it’s good enough. I turn him to the door and head through. When the door closes I begin picking up the room. For a moment I think of letting Simon simmer longer, but the buzzing is frantic enough; I don’t need to waste any more time.

Lie. Grabbing at straws, any chance to defy me. This is gonna be so fun.
No.
&gt;Alright, Simon. How does a bath sound? Good?&lt;
Simon reaches Kate’s door. I-Simon knock on it. She opens the door, her eyebrows shoot upward. The reaction I was hoping for, nice. Through Simon, I ask for aspirin and penicillin, then explain why. She rolls her eyes, then goes and finds the pills. She gives them to me. I remember to thank her before I leave.
&gt;Of course.&lt;
I...
I...
&gt;Great one. So. You and Idrethal. Warren... Rinsler? Hm. The Maw, wow okay. Veruvi Salisk. Palanhin Eir. Kaiden Trazch, obviously. Vasha En… And, I suppose everyone who works under those people?&lt;
Red looks at me. I blink. She smiles.
&gt;Hah!&lt;
Monad. Theia.
&gt;Specifically?&lt;
A lot of people.
&gt;You know more than that though. Who works for Lord Wolf?&lt;
&gt;That’s good.&lt; Neon hums as she and Red mop the floor.
It’s a holiday for a good number of bounty hunters. Happens every seven years where they go to Tahl Sfarti and hunt Ahmkara together.
&gt;What do you know about the Great Ahmkara Hunt?&lt;
Simon’s buzzing grows erratic.
&gt;You’re supposed to try to lie. It’s fine. I already know one, I didn’t think there were more...&lt;
I don’t know.
Uh… He’s-
&gt;Yeah. You had a strong reaction to that. You’re gonna have to learn to lie better than that, Simon….  Let’s see, he’s your boss on paper, but more of a mentor, or father figure. What’s he grooming you for?&lt;
I listen as Simon is hit with a wave of insecurity, self-doubt, fear. I hear his subconscious come forward and whisper those doubts to himself and to me.
&gt;You’re attracted to him. That’s easy enough to figure out. He treats you like you’re special, values you.&lt;
He’s-
&gt;And. Heh. Most of them don’t have to do with him being your boss.&lt;
Simon buzzes.
&gt;Good lie! I’m sure you’ve practiced that one, though.&lt;
Idrethal is my boss. We’re bounty hunters. He’s the team leader.
&gt;Who’s Idrethal?&lt;
Yes.
&gt;Are you ready?&lt;
Okay.
&gt;Great! Now! When I ask you something, you’ll try to lie to me in your head. If you don’t say anything, there’s a punishment.  I don’t want to use the punishment. Don’t make me, because I’ll know the answer afterward anyway.&lt;
Yes.
&gt;Good, now are you going to play the game?&lt;
Yes.
&gt;You’re only here, alive, for two reasons. The first is because you have information that I want and that you are going to give to me. The second is because I’ve got a feeling that you might be entertaining. That’ll last you a lot longer than the information will. Do you understand what I’m saying?&lt;

Simon doesn’t respond directly. He’s scared, very angry, confused; he thinks I’m crazy. Delusional, but of course, that’s a reasonable reaction to his situation. Red sweeps the floor while I use a rag to scrub the walls.
&gt;We’re past all that. You were incredibly uncooperative. I told you not to fight from the very beginning but you did, idiot. But listen, I’m forgiving you for all that. We’re moving past it, understand?&lt;
Simon doesn’t respond. He’s apprehensive, doesn’t want to provoke me.
&gt;It’s different. I hate interrogations. It’s a game, friendly. Not. Torture. Ugh.&lt;
&gt;No.&lt; I freeze for a second.
You’re going to interrogate me?
&gt;I’m going to ask you questions, and you’re going to try to lie to me.&lt;
What’s, uh...  What’s the game?
&gt;In the meantime, we’re going to play a friendly game. I’ve got to warn you, I’m really good at it, though.&lt;
Alone, in the cell, I don’t need to suppress my laughter. He doesn’t have a response for me.

Where? Why?
&gt;I’m going to move you for a few hours, Simon.&lt;
I hear simon’s internal buzzing as he continues to ty to keep me out of his head. Almost funny enough to taunt him with, but I don’t bring it up just yet.

&gt;Hey.&lt;
&gt;Hey.&lt;
After an hour I think I have everything under control. My-Mizerkah’s hands pull the locks and straps and ties off my arms and my legs and my throat and mouth. Then, I-Simon push myself out of the chair. I land on my feet, and wobble, much more than expected. My-Simon’s head feels heavy, much heavier than when I was sitting. Bad, I had purposely kept Simon underfed, but I had tried to make sure he wasn’t dehydrated. The dizziness makes me feel dizzy. I wonder if he’s sick. That’d be very bad. Even more reason to clean this room, I guess.
I push the voice out of the way, instead focusing on his senses, checking and re-checking, making sure everything is in order and getting used to his size. It’s not difficult work, but being thorough is important, and that takes time.
I feel my fingers work through my-his toes. The warm water still dripping off my fur, hear the sound of the air flowing through the vents and my hushed breaths and my hushed breaths and my heartbeat throbbing in my chest.

Combing my fingers through his long-nailed toes, I look up at him, catching his eyes as he watches me work.
I move to his back through the gaps in the chair’s backrest, chest, stomach, cautiously skirt around that awful thing between his legs, thighs, shins, calves, and feet.
Eventually I turn to Simon himself. Starting with his head (which makes him jump), I wash his scalp, then his ears, nose, neck, and shoulders. He doesn’t comment, but I didn’t expect him to. 
I ignore him, and he pretends to sleep more.
It takes three hours get rid of that stench. Simon woke up at some point during the second.

I step through the sliding door and am immediately confronted with the smell of shit and old blood. Maybe he’d gone and died on me. Of course he didn’t, though. I can feel the strings of his mind scratching against my fingertips. Asleep then. I decide to wait for him to wake up. And wash the room in the meantime.
I tell people that I, Neon, don’t like torturing people. That’s still true. I, Mizerkah, like torture very much. Too much. Not the act itself, but the results.

Thank fuck Red is here now, otherwise I doubt I’d have had the patience. Between her, Kate, and my regular routine on the ship, I managed to hold back and let Simon simmer.
I, Mizerkah, waited a full fifteen hours before going back into that room with Simon.

Set lightly bobs her head, urging. "Continue."
“I know. I’ve already read the report, though.” Set's taps get a bit louder.
Set taps her pen on her clipboard. She used to take notes for her meetings with Mars, but that didn't prove very useful. Now she just uses it to doodle. Mars likes the sound of the pen scratching on the page. He probably doesn’t realize it, but hearing the sound while he talks de-stresses him instantly. The doodling helps Set, too, not in dealing with stress, but organizing her thoughts.

Simon hears the pair of footsteps walk into the room. The flow of air stops. The door closed. A bead of sweat runs down Simon’s neck.

Simon blinks, and the black is gone. He’s back in his chair in the room. The ropes are back to normal. The blindfold is off. The room is completely bare, save for the tray of cluttered tools that rests in the corner. Simon exhales. He’s tired.
&gt;I’ll see you later, Simon.&lt;
&gt;Fine. Don’t talk. It doesn’t matter anymore, anyway.&lt;
A joyful sigh echoes through Simon’s head. &gt;Finally! I’ve got you. Did you run out of oxium for your fucking annoying power?&lt;
Neon continues speaking. &gt;Back when it was just me and Red, we used this setup pretty often. Not for interrogation, of course. But it’s useful in many areas. For instance, when he’s like this,&lt; Simon feels the chair shudder as Neon hops up on top of the armrests. &gt;Simon, here, can’t look away. Watch.&lt;
&gt;You have to drill into the chair to get all the rope clips in, any wooden armchair works.&lt;
&gt;It works so that when I pull this rope - Simon. Loosen up.&lt; At Neon’s word, Simon drops all the tension in his body. He hadn’t even realize he’d been curling his toes and clenching his jaw. &gt;Don’t want to hurt you when you don’t deserve it.&lt;

&gt;It all ties together at the base here, then runs through these pulleys.&lt; 
&gt;Oh.&lt; Neon speaks slowly. &gt;I don’t know. Maybe Red taught me.&lt;
&gt;Huh?&lt; Neon’s reply is instant. &gt;Sorry, what did you say?&lt;
&gt;Simon has been good. I don’t like torture, anyway.&lt;
&gt;Apparently Yak’chozi have really good hearing.&lt; Neon sounds bored. &gt;He can probably tell where you are from your footsteps.&lt;
“His ears are twitching like crazy,” the visitor, says. Feminine voice. A girl.
 &gt;Can’t be helped. I don’t have that much space&lt; 
"Exactly."
"Exactly.
"I like you," she counters.
"I like _you_" 
"You like everything, though," Ennui says.
"It's very imposing," Malaise says. "I like it."
"Mother of fuck, that thing is ugly," Nepotism says.
less than a minute later, a ship pulls out of hyperspace. It’s tall and black, a pillar made of mottled stone.
The Awakazi servant picks up the box, stands, then bows once more before heading back to the white ship
The servant shuts off the box and the conversation ends.
“Alright, then!” The man in the hologram stands, pushing his head out of view. “Good doing business with you.”
Veritable nods.
“Sound good?” He asks.
“Good. In a moment, Lord Salisk will arrive, and you will meet her on her ship.” The hologram says. “Once there, you will swear your oaths and serve your captain.”
The figure in the hologram turns to the right and says something that Veritable fails to catch.
Veritable’s team voices a firm affirmative.
“So I take it everyone accepts.”
Ennui shakes his head.
“Are you turning down the offer?”
“It sounds a little ridiculous over the phone.”
“Yes, that is the case.”
“Just to clarify, the pirate lord we’ll be serving under is not you, but instead a teenage girl who specifically requested us over anyone else.” Ennui asks.
“Speak,” The lord says.
Everyone nods. Ennui raises a hand.
“I was told you all would be informed of the basic premise of this offer, is that correct?” The Lord of Wolves says.
“I was told you all would be informed of the basic premise of this offer, is that correct?”
He walks to Veritable's team and bows low, setting the projector on the rocky earth.
The pair stood to watch a ship, their potential employer, make it's descent. Veritable understood why. The ship was a white sphere, framed by four long streamers attached in an X shape to the hull. The fabric was gold, and flowed like liquid in the high atmosphere winds.
They must look pretty impressive, the four of them. That's good, this kind of clientele puts a lot of weight into first impressions.
-
Enn and Malaise stand and look skyward. Their cloaks, blue and green respectively, catch the wind and flutter behind their backs.           
It looks good on her, Veritable thinks. He doesn’t mention it to her.
Nepotism has a bright red cloak hanging from her shoulders. The blue inner lining flashes through from time to time, when a strong wind kicks the cloak into the air.
“Keeping up with all the fashion trends is impossible,” Nepotism sighs. “Who knew cloaks would come back?”
“Digging the cloak, Boss.” Malaise says with a grin. “She tugs on the fabric draped over her own shoulders. I got this one a few weeks ago, but i still don’t know if it’s really me yet.”
“Digging the cloak, Boss.” Malaise says with a grin. She tugs on the fabric draped over her own shoulders. I got this one a few weeks ago, but i still don’t know if it’s really me yet.”
M pushes En’s shoulder hard.
“I was surprised you called us all together, by the way,” En continues. “Especially after you disbanded the team. I figured it’d be Nepotism, crying over the phone about how she couldn’t stand another day of not seeing your constant resting bitch face.”
Veritable rolls his eyes.
“Nep hadn’t shut up to breathe until your ugly ship poked its head through the clouds.” Ennui says.
“Nep hadn’t shut up to breathe until your ugly ship poked its head through the clouds.
Malaise grins and shouts “Never better!” at the same time as Ennui says, “Terrible.”
“You’re early.” Veritable grunts, then nods to the other two, sitting atop their twin fighter, legs dangling off the edge of a wing. “Ennui. Malaise. Been a while, how are you?”
“You’re late.”
Veritable nods his response.
“Veritable!” Nepotism raises a hand in greeting.
Veritable pops open the cockpit and climbs out. He drops heavily to the ground, feeling his boots crush the rocky dirt and short grass.
They got married and it took him half a year to learn about it. After all that, it’s surprisingly good to see them all again.
He’d stopped by to visit Nepotism a month ago at her home on Pelus, but Ennui and Malaise rarely leave their hole on Vaes Aestra. And the planet’s so out of the way of everything, the only communication Veritable has with them is through infrequent calls and birthday gifts delivered to each other’s PO. boxes.
It’s been years since he’s seen them all together at once. They keep in touch, of course, but after the shit they’d done and seen, things between them had grown strained, and the team had drifted apart of its own accord.
His old team is already there, their ships are gathered in a loose semicircle around the coordinates they were given.

Veritable lands his ship on the surface of Yhinen. The planet sits just outside of the boarder of Monad space, along the outside edge of the Wakazi empire.

As is, it'd be easier to just parade around naked all the time, and not make the dolls wear anything. It's not like she doesn't do that at home or in her dorm anyway. There isn't too much of a difference, and seeing Kis get all turned on all the time just cause she steps out of her room for a glass of water definitely doesn't hurt.
Kate stuffs all her things back into her backpack and starts to think about finding a good spot for bar hopping. Hopefully she can find a cute rich guy who wouldn't expect a preppy student to rob him blind after fucking his brains out.
All she needs to do now is wait for the exhibition to open, so a ton of eyes can get all over the mark, and so she can scope the place out, grab it, hide it, then get into a "car accident" and "die" so she can go home free.
Kate feels a weight flutter out of her gut, and knows that she's about to get the best sleep these next couple weeks.
On the third truck she spots the mark. It's a small, thin wooden crate. Neatly packaged. Whatever's inside couldn't be longer than three feet and wider than six inches. Perfectly manageable. Kate grins and drops the binoculars.
It's a large 18 wheeled semi carrying a plain, white container. Completely normal. There's probably a second coming behind it.
The truck arrives three hours later. Her doodling page is covered in dicks, and she's skipped through about 4 playlists, by that time. She had recently broken out the thermostat filled with Kis's early morning coffee, and was enjoying a long, slow sip when the truck rolled into view.
Kate looks over at her compound, part of her wants to try experimenting with it, but she's a shitty enough chemist when it comes to following the instructions written there. She's just going to have to ask about it someday later. Maybe once this job's finished and she's a hundred thousand bucks richer.

That would be a pain in the ass.
That would be a pain in the ass.
It takes a minute pull all the knots out of the cord, then another to plug them in and find a playlist on her phone that she wasn't feeling completely sick of yet. After she makes up her mind and presses play, she drops the phone back into her pocket and picks up the discarded notebook.
She picks up the pen, tangled in her headphones. Today was going to be really boring if she didn't have any music to pass the time with.
Kate isn't stupid, though. She's seen all the signs for the library's coming exhibit, with the huge, thousand year old set of fucking samurai armor. If that's her package, she's beyond fucked.
Very annoying, but Kate assumes that's the type of shit anyone would have to deal with when working with someone willing to shill out two hundred fifty thou to any anonymous, college aged thief with a reasonably good track record.
The package. No specification of size or weight.
Kate scopes out the small loading dock, it's empty, and the metal shutters are locked. A little disappointing. She'll probably be up here all day. But her employer said that the package would be arriving sometime today.
Kate's fingers fiddle with the tangle of wires. How the fuck does it take less than two seconds for them to get knotted around her pen.
Then she pulls them out of her pocket.
From inside the backpack, Kate pulls a pair of binoculars which she sets aside, a scarf, that she pushes out of the way, a notebook that she drops next to her feet, and her headphones that she thought she'd lost. She stuffs those into her pocket.
A light breeze brushes her hair against the back of her neck.
Instead of heading down to the lobby, she heads up the stairs to the roof. She pushes a heavy iron door open and leaves it resting slightly ajar on the handle, so she isn't locked out.
"Alright, so don't worry, or stay up waiting or anything." Kate starts heading out the door,  then quickly turns and stops the door from slamming shut with a kick of her foot. "I start feeling guilty when that happens." Kate adds.
"Oh, uhm, okay." the other girl says from her bed.
"Alright. I'll be back late tonight, 'kay?" Kate says, glancing back through the door at her roommate.
No. Not really. Neon says. I’m starting.
She’s not really paying attention to the movie though, is she?
It’s a zombie movie? Neon asks. Red hates these…
Alright.
The Last Train to Busan, from the start.
Okay. Neon sighs. Title and time?
It’s hour 994. Tobin responds.
Tobin nods, wordless. Hell…
Yeah, that’s the fucking feeling isn’t it?
The black strings stretch out and lace across the surface of the couch and the floor and the walls and the table, knitting them away, the pillows turn to sand, the walls to a fence, and a tree, and the sky. The sun is setting, and the sky burns gold.

Tracy stares at the ceiling. He’s sitting on the couch in the living room. Liz’s legs are kicked over his lap while she takes the corner seat. Eao is across from Liz, next to Tracy. The two of them are in the middle of a conversation, and it’s gotten to the point where Tracy can’t even hear the words they’re saying anymore. So he stares at the ceiling, and thinks about…………Tits. Boobies. Butts too. Ass. It’s been a while. Actually it’s been a really long fucking time. At least since he can actually remember getting laid. He lied to Kisket the last time she asked. He hadn’t hooked up with anyone from that bar. He hadn’t hooked up with that girl Asheya. He doesn’t count Elesa. Shanta hated him from the start. Even before then,  on Earth, he couldn’t remember the last time he had ever had sex with someone that he didn’t pay for first. No actual emotional connections. Just bumping fucking uglies for thirty minutes so he could blow his fucking load. It wasn’t anything. He’s never had anything. Fuck, that’s a depressing thought. Tracy’s usually got more self control, but sitting here on this couch with nothing to distract him, while his little cousin gets all touchy-feely, because she’s a cruel bitch and knows exactly how to fuck with him. It’s not doing him any good. No. He’s not going to pay for sex again. It’d be like… Backsliding. A year and a half worth of self-improvement, gone. Instantly. That’s what it’d be like. But the fact of the matter is. None of the girls around him even consider him a half-suitable partner. It’s sad. Tracy is sad.He drops his head to look at Liz. She’s rolling her eyes at something Eao just said. Might as well zone back in.“No, really. I’ve got an album and everything. I mean it’s more of an LP, and I made all the beats in the garage back at the monastery, but it’s one hundred percent true. I even sold copies.”“What’re you talking about?” Tracy asks.“This dumbass expects me to believe she’s also a rapper.” Liz explains. Tracy glances at Eao. She’s grinning like an idiot.“So… Monk, pirate, bounty hunter, professional cage fighter, supermodel, background dancer, actress, and a fucking rapper now?” Tracy asks. “What’s next are you gonna say you were an astronaut?”Eao runs a finger through her hair. “Well, technically… aren’t we all-”“Please don’t finish that sentence.” Tracy rubs his face.Nobody says anything for a while. There’s a bit of silence, as everyone looks in different directions. Tracy feels his eyes dragging back up toward the ceiling. They’re stopped when Liz speaks up.“You could prove it, actually…” She says. “Tracy’s beatboxing is super solid. If you can freestyle to him, I’ll believe you.”“No fucking way.” Tracy says.Liz pouts. “Oh come on!”“I’m not gonna beat-box on command.” Tracy frowns.Liz kicks her legs a bit in frustration.“You beat-box?” Eao asks.Tracy really doesn’t want to deal with this. Especially not after Liz woke him up by literally throwing herself on top him on the couch. Kids are supposed to outgrow that shit when they turn eight. “Sort of.”“That’s cool!” Eao shouts, “So do I, it’s how I made those beats in the garage.”“What kind of monastery even has a garage?!” Liz shouts, “And where the fuck did you get the recording stuff?!”Eao scoffs.“Uh. One: the coolest kinds. And two: it was pretty fucking easy. But shit, if you want me to prove it to you, bring it. I’m not scared. Actually yeah, I’ll even challenge Tracy to a beat-boxing fight.”“Oh my god.” Tracy says.“He accepts!” Liz shouts, “You’re fucking on!”“Training room, then. Four o’clock, be there or be square.” Eao says. Tracy realizes that she just said ‘be there or be square,’ one hundred percent seriously. He can’t believe it.
Tobin showed Neon how to use the rec. room’s coffee machine. She makes a cup for Red now, not one for herself, she hates the taste, always has. It’s too bitter, and if you want it to not be bitter you have to drown the flavor in sugar, which is just as bad. Neon feels Red’s eyes on her, she watches herself through those eyes. Red takes very long breaths. Neon watches herself roll her head and shoulders. Stretch her neck and adjust her feet. The coffee is almost ready. It smells nice. Neon loves the smell of coffee.She scoops up the cup in her hand, grabs the saucer she left on the counter and heads over to the table. She places the cup and saucer in front of Red and sits across from her. Neon kicks her feet up to rest on red’s thighs. A hand reaches down to squeeze her toes. Perfect.“I’m still kind of shocked.” Red says. She sips her coffee.“At what?” Neon’s eyebrows furrow.Red puts the cup down. She reaches an arm out toward the center of the room. “All this. You being… alive… and of all things, a pirate? “It was different at first.” Neon shrugs. “I had built a home underneath a city, and I was trying to build a circle like yours. I already had a really good Kazchke, before monad started attacking me. And I was running from them, when I met Vica, and she offered a place here and then… uh. A lot.”Red nods slowly.“When I first met Vica she seemed like she’d make a perfect Oryx. But, I don’t really think so anymore. I’ve got others now though, not a Kazchke, but a great Sholas, a pretty okay Hasha, and a fucking excellent Euridime.”“So you’ve been… trying to be me?” Red says.Neon looks away. “You have to be as strong on the inside as you are on the outside, right? Well I haven’t been feeling strong enough...”“What happened?” Red frowns.“I was mad, I think, and I let myself really go. Just as far as it wanted to take me. And the next thing I know I was putting knives under a pilot’s fingernails and my hair was angry black, and I looked just like…”“Princess Mizerkah?” Red sighs.Neon nods.“I’m sorry.”Neon shakes her head.“I’m really sorry Miz.”Neon drops her head on the table. Red squeezes her foot. Her hands are warm.“It’s okay.” Neon says. “You’re back. We’re back. Together. That’s all that matters.”“I love you Miz.” Sirie says.
“We should do something fun today.” Neon says, rolling off the bed. She lands naked, on all fours on the floor and pushes herself to a stand. She stretches her arms above her head and her tail arcs back and up in line with her spine.“We do fun things every day, Miz” Red looks over and watches her pick through the clothes that she had left folded on the dresser last night.“There’s such a thing as too much sex, you know.” Neon’s ears twitch at the soft scratch of suede against denim. She doesn’t turn her head to watch Red stand. She feels the heat in Red’s head, the eagerness in her hands, the hunger in her footsteps and pretends to notice a shirt she likes. Neon pulls it out, pinches it at the seams of its sleeves and holds it in the air, lifting her arms away from her torso. Inviting, for Red’s benefit. Her move, now. “What do you think of this one?” It’s Marche Slave green, slim, short sleeved, long shirt-tail. It would reach way past her waist. The fabric shimmers a little when it catches the dim light from the ceiling. Red’s fingers graze the underside of Neon’s ribcage. The hands glide across her stomach and settle just above her pelvis. Red’s shoulders and chest press against her back and Red’s mouth kisses the nape of her neck.“I don’t know,” Red says. “It’ll look good.” Red kisses Neon’s neck again, then adds in her head. You look good.Neon pulls on the sleeves, letting the shirt stretch taut. She cranes her neck to the side, giving her room to roam. “I was thinking something a little less on the visceral side.” She hears the pause that sentence sends through Red’s head. “After this, of course.” Neon shudders when one of the hands pushes down at a diagonal to her the top of her left thigh, and another drags upward.What did you have in mind? Red’s thoughts cool quickly, the fever-heat from moments ago, replaced by cool interest and attention. There’s also the warm flush that Red always has when she sees Neon that makes Neon smile at all the worst times, but that doesn’t ever stop.What if we just talked? Neon asks. Red pulls her head back. Her hands freeze.Neon turns her head to meet Red’s eyes. They’re hard, with sharp edges. Her head is full of hazy, mechanical, clockwork thoughts. Appreciative, not angry. Her senses are still blurred in the remnants of that bleeding heat of hers. Neon’s own senses are like knives, or needle pricks.“Okay.” Red says, “We’ll do that.” Red’s hands start to drop away, and Neon quickly reaches down to catch them. The shirt catches the edge of the dresser before it drops to the floor. The sound of Red’s breaths merges with the low hum of the ship around the two of them. The room is stuffy and it smells sickly sweet. Neither of them have bothered to open the AC vents for the past couple days. It smells like Red. Neon pulls Red’s hands back into place. “After.” Neon says. Red’s mind ignites once again. I thought I was supposed to be the eager one.
"No, just- stop fucking with the wind, okay?"
"I'll set the wind back up to thirty for you," Noz reaches for the remote in her pocket.
“Quote me on this.” Jan points at Noz, “Nothing, nothing at all beats the rush you get when you lead a shot by a hundred yards and dome the driver of a speeding truck from a mile away. That’s when you know you’re fucking sick.”
“No I get it," Jannessen says. "I like seeing technical skill in action. I mean that shit its why I only use 20 year old rifles. All the new ones have so much anti-this and anti-that. All you have to do is put the dot on the dude, pull the trigger, and watch them drop. It’s lame.”
“The bullshit is what makes it fun to watch.” Noz frowns, “Ugh, you don’t get it.”
“He got a hit in, too. BD was so pissed,” Noz says. She stands out of her chair and helps Jan up to her feet. “I think it was the second time I’d ever seen Eao go aggressive on someone.” 
Aradia lies back, hair into the sand. It's still a little warm.
Shadows move through the trees in the forest across the river. Aradia's feet are still on Mars's legs, but his are now stretched out in sand. He looks at the water the reflection of the treetops and a red-purple cloud above them. 
Mars looks at her. Veruvi doesn't get to have that look. Aradia can tell. Mars nods.
"Will you take me back to the river?" Aradia smiles.
"Uh-huh." Mars nods.
"I'm really drunk." Aradia says.
Aradia looks at the bottle of Vaes Aestran wine on the table. It's empty. She can't remember how many glasses either of them had. 
It's not even Mars' fault he acts like that. It's that bitch Veruvi's. She's still somewhere out there, existing. So apparently Mars owes her.
"What?" Mars frowns.
It's much too easy to slip into Mars' dynamic with him. The push-pull, step in-step out, sort of sway. She doesn't like that, the moments where he pulls away or steps out come much too often.
Using the table was cute, and sweet and romantic and all, but the couch is way more comfortable. It's got this familiarity about it, that the table doesn't have. That, and she gets to lie down and put her feet up on Mars's lap whenever he finishes and puts hit plate up on the table. He pretends he hates it and whines and complains, as much as possible without actually moving them. 
Aradia's a fan of this unspoken decision to always eat dinner on the couch.
I am ready

“Alright, lets go again,” Eao says. Tracy’s head is gonna fucking explode.
Tracy does not know how he got into this situation. He’s in boxing shorts, shirt off, in the ring in the center of the training room. His hands are wrapped in tape and chalked, and he’s being fed water from a sports bottle by Liz. Across from him Eao is in a similar situation, with Cypress massaging her shoulders. She gets up and takes a couple bouncing steps, back and forth in front of her chair, practicing jabs as she goes.All he can think currently, is: What the shitting fuck is going on?.Liz pushes Tracy out of the chair and he staggers to the center of the ring. Eao is there to meet him. They touch gloves. This is fucking stupid. Eao backs off and Tracy mimics her automatically. Cypress puts the music on. The fight starts...Eao takes four quick steps forward and jabs. The punch catches Tracy in the shoulder. It fucking hurts. A lot. She goes in for another and the sensory overload of this bullshit situation hits him like a truck. Eao’s fist has all but stopped. He can see the strain in her bicep as muscles compress and begin to extend. Her left foot pushes off the ground while her right slides across the floor. Her boobs are a soft blue, freckled?! They’re squeezed into a tight tank top.They jiggle a bit with the force from her steps. Captivating. Eao’s eyes scan Tracy’s posture and he can see the dilation of her pupils when she finds the place she wants to hit. Abdomens: low hook, left fist, right side. It’d be easy to move out of the way, step back, if only he could first stop moving, and push himself backward, but his current momentum is too strong. As is Tracy’s headed straight for the impact with Eao’s fist. He could push off though. Even more forward momentum, to push into and past the attack. At the very least she wouldn’t see it coming. Not from him. She doesn’t know about his Oxium either. Is this Oxium right now?Something clicks. Or maybe a thread snaps. He pushes with his feet, brings his arms up. Eao notices, but too little, too late. Her punch is already beginning to be thrown. Muscles are pushing, hard. Eao’s right hand is being brought up, but it’ll only catch Tracy’s left arm. His right will be free. He’ll whip his elbow around, so it collides with the space below her ribs. Her arm will hook around his back, when she falls, he’ll fall too, but above her. If he grabs her right arm he can pin it behind her head. Her right leg should be easy to lock under his own, too. Okay. Shift tempo, slow it down, execute.…Tracy is on top of Eao, one knee on the floor, between her legs. His left leg is wrapped around her right. His left hand is holding her wrist, with her hand beneath her shoulder. Her elbow grazes his ear. The other arm is stretched out. He has the crook of her elbow caught under his forearm. He’s heavy. She can’t push him off of her, can’t pull her leg out. The other leg isn’t doing anything. Eao blinks. Her breaths are quick, and they jostle Tracy’s hair with every exhale. He thought Eao had blue eyes. They aren't. They’re turquoise. Her tits are still squashed beneath that shirt and she smells like freshly cleaned clothes, or fresh milk. Tracy actually can’t tell which. He feels her strain against his hold, as Eao gets over the inital shock. She grunts a tiny bit, then relaxes. She meets his eyes. Tracy’s head drops. Tracy rolls to the left, off of her, making sure not to squash her left arm, but pushing her elbow to the side. He sits up. Gulps for air. Looks over as Eao does the same. Her chest heaves in time with the four quick breaths she takes.Eao looks over at him. “What the fuck was that?” She asks. “Uh,” Tracy says, “Oxium. I think.”She whistles. “Fucking, wow.”

She gets up and takes a couple bouncing steps, back and forth in front of her chair, practicing jabs as she goes.All he can think currently, is: What the shitting fuck is going on?.Liz pushes Tracy out of the chair and he staggers to the center of the ring. Eao is there to meet him. They touch gloves. This is fucking stupid. Eao backs off and Tracy mimics her automatically. Cypress puts the music on. The fight starts...Eao takes four quick steps forward and jabs. The punch catches Tracy in the shoulder. It fucking hurts. A lot. She goes in for another and the sensory overload of this bullshit situation hits him like a truck. Eao’s fist has all but stopped. He can see the strain in her bicep as muscles compress and begin to extend. Her left foot pushes off the ground while her right slides across the floor. Her boobs are a soft blue, freckled?! They’re squeezed into a tight tank top.They jiggle a bit with the force from her steps. Captivating. Eao’s eyes scan Tracy’s posture and he can see the dilation of her pupils when she finds the place she wants to hit. Abdomens: low hook, left fist, right side. It’d be easy to move out of the way, step back, if only he could first stop moving, and push himself backward, but his current momentum is too strong. As is Tracy’s headed straight for the impact with Eao’s fist. He could push off though. Even more forward momentum, to push into and past the attack. At the very least she wouldn’t see it coming. Not from him. She doesn’t know about his Oxium either. Is this Oxium right now?Something clicks. Or maybe a thread snaps. He pushes with his feet, brings his arms up. Eao notices, but too little, too late. Her punch is already beginning to be thrown. Muscles are pushing, hard. Eao’s right hand is being brought up, but it’ll only catch Tracy’s left arm. His right will be free. He’ll whip his elbow around, so it collides with the space below her ribs. Her arm will hook around his back, when she falls, he’ll fall too, but above her. If he grabs her right arm he can pin it behind her head. Her right leg should be easy to lock under his own, too. Okay. Shift tempo, slow it down, execute.…Tracy is on top of Eao, one knee on the floor, between her legs. His left leg is wrapped around her right. His left hand is holding her wrist, with her hand beneath her shoulder. Her elbow grazes his ear. The other arm is stretched out. He has the crook of her elbow caught under his forearm. He’s heavy. She can’t push him off of her, can’t pull her leg out. The other leg isn’t doing anything. Eao blinks. Her breaths are quick, and they jostle Tracy’s hair with every exhale. He thought Eao had blue eyes. They aren't. They’re turquoise. Her tits are still squashed beneath that shirt and she smells like freshly cleaned clothes, or fresh milk. Tracy actually can’t tell which. He feels her strain against his hold, as Eao gets over the inital shock. She grunts a tiny bit, then relaxes. She meets his eyes. Tracy’s head drops. Tracy rolls to the left, off of her, making sure not to squash her left arm, but pushing her elbow to the side. He sits up. Gulps for air. Looks over as Eao does the same. Her chest heaves in time with the four quick breaths she takes.Eao looks over at him. “What the fuck was that?” She asks. “Uh,” Tracy says, “Oxium. I think.”She whistles. “Fucking, wow.”

Tobin showed Neon how to use the rec. room’s coffee machine. She makes a cup for Red now, not one for herself, she hates the taste, always has. It’s too bitter, and if you want it to not be bitter you have to drown the flavor in sugar, which is just as bad. Neon feels Red’s eyes on her, she watches herself through those eyes. Red takes very long breaths. Neon watches herself roll her head and shoulders. Stretch her neck and adjust her feet. The coffee is almost ready. It smells nice. Neon loves the smell of coffee.She scoops the cup in her hand, grabs the saucer she left on the counter and heads over to the table. She places the cup and saucer in front of Red and sits across from her. Neon kicks her feet up to rest on red’s thighs. A hand reaches down to squeeze her toes. Perfect.“I’m still kind of shocked.” Red says. She sips her coffee.“At what?” Neon’s eyebrows furrow.Red puts the cup down. She reaches an arm out toward the center of the room. “All this. You being… alive… and of all things, a pirate? “It was different at first.” Neon shrugs. “I had built a home underneath a city, and I was trying to build a circle like yours. I already had a really good Kazchke, before monad started attacking me. And I was running from them, when I met Vica, and she offered a place here and then… uh. A lot.”Red nods slowly.“When I first met Vica she seemed like she’d make a perfect Oryx. But, I don’t really think so anymore. I’ve got others now though, not a Kazchke, but a great Sholas, a pretty okay Hasha, and a fucking excellent Euridime.”“So you’ve been… trying to be me?” Red says.Neon looks away. “You have to be as strong on the inside as you are on the outside, right? Well I haven’t been feeling strong enough...”“What happened?” Red frowns.“I was mad, I think, and I let myself really go. Just as far as it wanted to take me. And the next thing I know I was putting knives under a pilot’s fingernails and my hair was angry black, and I looked just like…”“Princess Mizerkah?” Red sighs.Neon nods.“I’m sorry.”Neon shakes her head.“I’m really sorry Miz.”Neon drops her head on the table. Red squeezes her foot. Her hands are warm.“It’s okay.” Neon says. “You’re back. We’re back. Together. That’s all that matters.”“I love you Miz.” Sirie says.

“We should do something fun today.” Neon says, rolling off the bed. She lands naked, on all fours on the floor and pushes herself to a stand. She stretches her arms above her head and her tail arcs back and up in line with her spine.“We do fun things every day, Miz” Red looks over and watches her pick through the clothes that she had left folded on the dresser last night.“There’s such a thing as too much sex, you know.” Neon’s ears twitch at the soft scratch of suede against denim. She doesn’t turn her head to watch Red stand. She feels the heat in Red’s head, the eagerness in her hands, the hunger in her footsteps and pretends to notice a shirt she likes. Neon pulls it out, pinches it at seams of its sleeves and holds it in the air, lifting her arms away from her torso. Inviting, for Red’s benefit. Her move, now. “What do you think of this one?” It’s Marche Slave green, slim, short sleeved, long shirt-tail. It would reach way past her waist. The fabric shimmers a little when it catches the dim light from the ceiling. Red’s fingers graze the underside of Neon’s ribcage. The hands glide across her stomach and settle just above her pelvis. Red’s shoulders and chest press against her back and Red’s mouth kisses the nape of her neck.“I don’t know,” Red says. “It’ll look good.” Red kisses Neon’s neck again, then adds in her head. You look good.Neon pulls on the sleeves, letting the shirt stretch taut. She cranes her neck to the side, giving her room to roam. “I was thinking something a little less on the visceral side.” She hears the pause that sentence sends through Red’s head. “After this, of course.” Neon shudders when one of the hands pushes down at a diagonal to her the top of her left thigh, and another drags upward.What did you have in mind? Red’s thoughts cool quickly, the fever-heat from moments ago, replaced by cool interest and attention. There’s also the warm flush that Red always has when she sees Neon that makes Neon smile at all the worst times, but that doesn’t ever stop.What if we just talked? Neon asks. Red pulls her head back. Her hands freeze.Neon turns her head to meet Red’s eyes. They’re hard, with sharp edges. Her head is full of hazy, mechanical, clockwork thoughts. Appreciative, not angry. Her senses are still blurred in the remnants of that bleeding heat of hers. Neon’s own senses are like knives, or needle pricks.“Okay.” Red says, “We’ll do that.” Red’s hands start to drop away, and Neon quickly reaches down to catch them. The shirt catches the edge of the dresser before it drops to the floor. The sound of Red’s breaths merges with the low hum of the ship around the two of them. The room is stuffy and it smells sickly sweet. Neither of them have bothered to open the AC vents for the past couple days. It smells like Red. Neon pulls Red’s hands back into place. “After.” Neon says. Red’s mind ignites once again. I thought I was supposed to be the eager one.

I don’t even feel the ship land. Even lacking dedicated hands, Tashen is an incredible pilot. His neck cranes to face us all and in his quiet, even voice he says, “Alright, we’ve arrived. I’m opening the doors.” Lady Wolf stands first, smoothing out her dress with her hands. Then Etainien rises to her feet, giving me access to scoot myself out of the booth. Tashen opens the doors. A rush of cold air fills the one-room lander. A small walkway descends from the ship to the grassy earth below and Lady Wolf takes the first step outside. Lord Wolf pulls himself out of the copilot’s seat while Tashen goes through a check of the ships systems and begins the shutdown process. Etainien, now outside as well, stretches, her skirt of tail feathers flutter and flex in the breeze. I stand a little stiffer with my hands clasped behind my back when Lord Wolf steps down off the pilot’s platform and into the main cabin. His eyes fly straight past me, though. Instead, outside, to Etainien and


 his Lady. He follows them out.As the three outside acclimate themselves to solid ground I stop in the door to check on Tashen. He moves slowly, in practiced motions around all the ships controls. Most ships are designed for bipedal pilots. The layout forces Tashen to take awkward positions. He gingerly dips his head to avoid catching his antlers on a panel filled with dials and levers on the ceiling. Then he rolls to the side to bend his knees under the handles. He notices me watching.“Don’t worry about me,” He says. “I’ll follow you out in a moment.” “Oh, okay,” I nod. “Is it always this hard to get in and out?” I ask, still standing in the doorway.“In everything but my fighter, yes. It’s why I don’t pilot very often, too much inconvenience.”I look outside for a moment. Etainien is fiddling with some of her instruments, taking scans and measurements while Lord and Lady Wolf talk a little ways up toward the rocks. We landed in the same clearing that Sirie did the last time I was on Crotia. How long ago 



was that? A month? “That sounds hard.” I say.Tashen steps one hind leg out of the seat and onto the floor, then slowly pulls the other after it. “It is,” he says, “But only because I enjoy piloting so much.” He gets his other leg out as well and steps down into the main cabin. “The Lord Wolf had my fighter custom made for me after he chose me for the inner circle. The fit is effortless, and it controls like a dream.” I make my way out outside and he follows.“He chose you?”“Yes, I suppose we have that in common. But I’m both his first mate and his fleet admiral. I don’t go out of my way to search for proteges.”“And thats why you weren’t at the introduction ceremony thing?”Tashen dips his head. “You’re not forced to attend unless you’re inducting someone. If I absolutely had to go, I’d probably choose Idrethal’s pilot, Rinsler, but I don’t think that would sit well with him.“Right, that makes sense.”We make our way to the others. Etainien finishes with whatever she’s been working on, and joins us on our way to the cave entrance, already opened. Lord and Lady wolf are inside; we follow them.The path is straightforward compared to last time, something about the oxium levels dispersing, and causality shifting back to normal. I don’t really pay attention to what Etainien says after the first thirty seconds. With her droning on and the facility’s AI voice thing only acknowledging Lady Wolf’s presence, the even textured metal walls and floors their evenly spaced lights and long, straight hallways it’s incredibly easy to get lost in thought.A month. Maybe less since I was here. With Shanta and Sirie and the others. I handled those relationships terribly. How many times did I disappear on them? I’m not too sure. I don’t think I can get away with it anymore. Not this time, at least. No coming back and getting a warm hug and a breakfast full of pancakes. Fuck.And that’s without mentioning Sirie. Or Mars. Or Uti. Or Faye. I don’t know how any of them are doing. I don’t know anything. I’m alone. I did this. But I don’t even know how? I’ve never really been one to make decisions. I think I’ve always sort of just let things happen to me. And as soon as I get sick of that and start doing things myself, I fuck everything up. I’m a fucking mess. I don’t even deserve them anyway. Of course I don’t. I’m here. This is where I belong. Where I’m meant to be.…At least I can be sure I’m working toward something good. Lady Wolf’s been nothing but truthful to me. I’m glad for that. It’s like… The one thing I’ve been missing, that I’ve really needed all my life. Everyone lies to me. All the time, one lie after another. First Sirie, then Faye, Mars constantly, Shanta, Kisket, Luden, Yvelte. I can count the people who haven’t on one hand. Lady Wolf. Carnix. Veritable. I don’t get how telling the truth makes you “evil.” Everyone hated Carnix. Most people still hate Lady Wolf. And nobody even pretends to like Veritable. Not even the people he works with. What’s the fucking point?What’s the fucking point.Etainien seemed to have shut up eventually after she got bored of my humming and nodding. We’re at that door again. The big one that Sirie tried to stop us from going through. Lord Wolf pushes it open. The honey-gold light from within spreads across the damp hallway, reflecting in the pools beneath our feet like fire on stone. Inside, the room has been reconstructed, or maybe replaced with something that looks a bit like a nursery. I guess. If that nursery had belonged to a trillionaire. A crystal chandelier reflects and refracscattered lights across the room, illuminating scripts of text on a smooth, black, stone wall. The wall is framed by small waterfalls that flow backward up either side of the rock. The trickling sound of water bounced off the corners and ceiling and gave the room an air of unbreakable calm, at least it would have had we not entered all at once, armed, armored, weapons primed, save for Lady Wolf, with her hands clasped pleasantly in front of her, with her expressionless mask as blank as always. We all take aim at the woman in the chair in front of us, her back still turned, the gaudy white hair flowing behind her, and onto the floor, with some sort of silk robe draped over her shoulders. 04, The Fool, was what the facility called her. Lady Wolf calls her “Brother.”“-it’s nice to finally meet you.” Lady Wolf finishes.The Fool turns in the chair to look at us. Nothing about her changed over the month since the last time I was here, It doesn’t look like she took one step outside of this room. She says, clearly to the room, “Turn off the simulation,” and the light and the stone scenery melts into motes of gold and color into the floor and the walls, out of sight, leaving us at the edge of a cold grey room, and her sitting on a stool in the center of a raised platform.“You’re 03. You’re the Moon?” The Fool says. In Ahamkara. Her voice is deadpan. She sounds almost angry.Lady Wolf nods. “Yes.”“Which face are you?” The Fool asks, “What syllable?”Lady Wolf frowns, she seems to have a hard time finding a reply.The Fool waits a moment, then frowns. “Leave. You have nothing to say to me.”Lord Wolf grips his gun tighter. Lady Wolf lays her hand over his. She pushes the weapon out of the way. “Alright.” Lady Wolf says, “We’ll leave.”Then we turn back around and head back to the lander. Lady Wolf pulls the mask off her face. Her breaths are ragged and her shoulders shudder. She lets Lord Wolf pull her close and doesn’t say a word.

Inside, the room has been reconstructed, or maybe replaced with something that looks a bit like a nursery. I guess. If that nursery had belonged to a trillionaire. A crystal chandelier reflect and refract scattered lights across the room, illuminating scripts of text on a smooth, black, stone wall. The wall is framed by small waterfalls that flow backward up either side of the rock. The trickling sound of water bounced off the corners and ceiling and gave the room an air of unbreakable calm, at least it would have had we not entered all at once, armed, armored, weapons primed, save for Lady Wolf, with her hands clasped pleasantly in front of her, with her expressionless mask as blank as always. We all take aim at the woman in the chair in front of us, her back still turned, the gaudy white hair flowing behind her, and onto the floor, with some sort of silk robe draped over her shoulders. 04, The Fool, was what the facility called her. Lady Wolf calls her “Brother.”“-it’s nice to finally meet you.” Lady Wolf finishes.The Fool turns in the chair to look at us. Nothing about her changed over the month since the last time I was here, It doesn’t look like she took one step outside of this room. She says, clearly to the room, “Turn off the simulation,” and the light and the stone scenery melts into motes of gold and color into the floor and the walls, out of sight, leaving us at the edge of a cold grey room, and her sitting on a stool in the center of a raised platform.“You’re 03. You’re the Moon?” The Fool says. In Ahamkara. Her voice is deadpan. She sounds almost angry.Lady Wolf nods. “Yes.”“Which face are you?” The Fool asks, “What syllable?”Lady Wolf frowns, she seems to have a hard time finding a reply.The Fool waits a moment, then frowns. “Leave. You have nothing to say to me.”Lord Wolf grips his gun tighter. Lady Wolf lays her hand over his. She pushes the weapon out of the way. “Alright.” Lady Wolf says, “We’ll leave.”Then we turn back around and head back to the lander. Lady Wolf pulls the mask off her face. Her breaths are ragged and her shoulders shudder. She lets Lord Wolf pull her close and doesn’t say a word. 
{ The Fool - 1 }I don’t even feel the ship land. Even lacking dedicated hands, Tashen is an incredible pilot. His neck cranes to face us all and in his quiet, even voice he says, “Alright, we’ve arrived. I’m opening the doors.” Lady Wolf stands first, smoothing out her dress with her hands. Then Etainien rises to her feet, giving me access to scoot myself out of the booth. Tashen opens the doors. A rush of cold air fills the one-room lander. A small walkway descends from the ship to the grassy earth below and Lady Wolf takes the first step outside. Lord Wolf pulls himself out of the copilot’s seat while Tashen goes through a check of the ships systems and begins the shutdown process. Etainien, now outside as well, stretches, her skirt of tail feathers flutter and flex in the breeze. I stand a little stiffer, with my hands clasped behind my back when Lord Wolf steps down off the pilot’s platform and into the main cabin. His eyes fly straight past me, though, outside, to Etainien and to his Lady. He follows them out.As the three outside acclimate themselves to solid ground I stop in the door to check on Tashen. He moves slowly, in practiced motions around all the ships controls. Most ships are designed for bipedal pilots. The layout forces Tashen to take awkward positions. He gingerly dips his head to avoid catching his antlers on a panel filled with dials and levers on the ceiling. Then he rolls to the side to bend his knees under the handles. He notices me watching.“Don’t worry about me,” He says. “I’ll follow you out in a moment.” “Oh, okay,” I nod. “Is it always this hard to get in and out?” I ask, still standing in the doorway.“In everything but my fighter, yes. It’s why I don’t pilot very often, too much inconvenience.”I look outside for a moment. Etainien is fiddling with some of her instruments, taking scans and measurements while Lord and Lady Wolf talk a little ways up toward the rocks. We landed in the same clearing that Krayna landed the last time I was on Crotia. How long ago was that? A month? “That sounds hard.” I say.Tashen steps one hind leg out of the seat and onto the floor, then slowly pulls the other after it. “It is,” he says, “But only because I enjoy piloting so much.” He gets his other leg out as well and steps down into the main cabin. “The Lord Wolf had my fighter custom made for me after he chose me for the inner circle. The fit is effortless, and it controls like a dream.” I make my way out outside and he follows.“He chose you?”“Yes, I suppose we have that in common. But I’m both his first mate and his fleet admiral. I don’t go out of my way to search for proteges.”“And thats why you weren’t at the introduction ceremony thing?”Tashen dips his head. “You’re not forced to attend unless you’re inducting someone. If I absolutely had to go, I’d probably choose Idrethal’s pilot, Rinsler, but I don’t think that would sit well with him.“Right, that makes sense.”We make our way to the others. Etainien finishes with whatever she’s been working on, and joins us on our way to the cave entrance, already opened. Lord and Lady wolf are already inside. We follow them.The path is straightforward compared to last time, something about the oxium levels dispersing, and causality shifting back to normal I don’t really pay attention to what Etainien says after the first thirty seconds. With her droning on and the facility’s AI voice thing only acknowledging Lady Wolf’s presence, the even textured metal walls and floors their evenly spaced lights and long, straight hallways it’s incredibly easy to get lost in thought.A month. Maybe less since I was here. With Shanta and Sirie and the others. I handled those relationships terribly. How many times did I disappear on them? I’m not too sure. I don’t think I can get away with it anymore. Not this time, at least. No coming back and getting a warm hug and a breakfast full of pancakes. Fuck.And that’s without mentioning Sirie. Or Mars. Or Uti. Or Faye. I don’t know how any of them are doing. I don’t know anything. I’m alone. I did this. But I don’t even know how? I’ve never really been one to make decisions. I think I’ve always sort of just let things happen to me. And as soon as I get sick of that and start doing things myself, I fuck everything up. I’m a fucking mess. I don’t even deserve them anyway. Of course I don’t. I’m here. This is where I belong. Where I’m meant to be.…At least I can be sure I’m working toward something good. Lady Wolf’s been nothing but truthful to me. I’m glad for that. It’s like… The one thing I’ve been missing, that I’ve really needed all my life. Everyone lies to me. All the time, one lie after another. First Sirie, then Faye, Mars constantly, Shanta, Kisket, Luden, Yvelte. I can count the people who haven’t on one hand. Lady Wolf. Carnix. Veritable. I don’t get how telling the truth makes you “evil.” Everyone hated Carnix. Most people still hate Lady Wolf. And nobody even pretends to like Veritable. Not even the people he works with. What’s the fucking point?What’s the fucking point.Etainien seemed to have shut up eventually after she got bored of my humming and nodding. We’re at that door again.

Veruvi opens a message from Lady wolf. She’s sitting up on her bed in her ship. The ship’s aesthetic revolves around blacks and reds. It screams stereotypical evil. It’s sort of annoying. Veruvi’s been thinking of swapping the reds to greens. It’d fit better with her armor and her oxium. And It might curry some favor with Ludovica, keeping in the same aesthetic as the Marche slave. But the message. It’s a link to a news article. Veruvi taps on the link. The page loads. “War Criminal Sirie Rhae, Escaped from Xi-hon Prison.” What the fuck. When the fuck was she in prison? She reads further, The video footage has been erased, and none of the guards seem to remember when or how she escaped. All of their memories seem to blank out at the same time, save for one, who can remember being with her and a pair of visitors for a few minutes after that time, but can’t remember any details of how she disappeared. Veruvi slows down.All of the guards describe an intense green light, save for the one who was with Sirie, who distinctly remembers a figure with intense pink hair.Veruvi gets another message. “a little interesting, isn’t it? worth investigating dont u think?She puts her phone down.It’s 4:00 in the morning on Zenithon. By now, just about everyone has gone to bed or is still asleep. Tracy wakes up at 4:10 every day. He’s charted the times out. He gets out of bed, grabs his towel and heads to the showers. There, he double checks there’s nobody around. He turns on the hot water, waits a moment for it to heat up, strips off his shirt and boxer briefs and steps inside.Tracy’s always been one for pleasantly warm showers, though lately he’s been slowly ramping the heat up. Today he turns it up a little hotter than yesterday. It burns on his scalp, in lines down his skin. He crouches, then reaches out with a hand to steady himself, then sits, on the shower floor with his legs curled up toward his head. He rests his arms on his knees and his head on his arms and thinks for a while, while the hot water drums on his scalp.He gets onto his knees, turns the heat up slightly higher, and masturbates under the burning rain.Kate can’t sleep. She’s been staring at the ceiling for an hour and a half. She’s upset. Clearly. And the fact that she’s upset is only making her more upset. Like she’s upset at herself, for being upset at herself, for being upset about motherfucking Neon. Of all fucking people.But.Jesus fucking Christ. Nobody’s ever done what she did. Not even close. She’d never felt sensations like the ones Neon made her feel. It’s addictive. It’s terrible. Kate shudders with the thought. It’s no use. She’s not going to be able to sleep like this. She throws the covers off her and gets out of bed.Kate pulls on a pair of shorts and a tank top. She opens up her bedroom door and heads to the usual rec-room. It takes her a little while to get there on foot, mostly because the floor is cold and she forgot to bring shoes at first and had to run back to put on a pair. Upon arriving, though, she was pleasantly unsurprised to find Sasha there, on his laptop. Sometimes Kate wishes he wasn’t so obviously attracted to her, but as the only human woman in horror squad, she understands. It’s just a bit of a pain. She likes Sasha, he’s a great friend. A really great friend, but he doesn’t do anything for her outside of that. He doesn’t make her shiver with anticipation at the threat of a touch or make her heart pump in her ears when he looks her way. Which is fine! Nobody should be able to do that. Especially not to Kate mother fucking Velitasera. She’s supposed to be the one who does that to other people. She did that to that old roommate in college, who used to spy on her when she brought home guys from parties to fuck at three in the morning and who’d wait quietly for them to leave so she could have a chance to “clean” her in the shower before skittering off to class like a good girl was supposed to.Except now she’s the roommate, and she’s doing the spying and the waiting, like a perfectly trained puppy waiting for her fucking Sunday treat, and it’s the most humiliating, dehumanizing shit she’s ever felt. And there’s a part of her that’s fucking loving it. Maybe it’s all her shitty karma catching back up with her. Maybe she’s finally getting put in her place. Kate really doesn’t know, but whatever it is, it’s eating her up.Sasha finally notices Kate when she sits down next to him. He’s watching a movie. She doesn’t know which.“Woah, uh, hey Kate. Everything alright?” He asks.Kate takes a second to breathe, then she says. “Actually-”
And he says, "Kate. What the fuck."
Sasha doesn't say anything throughout.
And then I loop back to the beginning. All the teasing and the touching and the innuendo and the leers and the glances and the looks and smiles and teeth and whispered words into my ears and hair and head when nobody was looking. How her tail would slip between my legs when she was sitting next to me and I wasn't paying attention and she'd grin and I would want to scream at her in front of everyone, but I don't, because I'm afraid of what she is and what she'll do. And how that fear drives me crazy, now, because I want to feel it, I can't even get off anymore without thinking about her because nothing gives me that lurch of fear like her fucking leering, dead fucking eyes. And it's so, fucking good once it comes.
"Well, tell me about it." He says.
Sasha pulls off his headphones. The movie is already paused.
"Not really at all."
And then I tell him everything, starting somewhere in the middle, with. "I think I'm in love with Neon." and ending with "Actually I think she's been manipulating my feelings for a lot longer than that. And it might just be some sort of game to her. I want to think she feels something. That there's some sort of void that I'm filling for her, but knowing Neon I can't help but be afraid that that's not the case, and that I'm just another toy for her to amuse herself with for the time being then toss aside when the time comes."
"Actually," I say, "It's uh. Not. Really."

"That's it." Veruvi says. She folds her arms and settles into her seat.

"Is that too big for you?" Sen asks. "I can definitely take some of it off your hands."
My terrir9ry is the same as, uh, Carnix's right?
Maw grins and rubs his mouth with his hand.
"No, Ar-kahn." Iudex says.
"No, Ar-khan." Iudex says.
"No, Arkhan." Iudex says.
"The shit-eater, Losampha." Maw growls.
"Are you afraid of it?" Maw's mandibles click.
"Goddamn. What a fucking pain in the ass."
"Who killed Wohrrapath? Monad?" The Maw asks.
“If they were looking to take her spot they would have come to us, no? I almost find it a little disrespectful.”
Lady Wolf tilts her head “And what do you suppose we do with Ibsi’s killer when we do? Kill them?”
“And beyond that, who’s resources will we apply to that task? Frankly, it seems we’re all rather busy.”
Lady Wolf tilts her head “And what do you suppose we do with Ibsi when we do? Kill her?”
I left with9ut saying anything. For the sec9nd time. N9t sure h9w well she'd take that s9rt 9f thing.
Um. Kind 9f. S9rt 9f. I'm n9t sure right n9w, h9nestly.

Veruvi nods.
My name is Veruvi Salisk, captain 9f Ruin Wings.

"I think he just doesn't care."
"Well yeah."
"I've only seen him once. It was just for a bit."
"He kills everything."
"Well. He uh."
"But like. It's what he does that's scary."
"That breathes steam and.... It's not that scary to look at I guess. It's almost kind of silly."
"And he's got this skull mask."
"He's this.... Big, big, skinny, ugly looking motherfucker."
"Uh."
"We got slaughtered. Only Harrier and I made it out. And even then he slit my throat open. I wasn't able to talk for a while."
"We ran into the General on prodigia."
"They were great. It's been really depressing seeing them like that."
"Yeah!"
"Yeah!
"It's been like almost seven months."
"No, actually I'm great, Re and Fargo are up again!"
"Damn, that's too bad."
"Huh. I haven't had that... Did you take that to a doctor?"
"Not too fun."
"I've had those before."
"Ouch..."
"Hey Dir, how was your mission?" Porcea grins.
I step through the first circle. From inside, it looks like the lines of a ritual. From above, they most likely form a coherent shape. She's always had an eye for that sort of thing. She liked to look down from above at a collection of paintings and see something. It didn't really matter what.
The room is dark, lit by the dim light of electric torches placed in concentric circles through the rows and rows of paintings. 
The words are pristine and clear in my head. Yes. It's been long. Too long. Long enough for pain to grow dull and dry and dead and take root and sprout into other things.
Her skin is soft, smooth, legs limber, lithe, small, delicate. She hasn't been eating well, I can tell at a glance. Like me, she's been missing something. I take a step forward. Her eyes are bright green, for only a moment. She doesn't make any motions. She barely breathes.
The third layer is a blend of the second and the first. Complete forms, but with the viscera, the gore, the life is splayed out in front of it, spread all around. Bright colors. Intense. Like Neon. Intense, raw emotion.
Mizerkah's hair turns bright blue. Her eyes may have as well, but I can't see them. In Miz's world. Blue is joy. Bright, intense joy. Pink is excitement, opportunity. Black is anger, hate. White, clarity, death. Grey, sadness. Green, fear. Yellow, pain. Red is love.
Mizerkah's hair turns bright blue. Her eyes may have as well, but I can't see them. In Miz's world. Blue is joy. Bright, intense joy. Pink is excitement, opportunity. Black is anger, hate. White, clarity, death. Grey, sadness. Green, fear. Yellow, pain. Red is love. She never turns red. That color is for me.
She moves for the first time. Closing the gap between us, pressing up against me. Her skin against the cloth of my shirt. Her head against my chest. Her arms wrapped around my waist. Her warmth against the core of my stomach. And it's good. It's right, even. Like the universe has realigned and time begins once again to roll forward.
"Red." I correct her. "Red is fine."
&gt;Re-Haven.&lt;
"It's alright now, though."
&gt;I'm sorry.&lt;
&gt;It was much worse for you, wasn't it?&lt;
&gt;Forming fake lines.&lt;
&gt;Instead of running around.&lt;
&gt;I feel like I can live again.&lt;
&gt;But you're here now. With me.&lt;
Mizerkah's arms raise slightly. Arms spread, palms facing upward. The coat scrapes on itself as it bunches up at the shoulders. 
I'm sorry too. I should have done more. I could have paid more attention, but I didn't. I wasn't careful enough.
&gt;I'm sorry.&lt;
The words are pristine and clear in my head. Yes. It's been long. Too long. Long enough for pain to dull and dry and dead and take root and sprout into other things.
&gt;It's been a long time, for you, hasn't it...&lt;
Her skin is soft, smooth, legs limber, lithe, small, delicate. She hasn't been eating well, I can tell at a glance. Like me, she's been missing something as well. I take a step forward. Her eyes are bright green, for only a moment. She doesn't make any motions. She barely breathes.
Through the space is Mizerkah. Legs and chest bare, wearing my old, faded army coat. I gave it to her a long time ago. There's a sickly sweet smell that permeates the inside of this circle. It's heady, but not painfully so.
That's how I used to look. That's how I used to feel, when I was with her. I can have that.
I press further into the circle. The paintings become clearer, more complete, both in idea and execution. In one, I see a face that looks like mine, but more alive, more animated than I've seen myself looking in a long time.
I step through the first circle, from inside, it looks like the lines of a ritual. From above, they most likely form a coherent shape. She's always had an eye for that sort of thing. She liked to look down from above at a collection of paintings and see something. It didn't really matter what.
It's a little different from her first studio. It's missing all the chaos. Instead, it's carefully constructed, made to look chaotic. Each easel has been measured down to the millimeter in it's placement in the circles, spaced not in equal measure, but in equal unmeasure.
They're not worth it. They pale in comparison. Through the door, looking back, it's almost pitiful how worthless everything else is.
My hand reaches out, grasps the door, and throws it open. I enter, with force, hunger, throwing off the metaphorical hands, the metaphorical chains, the lines, the expectations, the relationships, the lifetimes.
Of course, in the end, I'm nothing if not a slave to my desires. 
I'm not too sure how I got there. It feels like a long combination of hazy unimportant events, and poor decisions that I didn't always get to make for myself.
I wasn't ready.

For the sake of keeping the metaphor-I need the metaphor, or it becomes too easy to make the wrong choice seem right or the right choice seem horrendous-for the metaphor's sake, we'll say there's also a hand tugging me, harshly, pulling me back away from the door. 
For the sake of the metaphor, we'll say there's a line that's stuck inside me, trying to pull me through that door. It's not tugging strongly, but it's insistent, and it's alluring, and sweet. Tender, gentle tugs. It feels almost like a trap, like the light on an angler fish, or the sweet aroma of a box of rat poison.... Or it would, if I didn't already know what's behind the door.
These forces are pulling me, violently, though nobody would be able to tell, back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and forth and back and back and forth. It's terrifying. It's a terrifying decision, and it's one I have to make. And I have to make it now.
I don't need to go through. I shouldn't go through, I know this. Through the door is wrong. It's full of obscene, terrible things, that shouldn't have happened and should never happen again. Things that could happen regardless, that I shouldn't be involved in, that I should prevent, I can prevent them, I might be the only one who can.

Behind the door is a lapse in judgment, It's a relapse into old habits, a pleasure so unique and exquisite I crave it like nothing I've ever craved before. I want it. That's what's scary. I want it terribly. Like nothing I've ever wanted before. I want it even more than I wanted it last time. But in order to have it I'll have to throw away everything. Every last thing I've gained over the years of not being Red. To go through that door means none of it was worth anything in the first place. It will invalidate a quarter of my existence. It'll expose the lies I've been telling myself about myself-telling everyone about myself-telling myself about everyone, everything. And I still want it.

It feels almost like a trap, like the light on an angler fish, or the sweet aroma of a box of rat poison.... Or it would, if I didn't already know what's behind the door.
I'm not too sure how I got there. It feels like a long combinations of hazy unimportant events, and poor decisions that I didn't always get to make for myself.
I'm standing in front of a doorway.
"Yes, I suppose I understand that." Qitara says, softly.
"Bounty hunting I'm bound to come across something with more uh.... Substance." She nods.
"You get me?" Eao smiles. "I just want more substance."
"Bounty hunting I'm bound to come across something with more uh.... Substance."
"Cage fighting's boring. Too much spectacle, not enough challenge." Eao shrugs. "These days I only accept fights from title holders, block out one day every six or so months, where they all get a chance to beat me."
"Why are you even trying to be bounty hunter?" Qitara frowns.
“I dont believe either of you.”
I dont believe either of you.
Qitara stares at the two of them.
“Well when you’re going on 150-0, still undefeated, they tend to lay it on fat.” Eao’s head bobs as she talks.
“Well when you’re going on 150-0, still undefeated, they tend to lay it on fat.”
“They say all that shit when she walks in the room. It’s nutty.” Liz says.
They say all that shit when she walks in the room. It’s nutty.
“The Blue Demon, The Champion Killer, Queen of the Cage, World Eater!” Liz raises her arms.
“It’s all true.”
“Dunno about the other stuff,” Liz chimes in, “But she’s got a stack full of reruns of her fights.”
Eao’s smile spreads to a grin.
“That’s ridiculous.” Eao begins to smile. “You can’t be a monk, a pirate, and a cage fighter.”
“That’s ridiculous. You can’t be a monk, a pirate, and a cage fighter.”
“Yep.”
“You’re a cage fighter.” Qitara narrows her eyes.
Eao nods.
“Your ring?” Qitara asks.
“Quick, but telegraphed. He was getting ready to throw a punch as soon as he took his first step. Big, heavy, planting his feet. You walk up like that in my ring and you’ll be on the ground faster than you can snap.”
“It was quick, I thought.” Qitara says.
“Boom. Right there, Liz, I’d have ended him. That jab was sooo careless.”
They stalk toward the center of the ring and one of them throws a jab to test the waters.
“This is the best part.” Eao says.
Then the match is beginning. The two dudes size each other up.
She doesnt say anything about that though.
Qitara doesn’t care for all the spectacle. It’s actually rather loud.
The lights flash and the crowd cheers as the fighters make their way to the ring.
"Shush. It's gonna start." Eao grins.
"Shoosh. It's gonna start." Eao grins.
"Shoosh. It's gonna start."
Eao has pinched Liz's big toe.
"Yeah it's pretty hot- OW!" Liz shouts.
"Yeah it's pretty hot- OW!"
"You're asking if I like watching muscular attractive dudes beat each other up?"
"When you put it like that... I guess not."
"And then get in close and hug, all sweaty like, and throw each other to the ground and mount one another and roll all over the floor, flailing around?"
"And then get in close and hug, all sweaty like, and throw each other to the ground and mount one another and roll all over the floor, flailing around."
Qitara blinks. "Well. Um..." 
Qitara blinks. "Well, Um..." 
You're asking if I like watching muscular attractive dudes beat each other up?"
Liz peers behind Eao's neck at Qitara.
"You like this sort of thing, Liz?" Qitara asks.
Liz passes a bowl of popcorn to Eao.
"You like this sort of thing, Liz?"
But she's none of those things, or maybe all of them. The lines are blurry, and it's hard to tell where one stops and the other begins. Confusing.
From Eao's own stories, Qitara would assume she would have learned to be an infinitely calm and incredibly collected student of peace and tranquility. 
It may not be the reason she hasn't returned yet. And it's definitely not the reason she hasn't been contacting Palanhin or Jaren for the past month and a half, but it's a factor.
It's an incredibly good thing. It means she's learning, which was the point of leaving Yon Oryx in the first place.
It's good!
There are a lot of things that Qitara doesn't expect.
Eao pats one thigh, and Liz's legs drop unceremoniously atop her own.
She gets it. She just doesn't like it.
Qitara had on a black sleeveless shirt and jeans, with a pair of silver bands around each of her biceps. The colors contrasted against her own bright skin. It leaves a little brain-imprint on the wall through the open door after she grips the doorframe and swivels on the ball of one foot into the hallway.
"Thank you."
"I suppose I'm going to go watch the television now." Qitara says slowly. "I'm glad we could help you with your room, Peridotto."
Peri feels like she might have done the same, but can't exactly tell.
Qitara meets Peri's eyes, then Kisket's.
"Be there. In a minute." She finishes.
"Be there. In a minute."
"I'll, um." Qitara blinks.
"I'll, um."
"I, uh, okay." Qitara replies.
Eao's eyes light up. "Yes! It's very interesting. There's actually a really good fight going on right now! Do you want to come watch?"
"Yeah! It's very interesting. There's actually a really good fight going on right now! Do you want to come watch?"
"I've seen it once, in the training room... It was pretty interesting. But I don't really watch television."
"Yes! On the television."
"Mixed Martial Arts? Like. On the television?" Qitara pipes up.
"Mixed Martial Arts? Like. On the television?"
Peri can't think of anything to say.
"So uh, do you girls like MMA?"
Zenithon has a similar charm, but it's less apparent.
You get a clear view of the yellow Pelus skies and the rooftops of all the shops and homes, with the power plant's tower in the background just beginning it's cooling process, with the first wisps of steam beginning to churn out of its many vents.
It does. They'd just moved Peri's bed so it sat in the center of the room, she has her nightstands with their lamps in the back, with her workbench, on the left, next to her, and her closet and dresser on the right next to Kisket.
It's the other recruit. "Wow, this looks great." Eao says.
"Hey!" Comes a warm call from the doorway.
And it's only made worse because-
She's jealous of Kisket.
Peri glances at Qitara. She's not jealous. She doesn't really feel much of anything toward the girl.
As things stand, she's...
After Peri got the first invitation, she'd gotten really excited at a chance to rekindle the connection between the two of them. To maybe be where Kisket is standing now, with Kisket in Qitara's place. She'd gotten her hopes up much too high.
She's self-assured, confident, happier... It's good, for her, Peri supposes. But it's a little painful.
It's easy to see as Kisket stands across the bed from her. Her back is straight, legs slightly parted, shoulders relaxed. Her head's tilted to rest lightly on Qitara's.
The last time she'd talked to Kisket before getting the invitation from Tracy was almost 4 months ago when she'd first moved to Zenithon. Peri had thought she'd noticed something a little off about her then, but here, talking to Kisket in Kisket's home, surrounded by Kisket's people. The differences are very apparent. They're distinctive and sharp, like something cut into shape. The only problem is that Peri doesn't quite know what shape that is.
Peri can't think of anything to say.  
As soon as Kisket's up, Qitara slips under the held arm and pulls it around her waist.
As soon as she's up, Qitara slips under the held arm and pulls it around her waist.
Kisket's toe pokes her again.
That's sorta crazy.
"Wow." Qitara says.
"Wow."
"Seven foot by three foot by six inches."
"Quartz." Peri sighs.
"So," Qitara asks. "The slab beneath the bed. What is it?"
She bumps the tip of Peri's sock with her toe.
Her legs stretch out under the bed. Her feet bump into Peri's.
"How was I supposed to know that he doesn't know what an inch is?" She says.
"How was I supposed to know that he doesn't know what an inch is?"
Next time you're gonna have to get cypress to do the whole job.
I'm never moving this thing again, you know that right?
Qitara, to Kisket's left is hunched over, hands braced on her knees breathing hard.
&gt;When you're waving your arm. Fuck, you've got so fucking many of them, just like pushing out from under your skin. Your arms are fucking vibrating with them.&lt;
Mars doesn't receive a response.
No, we won't, get out.
&gt;Well, we'll save it for later then.&lt;
&gt;Hm.&lt;
&gt;True.&lt;
&gt;True.&lt;
I've only seen it a couple times.
&gt;Lie.&lt;
I don't know what's in there.
&gt;Stress! Looks like I'm onto somethiiiing.&lt;
&gt;But why do you always waste so much time making pairs? It'd be much faster to just make one. Unless you've already got something in there.&lt;
&gt;It's a lot. It's a whole fucking lot. I can't even think about it.&lt;
Mars doesn't respond to that.
&gt;And then when you push out your hand they snap out and sew themselves into the air and just rip it apart. Wow. Do you know how many people I could kill with powers like that?&lt; 
&gt;There's gotta be millions. Tiny threads, like worms. Crawling around. It's fucking gross.&lt;
&gt;When you're waving your arm. Fuck, you've got so fucking many of them, just like pushing out from under your skin. Your arms fucking vibrating with them.&lt;
&gt;Yeah! Holy fuck. It's right in front of you.&lt;
&gt;Well if you pay attention, you can see how they work. Lemme watch that memory again.&lt;
&gt;But while it's different, It's not that different. Lots of oxium abilities work in similar ways.&lt;
&gt;Oxium works differently in everyone, and that goes past just the types.&lt;
&gt;Alright, let me dumb it down for you.&lt;
Fuck you. What the fuck are you talking about?
&gt;You must be some kind of an idiot! What a jackpot.&lt;
&gt;Holy shit. Holy shit. That's rich!&lt;
&gt;Don't tell me you haven't caught that yet.&lt;
I don't know what you're saying.
&gt;Threads! You've got the threads and the needles and you push them and pull them?&lt; 
&gt;I like it. The oxium thing. You do the same thread thing.&lt;
&gt;Yeah. I’m seeing everything. Probably better than you are.&lt;
God dammit.
Uti’s talking to the raptor.
&gt;Ohhh yea. I can stay here for as long as I want.&lt;
“You’re still in my head?” He thinks.
Mars looks over at Uti.
&gt;Oh, that was cool.&lt;
Through the hole, Mars can see the back and tail of a raptor. She's pounding on the locked door of a respawner.
A hole spreads open in the empty air. A similar one opens up in the room they'd just left.
Forcefully, Mars's left hand shoots out to the side.
"Let me know when to take the shot."
Tzez aims at the ship's engines.
"Me too."
"If you could go back, would you?"
"No test, nothing."
"Really though."
He turns off his helmet's audio recording.
"And do you like him?"
"So, I never asked, cause usually it's pretty personal, but how'd you get picked?"
"Time to go."
"Helps with the pre-mission jitters."
"Right. That's good."
"Want one, Anunda?"
"But I like it when people call me Najash. And the only one who does that is my sister."
"And hah, don't get me wrong, that's fuckin awesome."
"I can drop my guard around you guys, but to everyone else I've gotta be a faceless death machine."
"I guess. But like you can't ask them for their opinions. You can't ask for help. You can order them to back you up and make them run around for shit. But you can't drop your guard."
"It's usually with other Chromatin."
"Yeaaaah, but I never go on missions with Him."
"I like to be able to uhh see eye to eye with my teammates."
"And it's like. Man, I've never been a huge fan of the commander/commandee relationship."
"Plus it's much easier to get around as a unit of two."
"I like not having them in the way, for the most part." Tzez says.
"Reticles are a hassle."
Aradia's grip is too tight, or maybe his pulls are too weak, he can't quite tell.
Except he can't let go. 
Behind them, there's a chain-link fence, with a hole in it.
Aradia's looking through the leaves, at a cloud-filled sky.
They're standing on a rocky river bank in broad daylight, beneath the shade of a heavy tree.
y0u're crazy.
She's looking up.
Aradia's eyes are open already.
Her head bobs side to side, her hair pressing into his face, the grapefruit smell enveloping his senses, It's silky and soft and Mars presses back into it until he taps his forehead into the back of her head.
Aradia's smirk reaches her eyes. She squints, teeth flash in another quick grin, breaths quick, stronger, louder.
He feels his neck snap to the right, then back just as quickly. The singer's voice grows more impassioned as the piano joins back in.
Her hair brushes his nose as she turns her head. It's so long.
Mars has to walk backwards a bit, back toward the center of the living room.
A short horn solo. They stand there, swaying, hand in hand. Mars' mind screams at him, but it's muffled, like the voice is covered by a heavy blanket, pressed all around it.
She smirks, watching Mars cross the room.
She's grinning, looking at his feet.
Aradia's head and shoulders join into the sway.
He doesn't move a muscle.
Mars knows this. He understands he shouldn't be here. He needs to get up, go home, and call her later to apologize.
Mars' eyes move at a million miles an hour. There's way too much exposed. Almost. Way too much potential for way too much to be exposed. It's bad. It's not good. Very, very not good.
She's wearing a black loose fitting halter top and similarly black tightish harem pants.
alm0st d0ne, d0n't w0rry.
yeah? it's 0ld-earth afr0beat. i thought you might like it.
She disappears around the corner. Moments later, the music changes to a funky guitar rhythm with some shakers. Some kind of latin sounding thing. Mars' head inadvertently starts to bob.
Aradia smirks. "Sure," she says, "I'll change it."
I just uh, dont know how in the mood I am for freaking out.
Mars nods
She shakes her head, whipping her hair around for emphasis.
0h, its alright. i like h0w it makes you wanna just freak 0ut, y0u kn0w?
-kind of music.
Aradia’s head pokes out of the doorframe of her room
I asked if you liked this-
Aradia's voice calls out from the other room.
what'd y0u say?
"What'd you say?" Aradia shouts in response.
You like this kind of music?!
{ Sirie - 6 }
She breathes in.
She feels the punch of a rifle barrel between her shoulder blades.
A chain-link fence extends fifty feet into the air in front of her. Guard towers spaced evenly, skirting the grounds.
She's at a remote army prison camp somewhere in the Qinxhao territory.
The back doors open and grey even daylight floods the van's back chamber.
The van isn't moving. She can hear footsteps in gravel outside.
She's strapped into a plastic seat in the back of a metal van. Her hands and feet are cuffed.
Sirie blinks away a throbbing in the back of her head.
Sirie lies in the grass in the shade of the trees. Her head rests on her arm, Her eyes locked into the crook of her elbow. A light breeze picks up stray strands of her hair, splayed out across her shoulders and against the small of her back. It catches the leaves above, making the specks of sunlight shiver across her skin.
Sirie hears the soft wisp of flattening grass as the one next to her stirs. A hand brushes the back of her arm, glides up to her shoulder, trickles up her neck and embeds itself into her hair. She shivers. The hands are cool to the touch and the fingers press gently as they rub up and down along the base of her scalp. The hand begins to pull away; Sirie groans. She presses her neck back toward the sensation, but it lifts off her anyway. Almost immediately, it’s replaced by a warm, wet breath on her ear. A voice whispers to her.
 “There you are... Oh, you’re so selfish. Never stopping to let me catch up to you...”
 A hand brushes her hair out of the way.
“Just a little longer ‘till I’ll have you in my grasp again.”
{ Sirie - 6 }
He gets a muffled grunt in response.
Tracy sighs.
no. that's not a funny joke.
how do we end these team meetings, am i supposed to be all like 'alright fellas, good work, meeting adjourned' or does everyone just walk away like usual?
that's good.
I guess it's fine.
I didn't realize you'd invited Peridotto.
i mean, i liked all four, but i doubt the dudes'll keep up.
The winners stay, the losers walk away without comment
Eao mops the floor with Cypress, Liz locks M’hzet in a choke hold, Peri takes Tracy out in one shot, and Bos couldn’t lay a finger on Qitara.
Tracy nods.
There's a tall, muscular Joquin, auburn fur with light spots covering his exposed arms and neck. He carries a massive pistol, the length of M'hzet's entire arm.
She's got a long fashionable white cloak over her shoulders. Tracy almost remembers her name is Peridotto.
There's a familiar big-eyed alien girl with a rifle that extends to be longer than she is tall, she flips it upright and leans on it like a staff. 
There's a familiar big-eye'd alien girl with a rifle that extends to be longer than she is tall, she flips it upright and leans on it like a staff. 
He's got a shiny silver plated rifle, wrapped in copper wire along the barrel, that looks like he polishes daily. He says his name is M'hzet.
There's a short, grey skinned male Demmate, with short black hair covering most of his face.
She's wearing a sleeveless shirt that's been wrapped over by layers of cloth, held in place by a belt. The cloth dangles between her legs in the front and back. She introduces herself as Eao with a small bow.
There's a female Shovie, long legged, light blue skinned, with flat wide hands and and a sharp, angular face.
"I think it's an excellent idea."
and of course you'd get the final verdict.
i'm not gonna let a bunch of noobies join up, especially with the kind of missions we go on.
it's only try-outs right now.
Qitara squeezes Tracy's shoulder before standing up straight.
you've been dealing with a lot of shit
don't take this the wrong way
is how the fuck i'm gonna tell shanta.
should be in about an hour and a half now. I've already asked to clear out the training room.
Should be in about an hour and a half now. I've already asked to clear out the training room.
i got four applicants that all want to come over for try-outs.
Wha- you can't just say that.
veruvi's not fucking coming back.
Isn't it still a little too soon? We still have Veruvi and.
yeah. i decided to post another ad, cause. well. we've got a lot of vacancies now.
i'm uh looking over a couple recruit applications.
I'm uh looking over a couple recruit applications.
"What are you doing?" Qitara asks.
She doesn't resist as Qitara grabs her by the hand and pulls her over to Tracy, falls into place when Qitara guides her behind to look over his shoulder.
Qitara laughs, lightly. "You've been staring at Tracy so seriously. It looked weird."
A good friend would have stopped him at the two minute mark, but, honestly it's so weird that she can't really decide on any particular course of action.
Kisket's been watching him do this from the kitchen for ten minutes.
Every once in a while, he'll swap tabs and grin, before typing, then swap straight back and shift tones completely.
Tracy sit's hunched over on the couch, frowning at his tablet.
Those days were the second happiest she'd ever seen Red.
Neon's brush hits the canvas.
Neon looks back at her current work, then at Kate. They make eye contact. Kate's mouth spreads into a shy smile. 
&gt;You're so thoughtful.&lt;
"You complain constantly about feeling cramped and antsy inside the ship. I thought you might want to get some fresh air? Relatively fresh."
&gt;Why?&lt;
&gt;Hmm. Sure.&lt; 
"Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, I was going to go to Zenithon in a few days to pick up a hard drive from my house. You want to come with, Neon?"
&gt;Keep it.&lt;
She's picked out a painting of an amphiron's skeletal and muscular structure after it had been cut in half vertically. After painting out the body, Neon disguised it with nearly random splashes of black and red and blue and yellow, with slashes of white layered on top of the mess.
"Oh," Tobin says, breaking Neon out of her thoughts. "I like this one a lot."
It also gave her a name to follow. And someone's family to kill.
Neon thanks Vica often for giving her oxium, but she doesn't think it'll ever be often enough.
Red didn't like babies, and she didn't like children. Which makes sense, Red didn't like people who were stupid. 
A couple times, Neon and red had flown with Oryx back to his home. Yon Ir-yut. Neon got to play with Oryx's daughter, Eir. She had just turned two years old.
Sometimes he showed up when there weren't any Ahmkara to hunt. Sometimes he was there just to be there.
When Neon was fourteen she used to wait until everyone had left, then crawl into Red's lap and lick the missed droplets from her chin and collar and chest. She'd fall asleep and wake up with her head in Red's arms.
When they'd hunt down and kill the Snake King or whatever he called himself for the third time, and they'd have a feast with their whole rag-tag army and Red would sit in the back, drinking every last drop of the dead king's angry black blood.
Those days were the second happiest, she'd ever seen Red.
She remembers a lot about the time she spent with them: Red, and Oryx, and the rest.
And there's nobody dependable enough to be an Oryx. 
She doesn't like anyone on the Marche Slave quite enough for that.
Neon doesn't know where she'll find those two, though.
Neon isn't really paying attention to them. She paints another stroke of Kate's long exposed leg, dangling off the lounge.
Kate answers a question from Lin-sho
Kate answers a question from Lin'Sho
Kate answers a question from Lin'so
She just needs someone for Oryx and Kazchke, and everything'll be perfect.
She's got a Sholas, a Hasha, a Euridime.
She's getting pretty close to the right picture.
It's very fulfilling to be able to have her little circle gathered in her room.
She's added a bit of furniture to it.
"Good," Lord Wolf says.
"Wolves." Says the man next to Veruvi.
"Weapons."
"Weapons.
"Tools."
"The universe's sculptors."
"We are the chosen few."
"We are the many."
"Welcome to the Great Ahmkara Hunt."
All pairs stand.
"Welcome"
"Talis ao Zelen"
"Welcome, Etainien Mer Yenzen," everyone says.
"Meet Etainien Mer Yenzen, of Eshalia." She says.
That pair sits, Lady Wolf's pair stands.
"Welcome Vasha-en." Veruvi says with the choir.
"I bring Vasha-en of Avsol Theta." The voice that speaks belongs to a man. It's smooth, confident, loud.
That pair sits, the another stands, Veruvi can't see their faces at all.
"Welcome Simon," The voices say. Veruvi finds her own voice joining in with the others.
"Welcome Simon," The voices say. Veruvi finds her own voice joining in with the others.
That pair sits. Another stands. Veruvi can't see their faces whatsoever.
"Siniseka Ir Menet Oryndezen Naradzire, or Simon, of Yak'djinn." The bounty hunter says.
His voice is deep gravely, like he's growling. Very familiar.
To the left of Veruvi another pair stands. She can make out the tall one's long snout in the light. 
"Welcome, Veruvi Salisk." A choir of voices say in unison.
"I introduce Veruvi Salisk, of Ipo-Rakaikon."
The man next to Veruvi stands. Veruvi stands quickly after. 
"Lord Wolf?" She says, "Would you do us the honor?" 
"It's good to see you all." Lady Wolf's familiar, warm voice coos from the other side of the room. "We all know why we're here. Lets begin." She lifts a hand toward Veruvi.
There are ten people in total. With the lighting in the back, it's very hard to see their faces.
Veruvi's guide sits, and she takes her seat next to him.
"Why wasn't I notified of these decisions as they were being made?" Faye asks.
"It was a matter of national security, and the council unanimously agrees that your opinions on the matter are compromised, to put it lightly." The phone responds.
"It was a matter of national security, and the council unanimously agrees that your opinions on the matter are compromised, to put it lightly." 
"Why wasn't I notified of these decisions as they were being made?"
"End of report, ma'am."
"Investigations into the issue are currently underway, and those two along with any future suspects will remain in court custody until they are complete."
"Twenty four hours after that, the traitor Zazani Xhorin was arrested and a team was sent to Zenithon to bring Sirie Rhae into custody. She came willingly."
"We don't know where they currently are."
"Reports so far say that all of Salisk's remaining supporters have left on the three ships."
"About thirty minutes prior to that, we received a transmission of a Zenithon ferry arriving in that area. This led the council to believe that Salisk's daughter, whom we have on record as living full-time on Zenithon, came to Ipo and initiated this launch."
The voice on the phone has an air of poorly restrained calm, a restricted, forced professionalism that's very clearly apparent.
"Okay. Read the report again?"
{ Mars - 6 }
Mars walks back out of the teleporter.
"Hey guys," he waves.
Tracy looks up and frowns.
Mars walks through the teleporter.
------------------------------
Sirie leaves.
They go practice 9 pillar combat training for three hours.
Mars greets Sirie at the Visitor's Hangar.
-----------------------------
thanks.
I- don't know. You listen really well.
then why did y0u ask?
You can do whatever you want, it's just like uhh, I don't want you to feel like you've gotta feel bad for me. That's not why I asked if I could vent to you or anything?
i can't feel s0rry that y0u're unhappy?
What? Why? It's got nothing to do with you.
i'm s0rry...
It is!
that must be frustrating.
I'm trying to be considerate but like. What the fuck. I didn't get any kind of notice. I just showed up and her friend Kisket told me she had up and disappeared.
Fifteen days is no longer a couple.
Not weeks.
Days.
I don't get it. She left a note that said she'd be back in a couple of days.
Like, I'm lucky it's been working since I cut my off days short, but eventually it's not going to fly.
Mars shoves a piece of broccoli in his mouth.
This is the fourth time I've been there in two weeks.

Kisket looks up and frowns.
Hey guys, he waves.
Mars walks through the teleporter.
{ Mars - 6 }
The Zachthazel has a normal voice, it sounds a bit like he tries too hard to be pleasant, though.
"Things are going well. Word finally reached me that we're no longer doing business with Luden's precipice and that the city's new leader is instead dealing almost exclusively with GP. I'm going to look into it."
The Zachthazel re-folds his hands on the table.
The Tzezeren's voice is lighter than the Saccharum's, yet similarly gravely. He isn't very loud, but he speaks clearly and confidently enough to appear so.
"I don't think any pirates will be coming back there."
"The Ethyrian and I took out everything even remotely related to Horror Squad on Crii."
The Tzezeren has his arms folded over his head.
The Ophidiate's voice is bright, spritely, and surprisingly animated. Especially for one who doesn't seem to talk very much.
"The time off has been good. I'm prepared for my next assignment, sir."
The Ophidiate flexes her fingers behind her head.

Goregok's death and the execution of the Varfalque has left Zacht with mountains of work to do. Meetings to show up at, crowds to reassure on public stages, backers to regain, investors to take care of, documents to write, sign, send to arkhan, send to losampha, send to rest of the chromatin who are never around and who don't answer their fucking doors, send to the relations office secretaries, send to the various council members, send to the fucking press, send to his fucking mom, send to his shitty fans. Buy supplies, buy council votes, buy more supplies, weapons, ammunition, armor for the new recruits, buy dog food, buy dog treats, a better collar. Order another shipment of oxium, order four new training dummies in the oxium test center, order more food from Awakazi because Awakazi cuisine is the new big thing for some reason, order two new lounge chairs for the rec center, order cleaning supplies, order office supplies, order more of those bones and another squeak toy since Bruma-o tore the last one to shreds...

"Alright, fine." The Ophidiate stands. "But this is the last time, okay? Lets go."
Zacht thinks for a bit, then nods. "Yeah, I wanna take my dog for a walk with you."
Edited previous message: "So what did you want, dude? Want me to walk your dog with you? At 2 in the morning? You wanna take your dog for a walk?" Ophi asks.
"So what did you want, dude? Want me to walk your dog with you? At 2 in the morning? You wanna take your dog for a walk?"
She laughs a bit.
The Ophidiate smiles as well.
Zacht smiles.
"I wasn't actually supposed to pretend that you meant what you said about not liking me, was I? Cause look at me, I'm not a professional actor."
"I don't think I've ever heard more obvious sarcasm."
"Ooph." Ophi flinches. Her hands cover her heart, she keels over in her chair. "Ahh.... That hurts, Zacht."
"Nobody who I like."
"Oh are you feeling lonely now? Nobody to talk to?"
"So everyone's occupied..." The Zachthazel scratches his chin.
"They've been done for a little while too."
"They've been there for a little while."
The Ophidiate nods, "Yep. He's probably trying to put the 'moves' on her again. God, I'm embarrassed for him from the other side of the galaxy."
"Completely false. Is Tzezeren still on Crii with Ethyrian?"
He's not going to admit that though.
She's right.
The Zachthazel opens his mouth and words don't come out.
Edited previous message: "Statistically, your dog and all the things involved in caring for him is a bigger tax on your mental health than he is a benefit to it."
"Statistically your dog and all the things involved in caring for him is a bigger tax on your mental health than he is a benefit to it."
"It is bad. It's not efficient. It doesn't make sense."
"How could you say something that? That's like me calling Bruma a useless animal."
The Ophidiate's right hand flies to her mouth in mock-surprise.
"Your system is bad."
"Yes. I've got a system. Stop trying to fuck it."
"Oh so now we get the truth. Ophi's gotta have everything perfect and orderly for her so she can feel safe."
"I don't trust anyone else to do it right." Ophi folds her arms.
"We can get a variety of bullets for you. That's not a problem."
"Plus, I like having the variety. I like having different bullet types: different effects and effect variations, different points for varying levels of penetration, calibers, density. I also mark them all myself so I know which they are."
Now the Zachthazel takes his turn to eye-roll.
"I like casting though. It's relaxing."
"No, seriously. It's such a time-sink. You'll have so much free time on your hands when I'm done it'd be like being on vacation."
Ophi rolls her eyes.

The Ophidiate's workbench is in the back of the room, by her bed. She keeps her weapon rack next to that. Zacht looks at the red-bladed knives, placed carefully in their spots. Her hatchet enshrined at the top of the rack.
Edited previous message: He pulls the chair from her desk to his left and sits in it.
Edited previous message: "Hey, you're up late." She says.
He pulls the chair from her desk and sits in it.
Zacht shrugs.
"Hey, you're up late."
The Ophidiate glances over, then pulls out her earphones and spins her chair around to face him.
Zacht heads inside and knocks on the wall.
She and her brother are alike in that way, they just don't care about inefficiencies.
A while ago, he calculated just how much time she spends doing that. It's an atrocious amount of time and energy she's wasting. He doesn't see the point.
Ophi's at her workbench. The lamp there is the only light on in her room. She's wearing earphones while casting bullets.
He looks through the door.
Zacht heads over.
He couldn't call it a healthy schedule, but at least she's consistent with it.
Except the Ophidiate's, of course, she goes to sleep at five in the morning and wakes up at four in the afternoon.
All of the doors are closed.
Zacht opens his door and steps into the main chamber.
He takes his jacket off the coat hangar, just in case.
A glance at his watch tells him it's 2:24 in the morning.
He heads to the door.
He considers going for a walk.
Then he pushes his chair back and stands.
He yawns.
Even if that toughness is mostly mental.
The Zachthazel considers himself the toughest chromatin.
Yes.
LAMEST! The nerve!
And to top it all off, doing it all without any recognition. Being considered the lamest chromatin.
Slogging through piles of menial bullshit and talking to people who don't understand half of the things they're raving about.
The rest of the chromatin would have killed themselves by now if they'd been put in his shoes.
It's a good thing he actually likes his job.
Goregok's death and the execution of the Varfalque has left Zacht with mountains of work to do. Meetings to show up at, crowds to reassure on public stages, backers to regain, investors to take care of, documents to write, sign, send to arkhan, send to losampha, send to rest of the chromatin who are never around and who don't answer their fucking doors, send to the relations office secretaries, send to the various council members, send to the fucking press, send to his fucking mom, send to his shitty fans.

He stretches his arms behind his head.
Zacht smiles a bit to himself.
Edited previous message: Luckily, he doesn't drool like Ophi.
Luckily he doesn't drool.
His head was lying on a missive he had yet to sign.
It's covered in paperwork.
Zacht looks at his desk.
He looks much more comfortable than Zacht is. Moving him now would be a crime.
His dog is curled up in the center of his bed.
Zacht looks around.
"Ugh...."
Leans back in his chair.
He sits up.
His neck is sore, his back is sore, his legs, feet.
He groans.
He had to have fallen asleep at his desk. His head is on his table, the right side of his face, stiff and sore as all hell.
The Zachthazel wakes up.
{ The Hunted - 7 }
{ Mars - 5 }
The stone in his palm rises slowly into the air.
At the fence and the forest and the things between the trees.
At the stone in his hand.
He looks at the river.
Edited previous message: He sits down.
He sits downs.
Mars walks over to the tree.
The skulls remain within the forest. They watch from between the trees.
He crosses the river.
Edited previous message: Halfway through he stops to pick up a single round stone from inside the water.
Halfway through he stops to pick up a single round stone from inside the watter.
Its shallow.
Edited previous message: He wades through the river.
He wades across the river.
He steps into the water.
Mars' right eye twitches.
There's a large tree on the other side, and behind it a chain-link fence covered in ivy and thistles.
The water is filled with small, smooth rocks and pebbles.
The river bank on this side is muddy, rocky, and thick with tree roots. The other side looks more suitable. With sand and grass in a shallow slope.
He's alone, he expected as much.
He steps through the trees and looks at the scene before him.
The horse and the cow follow.
He heads toward the river.
It's not very warm.
He feels the sunlight on his head.
Mars can hear the trickle of water, the rustle of leaves.
The horse looks at him, then at the river.
Mars turns, only to see the cow bearing down at him.
The portal closes behind him.
Mars crawls out of the bed and slowly follows it inside.
The horse-goat backs up more, receding into the portal.
He pushes himself up.
The skull's black mass backs away, giving Mars space to move.
It stares back.
He stares into its dull eyes.
Its antlers stretch straight up and outward from its head, rather than back like the cow.
The skull of a horse? Or maybe a goat.
He's face to face with a white skull.
Creeping along the edges of his vision, he looks back.
All around, stretching across the planes of his room, he sees the long oily black arms inch around him, trapping, suffocating.
He takes his eye off the portal for a moment.
It's much darker than it was a couple minutes ago.
He didn't notice.
It's dark.
...
...
Skin tingling, waiting for something to step through.
Instead he watches the corners, the edges.
He didn't look any longer than that.
Edited previous message: There was a thin forest with trees like twigs.
Edited previous message: It was about noon.
Edited previous message: Through the trees he could see the beginnings of a riverbed.
Through the trees he can see the beginning of a riverbed.
It's about noon.
There's a thin forest with trees like twigs.
He looked inside on accident.
The portal doesn't go to any place he's aware of.
So instead he lies awake and watches it.
Mars can't close it.
Big enough to walk through.
There's a portal at the foot of the bed, it's been there for hours.
Sometime between 2:00 and 5:00
It's late.
Mars lies awake in bed.
---------------------------------
Mars raises a hand and leaves without saying anything more.
He takes the weapon out of the cabinet.
Mars stands.
Thank you.
Mars nods again.
"I made a few patchy modifications. It should work with your psionics now. You should take it to the firing range to really get a feel for it though."
"That oxium weapon you asked me to research for you."
She points at a cabinet behind and to the right of Mars.
"Oh, wait- uh..." Set covers her mouth with her hands.
Mars nods.
"You can go if you want."
Okay.
"I don't know what to say about that."
Set leans back. Her shoulders sag.
"I don't know."
Mars' gaze alternates between his hands, the floor and Set's untouched notepad.
Neither of them say anything for a while.
Set sits back down.
Mars closes the portal.
"You can close it."
Set sighs, mostly to herself.
She wipes the remainder of the oil off her hand.
She takes a cloth from the tabletop.
She walks back to her desk.
She stands back up.
She lets it drip slowly off her fingertips and back through the portal.
Edited previous message: She watches as a handful of clear water from inside, turns thick and black as it's brought out.
She watches as a handful of clear water from inside, turns thick and black as it's brought  out.
Cupping her hand, Set brings it back out.
She takes her left hand off the edge and dips it in.
Her mouth opens slightly.
She looks deeper.
She can feel the fingers lick her palms.
She leans closer, carefully placing her hands along the edges of the portal.
Set's eyes narrow.
She looks at him for a moment, confirmation. She turns her head down and looks inside.
He looks up at her.
She walks over to Mars.
Set stands.
It's covering the majority of his lap now. Set watches as the nothing around the edges creeps out to prod at the realities it's bridging, like fingers, investigating.
The expansion of the portal happens in short spurts, always staying in tune with Mars' strained breathing.
Set watches the edge, it quivers and drips away into nothing on either end.
Set follows Mars' gaze. He's staring at the bottom edge, closest to him. Still refusing to look inside.
The portal widens more, the gap grows deeper.
Set notices the glance, but doesn't say anything.
Mars glances up at her, then returns his attention to the portal.
Her breaths are shallow and quick as she watches Mars and the widening gap that's forming between his hands.
Set drums the fingertips of her right hand against the arm of her chair.
{ Mars - 5 }
{ Neon - 10 }
She wakes up in the middle of the night and stares at the ceiling for five hours.
That same night, Neon dreams of burrowing her face into long red hair, and running her hands along silky smooth skin, and pressing herself into Red's warm back.
{ Horror Squad - Lin Sho }
"Oh FUCK!"
Then it hits her.
Lin Sho lies in her new Horror Squad bed after a long night of partying with Neon, Kate, and Tobin.
Two weeks later, Lin Sho is a member of Horror Squad.
...
"Fine, okay. We'll bet on it."
Lin frowns.
&gt;We can make a bet on it.&lt;
"Bullshit."
&gt;You just do everything I say for like, lets say two weeks. And by the end of those two weeks you'll be a member of Horror Squad.&lt;
"How?"
&gt;Oh yeah? I can fuckin show you.&lt;
"... I don't think that's true..."
Edited previous message: &gt;Well yeah. Fighting is all about how you think. It doesn't matter what you do.&lt;
&gt;Well yeah. Fighting is all about how you think. It doesn't matter what you do.
Neon nods.
"...It... Will?"
&gt;Yeah it'll be easy.&lt;
"Really?!"
&gt;I guess I can do that.&lt;
She looks over her shoulder at Lin Sho.
Neon stops.
"But um, I was just wondering if you could teach me how to fight like you do."
"I see..."
Neon nods.
"An oxium knife?"
&gt;No, I have a jacket with one knife, that makes copies of itself.&lt;
"You have a jacket that's filled with knives..."
Lin squints.
&gt;That's pretty edgy.&lt;
"Short swords, that I hide in my sleeves."
&gt;What kind.&lt;
"Well," Lin starts slowly, "I specialize in swords."
&gt;What did I do to get myself a fangirl? You know I've always wanted one. I've had followers, but never any fangirls.&lt;
&gt;So.&lt;
Lin doesn't waste time following her.
Neon motions for Lin to follow and starts off down the hallway.
&gt;I like people, but not that much.&lt;
&gt;You run into too many people.&lt;
"Uh-"
&gt;Come with me, I don't like standing around here.&lt;
Lin shifts uncomfortably.
&gt;This is new, though. I don't have any fans yet.&lt;
She smiles a bit.
&gt;Just Neon. That miss or ma'am shit makes it sound bad.&lt;
Neon nods slowly.
Neon looks at this girl from head to toe. She's wearing a little black officers cap that sort of sits between her pointy owl ears, and a long, loose, green shirt to make room for her thick feathery arms.  She's not wearing pants, or shoes for that matter, which is fine, pants are overrated anyway.
"I'm officer Lin. After that fight between you and miss Velitasera, think I may be a fan of yours."
Neon doesn't respond.
She turns to face an owl-looking alien, with massive eyes and long eyebrows that extend off the sides of its head.
Neon turns around.
"Excuse me miss... Neon? Is that what I'm supposed to call you?"
{ Horror Squad - Lin Sho }
Wait, no she's not.
The door closes behind Neon, and she's alone in the hallway.
She says goodbye before she heads through the door, like a normal person.
After Kate promises to come by to see the finished paintings of her, Neon leaves.
A really long time.
They talk for a long time.
Neon is sitting in a chair next to her.
She's lying on her bed.
Kate's recovering in her room.
{ Neon - 10 }
"They're all varying shades of grey, and frankly, I think the pirates could use a grey like yours. A voice like yours. They'll listen, too. There's a specific kind of respect there that you don't garner anywhere else."
"Think long and hard about what you want. What you want to do. What options you have and what opportunities you'll gain down the road."
"I don't know his whole reasoning, but I suspect he gave it to you because he wanted the final choice to be yours, and he didn't trust his followers to follow through with his wishes."
Softly, Veruvi approaches.
The aquarium is totally void of people.
"It's complicated, and I'm sure we'll find time to converse about it another day."
{ Veruvi - 11 }
Veruvi stands.
"I'm not sure if you knew this, but I sincerely love to talk."
She turns a bit to look at Veruvi.
"I have this aquarium to myself for a while longer. I feel the urge to enjoy my time here. If you'd like to join me, I would be delighted for the company."
Lady Wolf stands and walks toward the glass.
She retracts the hand.
"Think about it. For yourself."
"It's your decision, though."
Lady Wolf reaches out and lays a hand on Veruvi's arm.
"They're all varying shades of grey, and frankly, I think the pirates could use a grey like yours. A voice like yours. They'll listen, too. There's a specific kind of respect that you don't garner anywhere else."
"Pirates aren't innately evil, just like Monad isn't innately good, and the Government of the People isn't innately fair, and bounty hunters aren't innately mean and greedy."
"Think long and hard about what you want. What you want to do. What your options you have and opportunities you'll gain down the road."
"I don't want anyone to have good reason to hurt you or your loved ones." Lady Wolf looks back at the fish. "Neither do you I presume."
"Sometime soon, when you've made up your mind, you'll need to return to Lord Salisk's Citadel. You'll need to bring that key one way or the other."
A shiver runs down Veruvi's spine.
"You, Veruvi."
The mask turns to face Veruvi. She feels Lady Wolf looking into her eyes.
...And the 9ther?
"One is his ship."
"He made two spectacular things, though."
"He was a great man, but not a great pirate. That's important to note." Lady Wolf sighs. "Many people who had high hopes for him were disappointed."
"I don't know his whole reasoning, but I suspect he gave it to you, because he wanted the final choice to be yours, and he didn't trust his followers to follow through with his wishes."
"That trinket he gave you, that you're wearing around your neck," Lady Wolf says, tilting her head, "it's the key to his ship. And his people need it."
"This was recent, of course, only after you came back to him of your own volition."
"Your father specified you as his successor."
"Now. Here's the main issue."
"They're people. Powerful people, of course, but not evil, and definitely not all that legendary."
"Just because he was a pirate doesn't mean he was wrong. Or that he was evil. I'm not evil. Most of the lords aren't."
Veruvi doesn't respond.
She takes a moment.
"Surprising, I know. I supposed the best way to inform you would be to hit you with the worst parts right from the start."
Veruvi's brow furrows. Her mouth opens slightly, but no sound comes out.
"Well, for starters, your father was was a pirate lord."
What a69ut him.
"We came here to talk about your father, so lets talk about your father."
"Anyway!"
Veruvi nods.
"Vox is surprisingly good at uncovering information."
"It's how I know about most things."
That's h9w y9u knew a69ut my dad.
"Together? A team? A duo? Is he the brawn to my brains? The lord to my lady? Yes. More or less."
Y9u and him are like...
S9rry, this is taking a 6it t9 sink in...
Uh.
Veruvi gets the feeling Lady Wolf is smiling, despite her mask not having a mouth.
"It's complicated, and I'm sure we'll find time to talk converse about it another day."
"No, no. Not a pirate, at least not in the traditional sense."
S9 y9u're...
9h.
"It's because he is my husband. Rather, he wears his because I'm his wife."
"It's an honest question. No need to be shy about it." Lady Wolf says.
Veruvi nods.
"Like the one Vox Mortis wears?"
Wh-why d9es that mask l99k like-
Yeah...
Uh.
"It's a pleasure to finally meet you."
"You must be Veruvi." She says, voice full of warmth.
Clearly female, she's wearing a long dress that boarders on a robe. It's white with black highlights, black fur along the lining, and red silk on the inside of the collar. She's wearing a long mask with six eyes.
The person turns.
Uh. Hell9, are y9u...
Softly, Veruvi approaches
She doesn't wonder for long though, because she spots someone in white sitting alone on a bench.
A little excessive...
Veruvi wonders for a moment if Lady Wolf had bought out the building specifically for their meeting. 
The aquarium is totally void of people
She decides to walk around and look at the fish.
She arrives with time to spare.
Veruvi heads to The Pupil. They were going to meet at an aquarium restaurant hybrid. Apparently Lady Wolf likes fish.
She pulls out her phone. She had received a text from a hidden number that had a location and a time in it. She was five minutes early.
She makes a right and heads toward the main elevator.
Veruvi takes off and runs down the Zenithon street.
"I guess... Hey!"
Yeah well, y9u're weird sometimes.
"I called him yesterday though, wouldn't it be weird to call him again today?" Sirie frowns.
And if y9u d9n't want t9 d9 that, y9u can call Mars again with more less9ns. Y9u were super int9 that.
Sirie chuckles lightly. "It's fine."
Veruvi shrugs, "Well... Uh... Yeah, I guess so..."
"And you're just telling me now?"
Edited previous message: Well I guess, maybe. But Qitara likes every9ne. And she likes y9u m9re than m9st. She t9ld me s9 the 9ther day. She said: "Ah, a m9ment, Veruvi? I just wanted t9 say, Y9ur m9ther Sirie is spectacular, a l9t 9f fun t9 6e ar9und. I didn't get a chance t9 tell her earlier, w9uld y9u d9 s9 f9r me?"
Edited previous message: "She does? I haven't spoken much with her."
Edited previous message: G9 hang 9ut with Qitara! She l9ves y9u.
Well I guess. But Qitara likes every9ne, and Kisket Likes any9ne Qitara likes.
"They do? I haven't spoken much with them."
G9 hang 9ut with Kisket and Qitara! They l9ve y9u.
"That's not a good joke," she smiles. "I'll see you in a bit. Don't know what I'm gonna do with myself until then, but I'll see you."
Sirie laughs.
Y9u w9rry way t99 much, Sirie. I've 6een living here f9r a while, y9u kn9w. I pr96a6ly kn9w h9w t9 handle myself here even 6etter than y9u d9.
It's been three days since Lady Wolf called her. She received a text earlier that morning.
"Yeah, definitely." She smiles, she doesn't know why she's lying to Sirie.
Veruvi finishes putting her boots on.
Edited previous message: It's fine, I'll be back in a c9uple h9urs. I just want s9me al9ne time, I wanted to may6e 6uy a sniper rifle, like Verita6le's.
"Alright," Sirie says, "okay. If you want my opinion on anything, don't hesitate to call me."
It's fine, I'll be back in a c9uple h9urs. I just want s9me al9ne time, I wanted to buy a sniper rifle, like Veritable's.
{ Veruvi - 11 }
"As long as you know how to capitalize on any and all opportunities, If you're the first person to throw dirt in the other person's eyes, or hit them with a rock on the ground, or a piece of junk or something, or if you suckerpunch them before the fight even starts, you'll win no matter what."
It's a transfer call from Sirie Rhae on Zenithon. It's only been a day since he visited.
"Now we've just covered three pillars of my nine pillar system. The first were about your mentality. The next three are about defense, then the last are about offense."
{ Mars - 4 }
"Good."
Yup.
Mars nods.
"You ready to write some shit down?"
"Now there are nine pillars I'm teaching you in total. We've just covered three about your mentality. The next three are about defense, then offense."
Edited previous message: "I'm sure they cover most of that in your training at Monad, but the next time we meet up, We'll go over my way. Which is way better."
"I'm sure they cover most of that at Monad, but the next time we meet up, We'll go over my way. Which is way better."
"All that said, it is pretty important to know how to move. And I mean that in the most rudimentary sense. Like how to bob and weave, how to throw a good punch, or a good kick, or how to attack with a knife, so you're not just whipping your arms around like an idiot when you're supposed to be hitting someone."
"Most people will try and teach you by showing you all the moves from their super secret karate style, that nobody's ever mastered ever, but that's bullshit. Most fights are won by mindset alone. And teaching any complicated moves beyond the most basic ones is irrelevant. You're not trying to prove anything to anyone; you're surviving."
"Yeah! Exactly."
Uh, Being opportunistic, fighting dirty, and moderate aggression?
Mars taps his pen on his hand as he speaks.
"Okay what are the key points I've brought up so far?"
"Because that's fucking stupid. That's why."
Edited previous message: "If you've gotta kill someone, you kill them before they get a chance to see you coming. You never, ever walk out in front of them, or tell them beforehand. You wanna know why?"
Why?
Mars' pen scratches across the notebook. Sirie takes a moment to listen to it.
"If you've gotta kill someone, you kill them before they get a chance to see you coming. You never, ever walk out in front of them, or tell them before hand. You wanna know why?"
"Now, and this is really important. You have to understand that as far as your mindset goes, you can't be the aggressor, trying to kill whoever you're fighting. Over aggression is just as bad as under aggression, because then you're the one making mistakes."
"Even if they're not. Even if it's just some training bullshit for your job. You have go into every fight like your opponent is trying to kill you, and you have to act accordingly."
"It's about killing the person who's trying to kill you."
"Fighting isn't about any honorable bullshit. It's not about proving your worth."
"Don't get me wrong."
What the fuck.
"As long as you know how to capitalize on any and all opportunities, If you're the first person to throw dirt the other person's eyes, or hit them with a rock on the ground, or a piece of junk or something, or if you suckerpunch them before the fight even starts. You'll win no matter what."
Mars is a little speechless.
"Yep. Whichever fighter is dirtier will invariably win."
Edited previous message: "Of course not. It'll usually come down to whichever person is more opportunistic, and has fewer inhibitions."
Uh.
Of course not. It'll usually come down to whichever person is more opportunistic, and has less inhibitions.
Then what? Don't say some bullshit like determination.
"Hah. No."
I don't know... Skill?
"Alright look. What do you think is the deciding factor in most fights?"
"No!" Sirie says, dead serious. "No no no no no. Never."
This sounds a bit like you're fucking with me.
Mars frowns.
"Because you're never gonna have to take notes about anything involving any sort of combat again."
Why?

"Pen?"

"You've got a notebook?"
Okay shoot.
He sits on his bed.
Mars grabs his notebook and a pen.
"I'll show you how easy it is."
"Here, get ready to take some notes."
"What?" Sirie laughs. "Yeah it is."
Fighting isn't like a thing you can learn on the phone.
I mean.
I still don't know why we're doing this on the phone.
"Awesome!"
Yeah, more or less.

Maybe in an hour? Or an hour and a half?

"I wanted to call and start right away!"
"NO! No I'm excited actually."

"I still can't believe you're doing this." Sasha says. "Like, don't get me wrong I'd love to kick Neon's ass too, but don't you think this is exactly what she wants?"

Aradia nods eagerly.
"For now I just want you to pay attention to him, especially for any erratic changes in his mental state and tell me about whatever you find: what, when, why, as much as you can."
"Therapy, especially when oxium is involved, is very sensitive work."
"Well..."
"Right."

Aradia shrugs.
"So which is it?"
"That said if you care about him, and are asking to help because you genuinely want to help, then I'm not here to stop you."
"You might end up hearing or hearing some things that you really don't need to."
"What I'm trying to say, is that if you want to do this out of some particular uh, interest, or anything, you should probably reconsider."
Aradia frowns.
"And none of them are very nice..."
"And that's only important because there are details in here that will probably come up eventually."
"Well... As it stands, I can't give you access to these files unless Mars gives me his permission."

Neon helps Kate to her feet.
Kate pushes as Neon pulls.
She slowly lifts Kate up.
Neon frowns.
Kate stays on the floor.
Neon gets off Kate.
&gt;Alright.&lt;
She breathes.
She can feel a splash of one of her clone's blood on her stomach.
All the tension leaves Kate, she lies limp on the floor.
She tries to wipe them away, but she can't move her arm to do so.
Tears form in Kate's eyes.
&gt;You skipped breakfast today. I know.&lt;
&gt;I'm gonna take you to get your shoulder fixed up. And I'll get you something to eat while you're there.&lt;
&gt;When I let you up, you don't get to try to kill me.&lt;

Neon shifts a little of her weight off Kate.

She takes another breath.

Neon rushes toward the group of three.
Kate 2 makes two more clones.

Neon hits Kate in the chest with her shoulder.
She glances at Neon, who's already crossed the room.
She loses her grip on her left sword as her hand flies instinctively to her throat.
Kate throws herself to the side, too little, too late. The knife embeds itself in her right clavicle, slicing across the bottom of her jugular vein.
What?
Kate begins to focus. Her mind zeroes in on the details of Neon, the knife that's flying toward her throat.

3, The countdown began.
She was ready.
Kate was ready to feel that again.
It was the best thing she'd felt in a while.
How Neon had toed up to Kate's bed, run her hands through her hair and across her cheek, leaned in just close enough that Kate could hit her.
She remembers how she caught her two nights ago, slipping into her room.
Kate glares at Neon.
Neon's had that light in her eyes, that sick playful expression that just pisses Kate off more.
That night when that repulsive bitch violated her.
Kate meets Neon's eyes. She can see that new light in them that Neon gets when their eyes meet. Ever since that incedent.

It's hard to say who has the advantage between the two of them, Kate with her oxium weapons, or Neon. Kate has no way of knowing what's inside that jacket of hers. The faded black army coat that's brimming with pockets. Neon doesn't use it that often, only when she's looking to show off.

Most practice fights use simulation weapons, and they ended at first contact, but She and Neon are going to the death.
Tobin shoots Kate a sympathetic frown, while the other pirates watch her, impassively.
Kate steps into the training room.
The screen shows a white room, with a grid on the floor. Neon's waiting alone inside, sitting on a stool. There's a static holographic image in the center of the room, it's just the number 3, poised to count down.
They're waiting by the screens that Tobin had set up yesterday with a video stream of the inside of one of the Sim chambers.
Inside, there's a small crowd of pirates as well as a few horrorsquad members who have come to watch.
She opens it.
She walks to the door to the training hall.
Kate listens in silence as they continue to argue.
"You just be quiet and good and watch. Trust our friend to handle herself." Boenn says plainly.
"So, what better avenue does Kate have to attack her enemy? Their strengths and weaknesses are similar. Kate understands this. So they will put them to the test."
Sasha doesn't respond.
Boenn scoffs. "Look at where we live! You're more delusional than even I thought, Alexander. On The Marche Slave we are valued for our strengths, be they of body, will, mind, or skill. They are all we have."
"Yeah, well most people don't settle their differences by killing each other."
"Tochinova," Boenn growls, "Do not challenge her decision. Personally, I believe this outcome was inevitable. Kate and The Neon Creature have been at odds for as long as they've been here."
"I still can't believe you're do this." Sasha says. "Like, don't get me wrong I'd love to kick Neon's ass too, but don't you think this is exactly what she wants?"

He takes a few sips and sets it on the table.

Half of the airport is burning or destroyed in some way or another.
They're on top of the main terminal of the airport.
He looks out at the view.
Instead the Tzezeren lies back in his chair.
He doesn't get a response, not that he was expecting one.
He stands up, spreads his arms, and grins at Ethy.
Finally, he places a beach umbrella in a stand behind the table, between the two chairs.
There are two different six packs of beers in the cooler, one for The Ethyrian and one for himself.
The Tzezeren unfolds the recliners he packed. He also sets up a small folding table. Beneath him, he sets down an ice filled cooler.

Lady Wolf takes some time to respond.
Y9u- What? What do you mean?
"You sound so guarded. There's no need to worry, I'm not some sort of debt collector. Nor do I believe in any sort of 'sins of the father, sins of the daughter' modus. No. Rather, this is about his legacy, and ensuring everything he put into place comes into fruition."
Veruvi frowns, "Thanks."
"Yes... I heard he isn't with us anymore. My condolences."
...9h.
"Anyway dear, I'm calling now because of a bit of unfinished business that concerns your father."
Veruvi doesn't say anything.
"My, so you remember me as well. I'm glad! I try to keep my voice distinct, you know how easy it is to confuse people's voices on the phone."

"Excellent!" Veruvi tries to remember. "I wasn't sure which number was your number, It's been quite a while since we last talked. But I found it on my first try, how exciting!" The name hits her.
"Yes... That's me." Veruvi responds.
"Excuse me, is this miss Veruvi Salisk?" A feminine voice drawls, it's vaguely familiar, she's heard it once or twice before...

Veruvi picks it up.
Not from Mars, he only has a work phone these days.

She pulls it out.
Her phone begins to buzz in her pocket.
She watches the ship take off.

Veruvi raises her hand as well.
He raises a hand goodbye as the doors close.
He's the last to get on.
Mars smiles, and starts walking backward toward the ferry.
Veruvi nods.
Yeah. It'll go by like nothing.

Neither of them say anything.
He hugs back.
He steps closer, she hugs him.

It's a closeup of Red, just her head and the upper half of her torso.
Neon turns the canvas over, so it's facing her.
She has to keep those memories afloat, it would kill her if they disappeared again.
But with her oxium came a flood of memories.
The red paintings used to be practice for transformations.
That name used to mean something different.
She pulls out the one in the back, this one is the most recent of her Red Collection.
The paintings are behind the coat hanger she uses for her jacket. They're hidden by a small dresser with some of her other clothes.
Neon pulls one of the screens out of the way and steps inside.
She keeps her best paintings behind there too.
Her favorite knives, her jacket, her stolen books.
She keeps the things she doesn't want people to touch behind it.
Neon heads to the folding screen.
Her room on the horror squad deck was too tight, suffocating, surrounded by eyes and voices and lies and laughter. She couldn't sleep there. So she sleeps here.
Too bad he never comes into this room.
Boenn would be jealous of a bed like hers.
It truly is a wonderful bed.
In the right she has her ever-expanding bed of pillows.
In the left corner she has a folding screen that Tobin gave her, to hide all her most personal things behind.
She navigates her way through the circles and heads to the back wall of her room.
Neon checks the door for a moment, then pushes herself to her feet.
Those aren't paintings for others to look at.
Not "even," actually. Not using them was very deliberate.
There are even a few pieces that she didn't use in the circle set-up.
She's been spending a lot of time in her room since her outing with Tobin. She's already amassed a collection big enough to start selling.
The unfinished ones are closest, in her immediate view. Then behind and in between those, the finished, discernable paintings, where the subject is clear and detailed, and behind those she has her abstracts. Splatters and splashes of formless color to fill in the gaps. From the center of the room, it looked like one singular work of art.
Edited previous message: She's arranged her paintings in a series of circles around her.

Edited previous message: Sirie puts an arm around Veruvi's shoulders. She pulls the girl close.
That's what Sirie believes.
Now that the Salisk conflict is resolved, things can only get better for the four of them. For the five of them.
It's been a while since she's had a day that was so close to perfect.
Sirie chuckles.
Aw shit...
I'm g9nna abuse the hell 9ut 9f this fr9m n9w 9n. You're g9nna wish y9u never sh9wed 9ff.
Veruvi looks Mars in the eyes.
"The walnuts are good. That's something I wouldn't have thought of until the next day." Sirie muses.
Sirie continues to nod.
Edited previous message: "Well, Sirie," Faye says, "color me impressed."
"Well, Sirie, color me impressed."
Sirie nods. The ladies have been appeased.
He stirs the dressing with a fork.
Then he crushes a clove of garlic into it as well.
He pulls oregano out of the spice cabinet and adds a dash of that to the dressing.
Mars narrows his eyes.
Sirie, Veruvi, and Faye stare him down.
He grates some of the lemon zest across the top of the salad. Then he adds some crushed walnuts.
He slowly pulls a grater from the drawer.
Nobody answers.
Christ fuck can you tone down the pressure?
He looks up for a moment at the three watching him.
They watch Mars whip together a simple dressing of olive oil, vinegar, and lemon.
Instead Sirie goes and stands at the counter next to Veruvi.
She could mix cocktails, but Veruvi doesn't know that she knows how to do that.
She's never had someone help her cook before. She doesn't quite know what to do at the moment. Everything she had laid out for herself earlier is being taken care of.
Sirie tucks her hair behind her left ear.
She takes a quick breather, watching Mars slice cherry tomatoes for the salad, which he had taken the responsibility of throwing together.
Faye places the lid on the pot, turns the heat down to a simmer and leans against the countertop next to the stove.
Sirie watches out of the corner of her eye as the two of them whisper back and forth, Faye's impish grin spreading ever wider.
Eventually Veruvi and Faye settle down and watch over the counter.
They don't talk much as they prepare dinner. Every once in a while, Sirie will give an order; Mars will drop what he's doing and follows her instructions.
Mars digs through the fridge and gets to work.
"Alright first I'm gonna need some minced carrots and celery. They're in the fridge. The good knives are in the rack." Sirie points. "Chop chop."
Mars high fives Faye and rushes into the kitchen.
"Fine." She shrugs, "I hope you've been practicing."
Sirie narrows her eyes first at Faye, then at Mars.
"Only if you let Mr. Bigshot Tough-as-fuck Chef help you cook." Faye rubs her feet on the coffee table.
"Faye get your feet off my fuckin' table!" Sirie shouts, grinning.
Mars hops up from his spot on the couch next to Veruvi. Faye has her feet kicked up on the coffee table, sitting across from Veruvi in the single chair on the right. Sirie's spot on her ottoman is left unmolested.
Sirie looks over at the three of them.
"No, don't worry about us," Faye says, "Go! Show her what you've got, little guy."
Mars says something beneath the laughter.
Sirie listens to Veruvi laugh as she chops an onion.

"That is all." Vox says.
"My wife continues to handle the business side of all our operations." Vox shrugs. "And I stand by her decisions, whether or not I personally agree with them."
Lady Wolf speaks up, "It's incredibly expensive and time consuming technology to make. Not quite worth the effort, if we were to just give them away without compensation." She tilts her head to the side. "We'll be open to all sorts of deals, from money, to equipment, to favors. If anyone's interested feel free to give me a call."
He lays his hands, open-faced on the table.
"I've been appropriating Ahmkara technology in my and my wife's territories. We've been designing automated oxium mining constructs. A test run has shown they're able to completely mine out mid to large planet within two months. I'd love to begin mass production and donate these to our cause, but..."
He looks around.
Vox comes last.
I had enemies up until a week ago. I crushed them in preparation for this meeting. Nothing to report.
He breathes heavily.
Karex sits straight in his chair.
His ship, Ozotha's Husk is long and flat planed, Triangular from the front and back.

Next comes Kell Karex Oehl. He's a High Noloth Vessel from a tall cylindrical helmet that hides all of his face except his four eyes, arranged in a diamond in the center of his head. His upper body is bare and strained with cord-like bulges that shift drastically as he moves.
She crosses her arms and legs.
"That's it."
"My territory is going through an influx of self-righteous idiot bounty hunters. I've been having a real ball killing them all."
Sen's lip curls as she talks.
Sen of Akashia is from Ikorah, she has two beady yellow eyes in each socket, dark grey skin and a mouth with four prominent fangs. Her ears are large and pointed and she is the captain of the ship named Akashia Rez Prava.

His ship is The Hebridean Imprint.
Iudex is a pithyte of unimpressive height, his arms are thin, and his face is gaunt, grey, and covered in cracks and scars. His eyes are a dull green. He holds himself stiff and tall, and gives off an air of control that's much more impressive than Maw can muster even when standing straight.
"Thank you, Ludovica, that was all."
Edited previous message: "I've actually had the pleasure of dealing with your Veruvi not too long ago, Praxis. If you want to work something out, I'd gladly find her for you."

"Well. Aside from Salisk being dead... The ship we have been building is nearly complete. All it needs is the installation of it's defense systems and the... uh... Key... To turn it on. Which is with Salisk's daughter. Whom we have no way of contacting."
He doesn't have a ship. He came in on a ferry from Ipo.
He's human looking, being from Ipo Rakaikon, he's wearing a long red and black robe with a matching hat. His hat is tall and straight. He's not skinny. or weak looking. He'd actually be kind of handsome if he weren't shaking like a rabbit surrounded by mountain lions.
"Praxis, ma'am." Praxis' voice wavers.
Edited previous message: He's a Tersicore Man o' War, the only one that isn't privately owned, and possibly the sole reason the project was cancelled. He's nearly 8 feet tall and bulging with muscular structures that were designed to perfection. He wears an Amphiron style dress suit, tailored to fit him. His eyes are dull grey, with no irises. His ship is called the Spindle Demon.
"Actually, I'm only 12. I feel like that's as good an age to be edgy as ever."
"Beaumare, or over to Tersicore. You don't think I'm gonna give up my territory over a bunch of inbred cucks in power armor, do you?"
"Can I please fuck off now, my Queen?"
"Sorry, sorry."
"Can I fuck off now?"
"If you ever want to fuck up a big, Monad affiliated organization, New Avalon's wide open."
"Yeah."
"So as far as Roen-heib goes, your agent can do whatever the fuck he wants. I'm gonna move out within the month."
"But, heh, I'd already decimated that girl. Haha, She's completely mine now. I had her steal some prototype weapons and information from their base for me, and in the process I got them pissed. Which is why I was late."
He starts to chuckle.
"Then, just a couple days ago, after I finished with her, I let the New Avalon fuckers sneak into my Roen-Heib base and 'free' that knight I captured."

The Maw's mandibles click decisively.
"It does get quite boring there though. If you find anyone interesting and looking for information, I'd love it if you all could refer them to me."
She rests one elbow on the table and flicks her wrist to the side as she speaks. "I have nothing to report, as usual. The Awakazi empire remains wholly under my control."
Lady Wolf wears a mask like Vox's with six eye slots instead of his four. She wears a long, white, fur coat with black buttons and lining. The collar is a massive wash of speckled grey fur.

"That was a joke, right?"
The Maw looks at Vica, his mandibles hang slack from his face.
Praxis bows his head.
"Yes, ah, we'll take care of everything right away my Queen."
His name is Baron Praxis and he was not prepared for this shit.
The man is sweating profusely.
"And we're, um, having trouble getting a hold of his successor."

Tobin is engrossed in her phone.

Red watches the waves roll onto the sand.
It's incredibly terrifying, being helpless.
Red looks out across the beach.
It's incredibly terrifying.
There's pain and stress and fear, but its distant. It's not hers, but it is.
She wonders if this was what the normal everyday citizens felt like, way back when.
It's a different experience, She thinks, Viewing these events from the outside, being so desperately attached to the outcomes of something she has no part in whatsoever.
She hadn't heard anything about the planet since then.
His sister had just had him exiled from his own country. He had told Red he was going to kill her before he left.
Red frowns.
Of course, the kid didn't understand why, but he had cried as well.
She had cried when Oryx's son Yor told her the news on Euxia.
Red tried not to think of that stuff. It tended to make her cry.
His daughter took his place in every aspect. She assumed Queenship over her planet. She took her stepmother as a lover, and then she was named the third Lord Wolf.
Oryx had died five years after, killed by an Ahmkara he had been hunting.
It had been over fifty years since she last set foot on Yon Oryx.
That's what she tells herself.
She only made it like that because Oryx's was the best castle she'd ever seen.
Red didn't miss her friend. She'd gotten over it.
It wasn't anything special, but she didn't miss how much it resembled Oryx's citadel.
She's on one of Beaumare's plentiful secluded beaches. A couple children play in the waves. She just helped them build a sandcastle.
She's lying in the shade of a palm tree, wearing a skirt laced with palm fronds and a loose peach camisole.

Neon bends down and licks up the side of Kate's throat.
Neon drops Kate onto her bed.
Neon grins in the dim light.
She lets out a quiet moan of pain.
Kate's body tenses up.
Kate is wrapped into another hug, she feels another kiss, this one above her eye, then below, then on her nose, then on her lips. then her jaw, her neck her collar, her shoulder, her chest, down to the tip of her left breast where Neon bites, hard.
&gt;A-alright, then... One more time, like friends, right?&lt;
Neon inches closer.
Kate feels her mouth say something that's blocked to her again.
&gt;I don't know what came over me there.&lt;
She says this aloud.
&gt;I'm uh, sorry.&lt;
Neon pulls away.
She feels a soft, cool kiss on her cheek.
She hears something hard clatter to the floor as Neon pulls her into a tight hug.
Her mouth moves and air rushes through her throat, but Kate can't hear the words her body is saying.
Kate feels her body nod again, a small smile plastered onto her lips.
&gt; You'll really let me paint you? You're sure. &lt;

Kate feels her head shake no. A shudder goes down her spine.
&gt; Kate you're very beautiful. Did you know that? &lt;
Neon smiles, but it's a wary one, like she's unsure of herself for some reason.
Kate feels her head nod as she thinks, "Hell the fuck no."
 &gt; We're friends Kate, aren't we? &lt;
Neon doesn't respond for a while. Her right hand absentmindedly strokes Kate's hair.
"What do you want?" Kate thinks.
Neon's mouth doesn't move with the voice in Kate's head. It's disconcerting.
&gt; Good. Very good. It's just us. Relax. &lt;
Or at least she thinks that's what she's doing.

All Kate can think is, What the fuck.
Neon whispers, "You're awake. Hello."
She looks straight into Neon's bright green eyes.
Her head turns to the left on its own.
She hears a sharp intake of breath from next to her. The dimmer light on her nightstand turns on, then down very low.
Kate tries to scream, but the air won't move from her lungs and her mouth won't open.

{ The Reindeer Effigy - Summer }
The skull looks at me.
Nothing at all.
Nothing.
I wave my hand in front of the fire.
I look at the wall.
My shadow in comparison.
The mark it leaves on the wall and the world.
I think I notice for the first time again the majesty of this beast.
It fills me with emotions I can't describe.
I look into the skulls eyes. It holds me for a reason I don't understand.
Its antlers arc and flare out back and away from the skull and cast sharp shadows on the wall behind it.
Behind the book, sitting on a pedestal, is the entire, unmolested skull of a reindeer.
There is a table in the center, with a large journal sitting open on display.
Unlike mosst of the library, this room is mostly bare. There are very few books on the shelves.
I look around.
The room is filled with the warm glow of fire.
I light the lamps by the door.
I pull the door open and head inside.
I unlock the door.
He tells me the way, and I follow his instructions. Up the staircase, two floors, then to the left, two doors down.
It is an old key, it looks worn. But most of the library's keys are old and worn. This one doesn't stand out.
Slowly he pulls it out.
He grins and rustles through his pockets for the key.
I nod. "Yes... I think I would like to see this room."
"The library has a room solely dedicated to the recordings of previous caretakers! I'm surprised you never asked about them before."
The Librarian smiles. "Of course! You didn't think you were the first caretaker, did you?"
"People studied the reindeer?"
Edited previous message: "If you'd like I could show you some of the older studies on the reindeer." He smiles.
"If you'd like I could show you some of the older studies on the reindeer."

"As far as this library knows, the town has never had shadows. That is simply the way it has always been."
"I know of every book in this library. There are none that answer your questions, friend."
The Librarian thinks for a moment. He frowns.
"I'd like to know about the shadows, why nobody has them, why they're cut from newcomers."
"Are you looking for something in particular? Or would you like a suggestion?" He asks.
"Hello." I nod.
"Hello, Caretaker," he says, "It is a pleasurable surprise to see you tonight."
The Librarian comes to greet me.
The doors close behind me, and I take a lantern.
The library doors are old carved wood. Made from the trees of the forest.
It had rained earlier today. It looks like it will rain again.
I make my way there, the sky is dark with clouds.
I tell him the library and he lets me go.
The Gatekeeper lets me in. He sounds amused when he asks where I'll be going.
I stand still for a moment, then turn to return to the town.
He is looking away, deeper into the woods, to places where no men travel.
I see him standing in the clearing as I approach.
The sun is falling, I leave town and walk with the reindeer back into the forest once more.
Autumn is coming approaching. The Reindeer King is patient, but not very.
These days blend into one another. Slowly they grow shorter, and the nights grow longer, and the days grow colder, and the reindeer grow louder.
There are no windows in the cabin, so I can't see their stares, but I can imagine them well.
At night, I lie awake and listen as the reindeer walk circles around my cabin.
The Librarian believes that shadows are housed in a vault beneath the town. The Doctor does not like thinking of the shadows; she wants nothing to do with them.
I spent a few days speaking to the Doctor and to the Librarian.
I need the keys If I am to release my shadow.
The Gatekeeper keeps his keys hung up by the front door.
I spend most of my days with the Gatekeeper and the Builder, in the gatehouse.

Mav's shoulders droop. She is instantly depressed.
"Goregok mind if I go get more of the shrimp skewers? I'll be right back."
"Nice dude."
Mav nods again.
"Cause it was fucked up and gross."
"Cool."
Mav nods.

Mav nods. "Were you and the other guy friends?
"What's it like running the board solo?"
"That's pretty cool."
Mav nods.
Veruvi shrugs
Can't argue with that...
She's not wr9ng th9ugh, like I had t9 6uy new mattresses every c9uple days after I first g9t my p9wers.
I'm sure it'll 6e s9mething c99l, Pringle.
Sirie grins.
"I'm very glad I did." Yvelte smiles politely.
"Veruvi emailed me a picture of my invitation a week ago. I wouldn't have even realized it was happening otherwise."
Glad y9u came Yvelte.
Yvelte smiles. "Thank you. I miss you all too. I've been incredibly busy these days. I wish I could find some time to stop by."
"Yourself?"
"Hello," Yvelte smiles. "I am well."
She takes a seat next to Veruvi.
Then a moment later comes Yvelte.
Veruvi and Sirie make their ways over.
"Holy shit."
"They'll be fine," she smiles at the freaky alien thing.
She looks down at the water.
Liz walks up to Hydrin.
Liz takes a few photos.

Qitara smiles at Kisket, and it takes a second before Kisket smiles back.
"How about we get some more fruits?"
"That was a very abrupt change of tone."
Qitara frowns.
Kisket stares at Harrier. Her expression is a mix of abstact horror and regret.
I- fuck I shouldn't have said anything about that...
Sorry.
So...
I heard a little about what happened with your team.
Well.
Really?
She's totally shameless.
Kisket rolls her eyes again.
"Very cute! We are a cute couple, aren't we. Sometimes I think we're too cute for words!"
"I spent mine learning how to kill."
Edited previous message: "She spent her life learning how to heal people."
"She spent her life learning how to heal people.
"It's kind of funny."
That was time well spent.
I helped heal people who were seriously injured in arena fights for several years.
I enjoyed it when it wasn't so meaningless.
Kisket shrugs.
It wasn't very fun.
Spent most of my days cutting small things open and looking inside.
I was a Biology major.
I wouldn't know.
"You don't have to explain... It's making Kis uncomfortable."
"I just wanted to ask how it was done."
Kisket rests her head on the table, and Qitara rubs her back.
Kisket's hand falls away from Qitara.
Oh god.
Kisket's face is red as hell.
Kisket's hand covers Qitara's mouth.
"Kisket has asked me several times about try-"
"So you've done the ropes and binding things?"
That's true enough.
Kisket nods a little.
You don't stike me as the kind of guy...
Kisket's eyes narrow a fraction.
You-you've tried anal beads?
No not at all.
Well you're more prepared for one than the other.
Kisket frowns.
Yeah. It sounds pretty terrible.
Kisket opens, then closes her mouth.
Sounds painful.
Shitting pits.
"They are amazing."
"A little, yes."
Qitara shrugs, "They're the seedless ones from the cocktail bar."
Qitara laughs a little as she swallows the olive.
Kisket giggles.
Kisket forgoes the tooth pick this last time, and Qitara's teeth brush up aginst her fingers.
They're running low on olives though, and Kisket is feeling majorly unhappy with this fact.
Both of them lost their shoes somewhere under the table, and Kisket keeps brushing her feet up against Qitara's. She loves watching the little color shifts on Qitara's face when she's not expecting a touch.
Kisket and Qitara have been feeding each other vodka soaked olives for the past 10 minutes.

"It's really cute to watch."
"You're good for him."
Porcea's got a big grin on her face as she watches this exchange with her hands on her hips.
"eek! I love it when he does that!"
"I still haven't gotten to ask you what you've been up to Deafio!"
Porcea looks down at Deafio.
Porcea smiles wide.

She shakes her head.
Porcea's smile falls a little.
"You gotta nail her between the eyes for me."
"Fuck her!"
"The 'hey baby' bitch?!"
"How effective the shot was."
"That stuff matters,"
"Yeah definitely."
"No way?"
Porcea nods.
"Fuck it... It was totally a shithole."
Porcea makes faces as she thinks for something more appropriate for Deafio.
"Or wait that came out wrong."
"It felt like one too."
"Yeah!"
"Yep. It was pretty crazy."
"I didn't see you on the Prodigia mission, but I heard you were there."
Porcea grins.
"Raros!"
He dips back out.
aight.
Tracy nods as he rubs his shoulder a bit.
congrats again, you guys are great.
Tracy smiles.
i gotta go make sure my cousin doesn't kill herself on accident or something.
Tracy nods.
anyway i just wanted to say wassup cause i saw ya auto. i'll let you get back to it.
Tracy takes a sip of the rum and coke he brought.
Tracy laughs a bit.

i mean like
Tracy looks terrified.
congratulations man.
Tracy is sort of dying.
hey auto!
Tracy is back.
yep
Tracy leaves.

Tracy claps Raros on the back.
Tracy looks around as well.
honestly i didn't look at her.
the ending it all tonight is a super viable option club.
welcome to the club.
holy shit.
you asked her out right?
yes we've seen elesa.
He stuffs his hands in his coat pockets and follows everyone with his head down.
Tracy shakes his head.
i don't know what i did to deserve that.
my life is over.
Tracy looks up at Raros.
...
Liz heads inside with Veruvi and Sirie.
Liz looks at Veruvi and Sirie.
Liz looks at Tracy and Raros.
Kisket and Qitara head back inside.
Kisket shrugs.
"Looks like Shanta broke him."
Tracy nods.
Tracy?
Kisket smiles.
Alright.
Don't stay out here too long, okay?
Qitara has to forcibly turn Kisket's head back toward her a couple times.
Kisket and Qitara step out behind Elesa.
Tracy nods wordlessly.
She hides her phone as she takes a picture of Shanta.
Liz hops over.
Tracy is at a loss for words.
oh my god that guy!
holy fuck!
Veruvi and Sirie look over from their conversation in the ship.
Tracy does the same.
Tracy lets out a strangled breath.
Tracy is holding back his laughter for dear life.
Tracy snorts.
Cypress leaves the ship with the ball under one arm. Voracious is complaining about something or other.
He's got a glass ball to contain voracious, who's wearing a bowtie.
Cypress stands up.
i'll guard you.
Tracy gets back on the ship.
Liz is still texting in the ship.
Tracy hops out.
lets get out there.
deal.
fine
sure
alright... a hundred credits, if more than half the people here like how you look i win, if they think you look stupid than you win.
wanna make another bet?
fine
but if you had the choice you wouldn't have worn that either, right?
you look sharp as fuck.
you don't understand fashion, man
Tracy grins as he watches Raros in the suit.
Lets go get changed.
Kisket sticks out her tongue.
"You know I'm more athletic than you in pretty much every way." Qitara smiles as she takes the hand.
Kisket hops down and offers her hand to help Qitara.
Kisket gets up as well, As does Qitara.
Most likely.
Kisket grabs the armrests of her seat.
Christ!

She grins and follows her cousin.
Liz waves at Shanta.
Tracy leaves the hallway.
bye.
He smiles a bit.
nah.
Tracy rubs his left eye.
no.
no!
alright.
Tracy sort of shrugs from down the hallway.
have a good rest of your day... i hope i didn't fuck it up too much or anything.
right...
He walks away.
Tracy steps back.
see you later.
thanks.
cool.
uh.
okay
i'm fuckin rambling.
and she's got good taste and all.

Tracy holds them out.

i got them for you.
no no.

obligation that i'm asking you at this point.
it's almost out of like.
He scratches the back of his head.
honestly i expected that.
alright.
Tracy lets out a breath.
Tracy doesn't say anything.
as my date?
will you go to the wedding with me?
Tracy pulls out the flowers.
...
hey shanta.
Liz chuckles as she watches him from down the hallway.
He's hiding them behind his back.
He's got a bouquet of flowers in hand.
Tracy knocks on Shanta's door.

Tobin nods.
"Maybe some sort of power will give me a better role than just... the team programmer."
"But like put me up against Boenn, and there's no reason for me."

Edited previous message: The Ophidiate sets to drilling.
The Ophidian sets to drilling.
Probably a mix of both.
Or maybe it's the feeling of hand crafting some poor bastards inevitable gruesome death.
Like what becoming a Chromatin did for her.
Maybe its the feeling of turning something normal into something extraordinary.
There's something about boring holes into stock bullets with a hand drill that never fails to give her peace of mind.
Now that she's here, she's actually kind of glad.
Last time she left, she didn't have time to finish making her bullets.
She goes into her room and plops down onto her workdesk.
The Ophidiate sighs.
But he'd been transferred to the Justiczar, and now there's no way he's going anywhere else...
And then that oxium. So much unrealized potential! So much potential synergy.
Connections where you don't have to talk are the best connections of them all.
Which Zacht would get on her ass about eventually, but he doesn't understand at all.
Even though she had only said four words to him.
She felt like they had really made a connection over that last mission.
She had asked for that glass kid to be put under her command.
The Ophidiate walks out of her debriefing with the Justiczar feeling incredibly dissatisfied.

&gt;Of course, I wasn't expecting much, since I couldn't even see his face, but something about his helmet.&lt;
&gt;I couldn't get through the Vox Mortis guy's helmet.&lt;
&gt;And then.&lt;

&gt;Yes.&lt;

Vox and his party enter their limousine back at the entrance of the restaurant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Well, with all of that out of the way," Vox says, "Would you do me the honor of telling me how you managed to kill Razrez and take his ship?"
Acropos doesn't order either, but for more obvious reasons, like the lack of a mouth.
Etainien orders a salad and soup.
Vox orders two of the steaks, one for himself and one for later.
Neon orders a salad and a fish plate.
"It's... A spiritual experience."
"I'd recommend the Marichore Steak."
Vox picks up his menu for the first time.
He asks to take their orders.
The waiter chooses this time to come back with the drinks.
"I will."
"Alright." Vox nods.
"You're right, we're not equals. I apologize for making that assumption."
"Alright captain."
Vox laughs.
Vox's mask remains impassive.
"So what do you say?"
"...At best. At worst it might be interesting enough to investigate."
"For me to go so far out of my way for something so small would look odd."
"My fleet is known for trafficing the area between kordova and Beaumare."
"Marche slave."
"Right."
"You're the captain of the Horrorshow. No matter what you do, you'll already have the eyes of everyone in the galaxy on you. A string of theft won't be a big deal in comparison to the types of debauchery you and your crew usually get into."
"Hopefully to avoid drawing the wrong type of attention."
"You don't need to go out of your way to find them though. Feel free to take as long as you need."
"We'll give you half of the Oxium up front, and a portion of the remainder for each of these orbs you aquire for us."
"I know the locations of six currently."

She fidgets with the fork in her hands.
Neon picks up one of her forks.
Vox looks back and forth between Neon and Susett.

"How about we start with some Introductions?"
"So."
Neon turns to look at him.
Vox leans forward onto the table.
The yak'cho narrows it's eyes.

Neon looks at the furry fuck.
He's sitting next to Neon.
Neon to Vica's left, Susett to her right, next to Susett, the bird alien, next to her, Vox, next to him, the robot, and next to the robot, a short yak'cho with a hole in its ear hops into the seat.
They all sit down at the table.
Then a waiter takes them into the building, behind a screen, up a stairwell and onto a private balcony.
Vox leads them in.
Neon stands up.
Vox gestures toward the entrance.
"Why don't we head inside."
"Something came up."
He nods.
Vox nods. "Ludovica."
The limo pulls off.
Out of the right, a short alien with feathers that reach down and fall around her waist, and a large bipedal robot.
Out of the left side of the car, steps Vox mortis.
The driver, a skittish looking, kordovian man hops out and opens up the back doors.
A limousine pulls up.
Neon groans somewhere out of the back of her throat.
Neon watches the people as they talk to each other, her left hand begins to pantomime the people's motions.
There are only four or five other people outside.
&gt;There are way too many people.&lt;
&gt;I really don't like waiting here.&lt;
A dab of blue paint that was still on her right middle finger begins to stain the fabric of her dress.
Her fingers start drumming on her legs.
Neon realizes she's getting incredibly jealous.
She watches the back massage intently.
Neon stops making faces.
Neon starts making more even more aggressively over-the top faces.
Then another one.
Neon makes a face.
She looks over at Vica.
Neon is very bored.
They've sitting outside of the front of this fancy fucking restaurant for fifteen minutes.
Neon picks at the lacy patterns on the dress Tobin bought for her.

She sits at her desk and turns the chair around.
Aradia invites him in.

Aradia smiles.
Edited previous message: 0h, hi!
0h, hi! Aradia smiles.
She's got a headphone in her left ear.
Aradia opens the door.
Cya later.
Oh.
Maybe Aradia!
If you want a relationship then go for a relationship.
But I don't know.
You shouldn't be discounting that option.
I mean.
That's a while.
Mars nods.
Fair.
...
Well then I'll vent at you and you'll get to feel better knowing that you aren't alone!
Bro time.
It'll be.
You can vent some more.
Mars nods.
Yeah you do.
Edited previous message: Cause maybe there was another incident.
Cause maybe there was another incedent.
I was just making sure.
What Anunda thing?
He drops a backpack on the floor by the door.
Mars steps inside.
Sup.
Edited previous message: It's Mars.
Surprise.
It's Mars
There is a knock at the door.
He just watches.
The Tzezeren lands next to the Ethyrian.
The Tzezeren starts heading for the Ethyrian.
He fires a bullet surrounded in entropic energy at the plane's turbine.
The Tzezeren is done charging.
It begins to vibrate.
The Tzezeren's gun is glowing like crazy, now.
"I know." The Tzezeren says. "I'll handle that. Just make sure none of them shoot me."
The rifle begins to glow white.
"Would you mind buying time?"
He charges his rifle.
The Tzezeren aims for the turbine on its left wing.
The Tzezeren pulls the rifle off his back.
The Tzezeren nods to himself.
"Everyone else is too loud."
"I think I miss working with you."
"Why we don't do missions like this anymore?"
The Tzezeren levitates in silence.
The Tzezeren follows her.
The Tzezeren follows her through the glass.
The Tzeren smiles behind his helmet.
The Tzezeren floats over it.
The Tzezeren sighs.
"Kill the manager."
"You didn't have to do that you know."
Edited previous message: The Tzezeren looks at The Ethyrian's copy.
The Tzezeren looks at The Ethyrian's copy
A tiny space inside of the gun pirate's brain expands several yards and snaps back within the space of a second.
He flicks his left wrist to the side.
The Tzezeren begins to raise his hands.
"Woah, watch where you point that thing."
"Just ignore her for a bit, won't you?"
"Sometimes I think she might be deaf as well."
"She can't respond, my friend."
The Tzezeren watches the Ethryian
The Tzezeren goes through the door and floats back into the air.
He bows his head a bit, "We'll notify you when the pirates are taken care of."
"She's a little rude."
"Excuse her."
The Tezeren tilts his head to the side.
"Thank you."
The Tzezeren nods.
"A location would be nice."
Edited previous message: "Then we'll have ourselves a vacation."
"Then we'll have ourselves a vacation.
"We're going to kill them all."
"I see."
"Yes, we are." The Tzezeren says.
He remains standing.
The Tzezeren leans against the door.
He closes the door.
The Tzezeren floats in behind her.
The Tzezeren folds his arms and looks around.
The Tzezeren follows her out, slowly gliding down the distance and stopping a couple inches above the floor.
{ Mars - 2 }
Aradia stands there in the hallway for a second, then heads onward.
Mars heads back to his room.
0kay.
Yeah, for sure.
see you later then?
uh
0h. it is...
Mars points behind him.
My room is over this way.
is it?
This is where we split up.
The walk a little further.
huh.
...n0 kidding...
aradia is quiet for a bit.
Mars nods, a little slower.
like right n0w?
Mars nods.
girlfriend... y0u have a girlfriend?
Um. She's my uh... girlfriend. From back on Earth.
"Veruvi?" Aradia looks at Mars. "Who's that?"
I got to see Veruvi, meet some of the people there.
It was nice.
s0... h0w was visiting uti's sister?
They walk in silence for a little bit.
I guess so.
then i guess i'll have t0 bring a n0tepad.
You'll be wishing you took notes when I'm done.
I'll fucking show you productive. You just fuckin... watch and learn.
i didn't mean t0 let that 0ut.
Aradia scoffs a little, then covers her mouth.
I can be productive.
Edited previous message: what? it's true! d0n't get all upset, there's n0thing wr0ng with it.
what? it's true! d0n't get all upset, there's n0thing wr0ng it.
Mars narrows his eyes once again.
y0u're a big sulking d0wner and y0u d0n't d0 anything pr0ductive ever.
None of Jan's parties start before 8.
i remember back when y0u used t0 make fun 0f me f0r being a "d0wner," n0w l00k at y0u.
Want an example?
0h how the times have changed...
Aradia isn't even listening.
That's just cause everything that's actually fun happens at night.
y0u d0n't even have time in the day t0 be fun.
bullshit, y0u sleep in until n00n 0r 0ne 0n all y0ur 0ff days.
I am not. I'm a very cool and fun individual.
maybe y0u're just a d0wner.
That's only cause you went in there to say hi.
set seemed very nice, and smart.
Aradia smiles.
It was alright.
Aradia stands and puts her phone away.
h0w did it g0?
Aradia's sitting in a chair next to the door, reading a book on her phone.
Mars leaves the room.
Set waves once.
Okay, see you on Friday.
Mars narrows his eyes, but decides not to say anything else.
"Good for you." Set winks.
I- What? No. Aradia's just a friend.
"Now get the fuck out of here. Your girlfriend has had her nose against my door for like the entire half-hour and It's fuckin' creepin' me out."
"Alright."
Alright.
...
Mars doesn't say anything for a bit.
"If you ever need to talk? I- you know where to find me."
"So."
Set sighs. "Whatever. Look, I'm not a therapist or anything; I don't know how that shit works, but part of my job is to be there to help you with anything you need..."
It's not. I would have brought it up if it was.
"It sounded pretty important."
No. Definitely not.
"It doesn't have to do with the stuff you told Geda in the evaluation session, does it?"
Set sighs.
Nothing. I-I'll stick with it.
Mars frowns more.
"Oh? What do I have to do?"
No, you don't have to do that.
No.
"How about this? I'll pay you. A hundred credits for every mission where you actually test out the shit I'm giving you to test."
Set taps her pen a little faster.
Mars frowns.
"Would it kill you to work with me?"
Set twists back and forth in her chair.
"Fucking, take an optimistic viewpoint every once in a while. Think about how awesome all this shit you can do is."
"But like, you don't need to look like you're some kind of prisoner all the damn time."
"Look, I get it, you didn't exactly sign up to be experimented on, have machinery and shit grafted into you, microchip slots implanted into your shoulder where you cant reach cause regulation doesn't allow us to trust our patients."
Mars doesn't say anything.
"What you know? Dude your oxium powers look like they're working against you half the time. How does that qualify as something you 'know?'"
I guess I'm more comfortable sticking to what I know.
I just like...
Set pinches the bridge of her nose.
Mars shrugs.
"Then what's going on?"
No, there's no pain.
"I mean, I can't say I don't expect a little stupid out of you... but one would think there's like a base-line of sense to be had."
"Cause that would be really stupid."
Mars shakes his head.
"You say you're not feeling pain, right? You're not lying, are you?"
"And don't bullshit me, please? I know you haven't I have access to all your helmet feeds. Like, for the past four missions you've used nothing but your oxium."
"So. Say again, why you're not using the psionics?"
Set can see just fine though, She had said as much the last time Mars had asked.
The room is too dark, lit only by Set's computer, her monitors, hard drive and equipment.
She's frowning, glancing up from her notes every couple seconds to glare at Mars in the other chair.
Set keeps tapping her pen on the right arm of her chair as she thinks.
{ Mars - 2 }
{ Qitara - 2 }
Qitara smiles.
Kisket nods a little.
"Yes, I am also thinking of her."
Kisket's hands are reaching behind Qitara now, touching her shoulder, the back of her neck.
Qitara nuzzles herself a little closer.
Kisket thinks it's funny.
She likes how it feels, how it smells.
Qitara likes to run it through her fingers.
It's gotten longer.
She leans forward and lets her head rest against Kisket's hair. 
She scoots closer and wraps her arms around Kisket's bony shoulders.
Qitara stops her massage.
Yes. Aren't you?
Kikset sighs.
"You're thinking about Iri?"
Qitara runs her hands down Kisket's arms.
Oh my.
"I'll wear the green dress for you."
Qitara rolls her eyes.
Well I guess I could go with you... I mean, with massages like these...
Qitara looks straight back, trying and failing to hide her smirk.
Qitara looks straight back, trying and failing not to smirk.
Kisket looks over her shoulder.
"Sorry, it looked like there was a mosquito."
Ow...
Qitara slaps Kisket's shoulder.
Oh, I thought I was gonna ask Shanta, you know, before Tracy gets to her.
"Of course you are," Qitara smiles.
Oh am I?
"You're going to be my date."
What about it?
"How about the wedding?!"
So?
"So..."
She presses down and runs her hands down Kisket's back, making her lean forward.
Qitara rubs her hands together for a moment then sets them on Kisket's shoulders.
Kisket sits on the edge of the bed, in front of Qitara.
"There we are," Qitara claps. "Hellooo, sunshine."
Kisket cracks a small smile.
She pats the space in front of her.
Qitara backs up on her knees on her bed.
{ Qitara - 2 }
Tracy stalks off, leaving Raros alone in his doorway.
Tracy shouts from down the hallway, walking backwards.
{ Tracy - 4 }
Tracy walks out of sight.
shit.
Tracy bumps into the wall.
fuck!
something!
or take polya with you
or something!
i'll fuckin... kick your ass!
Tracy shouts from down the hallway
you better ask someone out raros!
Tracy stalks off, leaving Raros alone in his doorway
i'm sorry i dont know what i was thinking.
order some flowers and shit for shanta, or something stupid
and like
im just gonna go to my room.
He swallows.
alright!
Tracy bolts upright.
god dammit.
and with all this with iri.
i shouldnt have said anything.
im sorry i fucking.
fuck!
Tracy rests his forehead against the hallway wall.
fuck. fuck.
i fucking said everything.
i wasnt supposed to say any of that.
...
so.
and amaranthe's only been missing for like two weeks.
its a month and a half old.
but if it is, uh.
it COULD not be her.
we havent gotten results
they're dna testing it now.
...
that had been cut up to complete shit.
and there was a head in there
then we checked the freezer
and.
we think is amaranthe's
that.
and we found a rotten hand
and all her food was spoiled.
and we looked in her fridge.
Tracy's face starts looking very pained.
Tract frowns.
and we found all her stuff.
and like. looking around.
well we ended up kicking her door in
okay so remember when kisket and i went to check on amaranthe, and we said she wasnt home?
Tracy lets out a breath
Raros nods slowly.
you swear?
on god ok? kisket doesnt want to fuck everyone up any more than they already are.
like
but its the same shit
well qitara will kill me but kisket'll make her do it
kisket will fucking kill me
cause you can't like tell anyone
AAAAAAAA
FUUUUUUUUUCK
ABANDON SHIP
AAAAAAA

o god its bad agaiiin
promise?
ok don't say anything yet ok?
Tracy shakes his head.
uh.
Tracy turns around and starts to leave.
nevermind.
fuck
uH.
He looks horrified.
Tracy covers his mouth.
especially after the thing with amara- ahk!
i dont know. this whole wedding thing is a good opportunity.
and i was thinking you looked like you liked the porcea chick.
you gotta find some way to stay happy dude
but, fuck, dont worry about me
and if that doesnt work i'll probably be like, dead or something.
i'm gonna ask shanta first, like as a matter of principle, if not i'll see if tobin would want to come, or maybe her hot goth looking friend, and if they're busy i'll ask elesa, and if pringle asks her first-or looks like totally depressed-i'll ask veruvi.
so what? unless you've got someone else in mind
tracy frowns
yea yea
yea yea
you should totally ask her out
you know the one
the snake lady from the godhead
you should get that gp chick
apparently everyones gonna bring dates

yo, dude.
hey.
raros, bro.
dude, raros.
dude.
raros, hey.
raros, hey.
hey
hey
bro, raros.
Tracy waves the letter.
bro.
raros, dude.
Tracy waves a wedding invitation.
hey, raros.
He takes off the headphones he put on 13 minutes ago.
Tracy clears his throat.
He's starting to get fed up with Raros blatantly ignoring him.
Tracy's been leaning against Raros' door frame for a solid 15 minutes.
{ Tracy - 4 }
One hand absently fiddles with her necklace.
Veruvi nods.
I.. Uh, I mean.
Uh, ok...
Uh, Hi? What are y9u uhh.
Veruvi slams her laptop closed.
{ Tobin - 4 }
Tobin takes a swig of ice water, then stands, "Yeah, lets go."
"Shall we go?" Ashley says.
Tobin nods as she swallows the last piece of melon.
"These skin drawings are cool though, I didn't know that was a thing humans did."
She adjusts her posture and her expression in the mirror. She exchanges her animated appearance for one more aloof and bored looking.
She slouches over to a mirror by the stairs to the upper level of Tobin's flat.
Ashley shrugs and stands up.
Ashley raises a pierced eyebrow, "I see."
"If you do," Tobin says, "which you won't, I'll buy your clothes and you'll pay me back later." 
A smirk begins to spread across Ash's face.
"Please don't," Tobin sighs.
"If I blow all my money on art supplies, then we can skip the clothes shopping though, right?"
"You can't go everywhere looking homeless, you know." Tobin eats another melon cube.
Ashley rolls her deep green eyes. 
"You're also gonna need a nice outfit, for the meeting."
"Ooh, now that's how it's done."
Tobin waves a hand, "Nah, we'll have them deliver it to our ship."
"We're gonna have a lot to carry, should we bring suitcases?"
"Yeah."
Ash beams, "You'll show me the art store?"
"I figured we'd go shopping."
"Ok."
"We've got the city to ourselves," Tobin says between mouthfuls of melon.
We've got the city to ourselves," Tobin says between mouthfuls of melon.
"So what's the plan for today?" She asks.
"So what's the plan for today?"
Ashley grins.
"But I can't stop either, oh god, I hate it."
She eats another.
Tobin shakes her head, "I cant handle sour!"
"It's good, isn't it?" Ash says.
Ashley smiles from across the table.
"Did you squeeze a lemon on that?!"
"Holy fuck!"
She shivers a little.
She chews, then her face scrunches up.
Tobin places a cube of melon in her mouth.
{ Tobin - 4 }
They bust open a bottle of champagne
{ Sirie - 9 }
They bust open a bottle of champaign
Sirie joins in the hug. Veruvi grins.
Y9u're 6ack.
Y9u're 6ack.
Veruvi smiles
Y9u're back.
Sirie takes a picture.
They hug.
Veruvi steps over to catch him.
Sirie pushes Mars forward and he stumbles.
Veruvi doesn't say anything.
Don't.
No um.
S9rry.
Mars looks at his feet
Y9u're sh9rter.
You changed your hair. It looks good.
Veruvi nods again
Are you okay?
Veruvi nods and its imperceptibly small.
I-uh. Heard about everything.
She slips past them and watches from the kitchen.
Sirie grins.
Veruvi stands there
Mars stands there
Her eyes swipe over the room before stopping on Mars.
Veruvi steps through the door.
"Hey!" Sirie says, "Come on in."
Veruvi's wearing a pair of green pants and a black jacket. She's fiddling with the gem on her necklace.
She grins
Sirie opens it.
He watches her walk to the door.
Mars stands up with Sirie, anyway.
"Lemme get that." Sirie smiles.
They both look at the door.
"Knock knock knock!"
Sirie writes down the number.
"Of course."
It's different?
"I'm sure Faye would love to hear from you, Let me give you her number."
"Well, good. You're doing well for yourself."
Sirie looks at Mars. She tilts her head.
I'm a reticle, for monad, now.
I can't stay, though.
Mars' face has been locked in an uncomfortable frown for the past fifteen minutes.
Right.
"She hasnt said anything, of course, but she's missed having you around."
"She's had some tough times. Things hvent really been working out for her. I'm glad you're here though, She's going to be so happy."
"She's had some tough times. She found a lot of things that dI'm glad you're here though, She's going to be so happy.
"So that's the gist of it," Sirie forces a smile.

Neon stands up and walks out of view.
&gt;Great.&lt;
&gt;No?&lt;
&gt;Okay we're fuckin' done here for today, that's enough. If you wanna send us questions, ask away on any of those garbage fuck social websites. Our P.O. Box is in the description if you have more fan art for me. Uhhh. Anything else?&lt;
&gt;Uh the best cook would have to be... Alex? I don't know that one's a shot in the dark. He looks like he could cook really well. Maybe Malenquious or Artifis? I don't know. None of them hold a fucking candle to Red.&lt;
&gt;Hah, I can't cook at all.&lt;

Neon laughs.
&gt;'Fuck, mary, kill: Ludovica, Kate, Artifis.'&lt;
&gt;Okay.&lt;
&gt;It's literally just the letter T.&lt;
&gt;This is a letter from "T."&lt;
&gt;Next one.&lt;
&gt;I don't know actually, they're both my favorites.&lt;
&gt;Tobin! Or Vica! Uh. Both of them?&lt;
Neon pulls out another letter. "This is from Solair, 'Hey Neon, who's your best friend on the Marche Slave?'"
&gt;You can't see Kate coming, and I'd say that's way more dangerous.&lt;
&gt;Cause like, Susett would destroy Kate in a fight, but like, you can see Susett coming.&lt;
&gt;If we're just talking like how dangerous. And not who would win in a fight.&lt;
Edited previous message: &gt;Um, not counting myself........... Probably................ Vica. But nobody wants to hear that, so.... Maybe Kate&lt;
&gt;Um, not counting myself........... Probably............
&gt;Don't quote me on that.&lt;
&gt;Well, obviously me. Like, duh. I'm also the coolest, the funniest, the smartest, and the best looking.&lt;
&gt;This is from BamfBoi69, 'Who's the most dangerous person in Horror Squad?'&lt;
Neon pulls out another letter.
&gt;Beat's me.&lt;
Neon looks straight into the camera and shrugs.
Edited previous message: &gt;Okay, it says, 'What even is horror squad anyway?'&lt;
&gt;Okay, it says, 'What even is horror squad anyway.'&lt;
Neon opens it.
&gt;We've got a letter from... Lizzie.&lt;
&gt;Okay NEXT!&lt;
Neon thinks for a little while longer.
&gt;She's attractive enough.&lt;
&gt;I dunno, maybe. It could be entertaining.&lt;
Neon thinks.
&gt;Now, would I have like a... romantic... Sort of relationship with her?&lt;
&gt;She's fun to fuck with cause she's so easy, you know? Plus she's really bad at putting on a tough girl act. It's fun to watch.&lt;
&gt;Uhh, Kate's alright, I didn't think people would be like... Shipping... that shit, wow.&lt;
&gt;Holy fuck.&lt;
Then Neon laughs.
Her face changes from impassive to one of total surprise.
&gt;A ship? What is that?&lt; Neon looks off screen.
&gt;This is from GlueGurl69, 'Hey Neon I drew a picture of you! I hope you like it!'&lt; Neon smiles. &gt;So I wanted to know what's up with you and Kate? Is that a real ship or something?&lt;
Neon pulls out the letter.
&gt;There's also a letter in here.&lt;
&gt;This is awesome. It's of me, I'm gonna put this in my room.&lt;
&gt;This one comes with a picture.... Is this fan art? Holy shit!&lt;
&gt;Okay! Next one.&lt; Neon opens a larger envelope.
&gt;Like, fuck, that's not a fun question.&lt;
&gt;I... Don't know... I wasn't really expecting to have to... Uh.... Talk about her?&lt;
&gt;Uh....&lt;
&gt;................................Seriously?&lt;
&gt;Can I skip this one?&lt;
Neon's face contorts into a mix of horror, fury, and disgust.
&gt;This is from Char17. It says, 'Hey Neon you're so cool!' Aw, thanks... 'When are you gonna tell us about Red?'&lt;
&gt;Okay next question.&lt; Neon opens another letter.
Edited previous message: &gt;Would you eat your motherfucking macaroni painting? No. So I'm not gonna eat anything I kill. You fucking idiot.&lt;
&gt;Would you eat your fucking macaroni painting? No. So I'm not gonna eat anything I kill. You fucking idiot.&lt;
&gt;You don't eat art.&lt;
&gt;Lemme put it this way.&lt;
Neon frowns.
&gt;I eat food. I don't even eat very much meat, why does everyone assume I'm some kind of carnivore?&lt;
&gt;No I don't eat the people I kill who the fuck would do something like that. I'm not a goddamn barbarian.&lt;
She takes a deep breath.
She puts down the letter.
Neon's eyes narrow.
&gt;Hi Neon, I'm a big fan! So I was wondering, You're like the only person who's never been mentioned eating, so I was wondering, what do you eat? Like do you eat the people you kill or something crazy like that?&lt;
&gt;Um.&lt;
&gt;Alright, okay, our first question comes from XxXKushSempai420XxX on... Twitter... what the fuck...&lt;
&gt;Fine. But you better get rid of this shit before I do another one of these.&lt;
She rolls her eyes.
Neon waits for a reply from off-screen.
&gt;I don't wanna sit here and open a hundred letters when I can go through two hundred comments in the same amount of time.&lt;
&gt;Everything we got was online, you guys just printed everything and put it into envelopes to make this shit as frustrating as possible for me.&lt;
&gt;What the fuck is with all the letters and shit?&lt;
&gt;Actually hold on.&lt;
She pulls a letter from the stack and opens it.
&gt;Now since they put me on the first fuckin episode, I've got a lot of questions to get through, so lets not waste any time, yeah?&lt;
&gt;I'll be your host for today, but it'll be someone totally different next week!&lt;
Neon puts her feet down and leans into the table.
&gt;Where we take time out of our days to read and answer all your wonderful comments and questions.&lt;
&gt;Hello! And welcome to our new series: Fan Mail!&lt;
"Alright lets get this over with..." She mumbles.
She flips through them a couple times.
Neon scowls at a set of flash cards in her hands.
Neon's sitting in large leather chair, her feet kicked up on a mahogany desk that is absolutely covered in envelopes, letters, and packages.

Sirie's grin gets even wider.
Mars is sitting on her couch with a cup of coffee in his hands.
She looks up from her phone.
Sirie presses send.
"You'll never guess who I met in the hangar today!!" She types.
Sirie opens up her messages with Veruvi. She texts with a grin.

They leave the hangar as four.

"Ah, uh. Nice to meet you Liz," Tobin says.
Liz stands on her toes, "Lisette Wells, at your service."

yeah for sure.
"We should definitely hang out this week though." Tobin says.
"Yeah, so she's staying at my place for a week while we shop for supplies and stuff..." Tobin nods, "Then we'll be leaving again."
oh shit
"She's gonna be the art director for my next movie." Tobin whispers.
"...Likewise," Ashely says."
nice to... uh, meet you.
Ashley isn't even looking at them, she's distracted by something in the distance.
Tobin smiles, "That'd be me. This is my friend Ashley." Tobin indicates the woman.
Liz stands up and narrows her eyes. "Which one of you is Tobin?"
She doesn't say anything about it though.
Tobin's eyebrows raise.
im... good.
Tobin waves a hand to Tracy. "Hey! How are ya' doin' dude?"
Tobin's long bangs are tied into a short braid over her chest.
The woman's shoulders and arms are  covered in tatoos of tree branches, She has snow white hair that looks dyed.
A ferry arrives in fifteen minutes, and Tobin exits with a human woman.
Tracy waits while Liz talks.
Liz follows him.
He walks to a nearby bench and sits down.
Tracy doesn't say anything.
"I live a fast life, Trace. You of all people would know that." Liz grins.
it was like two seconds! how do you get bored in two seconds?!
"What?" Liz looks offended, "I got bored."
i swear to god, don't fucking do that.
Tracy wheels around.
"So who's this Tobin, your new space girlfriend?"
Tobin hangs up.
"Sweet!" Tobin answers, "I'll tell the pilot to hurry his ass up."
"Hey Tobin, I'm at the hangar," Tracy says.
She answers after one ring.
He calls Tobin.
Tracy walks out of earshot then pulls out his phone.
wait here I'll be back in a sec.
Tracy leads Liz to the hangar.
"Uh, alright?"
follow me, okay?
just  fuckin.
you know what, no.
shut the fuck up.
Liz narrows her eyes at Tracy.
i didn't say that.
"You're NOT gonna give me money?"
that's assuming that i'm gonna give you money.
"I was gonna figure that out after I got some money from you."
i- no, i- do you even have a place to sleep tonight?
He rubs his face with his hands.
Tracy turns around.
Liz shrugs. "Pretty please?"
no sweet talking or anything?
wow straight to the point, huh?
"So will you lend me some money?"
what the fuck.
Liz looks at Tracy.
Tracy looks at the girl.
"Like maybe within an hour of me getting here." Liz says, shamelessly.
and you blew all your money?
Edited previous message: "I just got here this morning."
I just got here this morning.
...how long have you ben out here, liz?
"So anyway, I accidentally blew all my money on some super delicious alien lunch and was freaking out until I realized, 'hey, I actually know someone who lives in space!' and I started looking for you."
"Right?! It's fucking dumb!"

"I moved out of the house cause I wanted to explore... But Earth money really isn't even worth crap in credits..."

Tracy's brow furrows a bit.
She looks like she's seventeen or eighteen, blonde haired, blue eyed, light skinned.
He looks over at the girl. She waves.
He nods.
Tracy starts to say something, then he stops.
He points at the human girl, who's waiting patiently for them. "Get this crazy bitch away from me, she was asking for you at first, but she just won't stop talking now."
Quarria beckons Tracy over.
hey quarria, what's up?
Tracy frowns as he makes his way to Quarria.
Quarria is at the board being grilled by a very excited human girl.

"Okay, yeah, uh, bye!"

"Awesome! We'll see you soon then."
for sure, i gotta see quarria first, but i'll head over there afterward.
Tracy shrugs to himself as he walks.
"Cool, well I'm about to land on Zenithon with a friend in like, an hour, do you want to meet us at the hangar?"
yeah, pretty sure.
"Hi Tracy, are you free today?"

Tracy shuts the front door of their old apartment
Then he gets off his bed, puts on a pair of shoes and heads out.
Tracy looks at the door for a little while longer.
Kisket leaves.

Alright.

To go to the bounty board.

Tracy tears off his headphones.
Tracy!
Kisket takes a breath.
It wasn't really that much louder.
Tracy.
He clearly didn't hear Kisket.
Tracy's sitting cross-legged on his bed with his laptop. He looks like he's listening to music.

She's been getting a lot of texts from Quarria lately, so this isn't very surprising.

Really.
She's really enjoying it.
Following it helps Aradia really feel like she's improving.
But aside from that, it's a busy schedule.
She has Friday through Sunday off, of course, and missions take priority over anything when she gets assigned to them.
Much more loaded than it used to be, but Aradia has found herself really enjoying it.
That's her schedule.
Aradia doesn't need to take those classes; Mars doesn't take any of them, even though she's been trying her hardest to pester him into joining the history course.
Chemistry, physics, and on Mondays only, a course on Monad history.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, though, she takes night classes.
On most days, after all her combat oriented classes, she has the rest of the day to herself.
But as long as she's killing the right people, for a good cause, she thinks it's okay.
It might.
Aradia wonders sometimes if that makes her a horrible person.
And they're practically useless for anything aside from killing.
They might be one of her favorite parts about herself.
She'll never say it, but Aradia loves her oxium powers.

If she took a tray from the food court, she'll return it.
After breakfast, she'll brush her teeth, shower, dry off, brush her hair, dry her hair, get dressed, and head out.
While she eats her breakfast, she might watch something on television, listen to music of some sort, maybe a book on tape, it doesn't really matter, it's mostly for background noise.
She walks to the food court before most people are awake, picks something out, then brings it with her back to her room.

Without saying a word to anyone, she finds her way to her ship, starts it up, and leaves the planet.
Then she leaves the bathroom, slides on a pair of worn jeans, stuffs her belongings in her bags, and leaves the room.
She washes her face too.
She stands up and begins to rinse out her mouth again.
Red sighs.
The same flakes of blood she'd seen earlier were now crumbling under her nail.
She sticks a finger in her mouth and scratches along the inside of her dry cheek.
If she had to guess, she had been dead for two or three hours.
The remains of its contents have all but dried, leaving tiny wet patches in and around the cracks of the stone floor.
Sometime, during the course of her episode, she had knocked over the glass of water.
She looks around.
It's noon, or sometime around then.
When she opens them, the sun is streaming through the bathroom's skylight.
She closes her eyes.
And suddenly she can't feel anything.
And the burning and prickling begins to ease away.
How the throbbing begins to slow
How the pace of the throbbing quickens, and how it makes her breath hitch in her throat.
She can't think of anything but the burning and how it throbs.
It burns a lot.
Her mouth is wet, her chest burns.
She coughs a little, and a few red droplets land on her legs.
Edited previous message: Her heart lurches and her body shudders uncontrollably.
Her heart lurches and her body shudders uncontrolably.
An itch in her throat, a prickle on the back of her tongue.
Red doesn't feel much.
She waits even longer.
Nobody comes to knock on her bedroom door.
She waits for a long time.
She leans back and waits.
She takes a sip, then puts the glass on the bathroom floor by the tub.
Red frowns at the glass.
The little boy named Xol had brought her water before she went to bed. Red had thanked him, he asked for a story about his dad and she had obliged.
The youngest one.
One of the children.
No.
By a maid of some sort?
It was brought to her before she went to sleep.
She inspects the glass in her hands.
Red sits in it.
The tub is made of granite and polished to perfection.
With the glass in hand, she walks back into the bathroom.
Red frowns.
It doesn't smell like anything in particular.
She smells it.
She picks up the glass of water on her bedstand.
Aside from a few flecks on her pillow, there isn't any blood on her bed.
Red checks her bed.
After three or four more washes she walks back into her bedroom.
She spits it out, and repeats the process.
She takes another sip of water and holds it in her mouth, letting it wash over every crevice.
She watches the blood mix with the water in the basin. It swirls down the drain.
She spits into the sink
The idea crystalizes in her head.

"Oh fuck," Kisket and Tracy both say.
Her eyes widen.
She opens the freezer.
She reaches over for the freezer door.
Kisket covers her mouth.
There's a hand in the fridge. It's begun to rot, and has become totally unrecognizable.
"What?" Kisket asks, she follows Tracy's line of sight, she has to lean over toward him to see it.
Kisket stops smelling the milk, it definitely isn't the source.
"Holy shit, Tracy says."
Kisket pulls out a carton of expired milk and smells it.
There is lettuce, that looks bad, but it isn't the source of the smell, a few moldy berries, but those aren't the source either.
But something in there stinks terribly.
It's full of food.
She opens the fridge.
I wanted to check this too.
Kisket heads back to the fridge.
Kisket nods.
that's not normal.
Kisket and Tracy look at each other.
It contains all of Amaranthe's gear.
Tracy pulls out the suitcase and opens it.
There's a suitcase, an umbrella, a couple coats and a box labeled "Stuff."
They head to the living room closet.
Lets check the closet out here too.
Kisket frowns.
Hey Kis, I found a couple of Amaranthe's guns in her closet.
Tracy comes out of the bedroom.
She heads to the fridge.
The fridge has two sides, divided vertically, Kisket assumes the right is the refrigerator and the left is the freezer.
The counter doesn't have any sponges or dish soap on it.
There's an unopened pack of sponges next to two unopened bottles of dish soap.
She checks the cabinets, they're all stocked with essentials.
Kisket is in the kitchen.
He looks for Kisket.
Tracy heads back to the closet and finds two unloaded rifles.
There's a gun under the pillow, it's loaded.
He lifts up the pillow on the left side of the bed, the right side looking to be the side Amaranthe sleeps in.
He leaves the closet and looks around.
There are two, right next to a half full laundry hamper.
He checks the closet for suitcases.
Tracy frowns.
There's an array of products under the sink, pills, medicine, floss and the like in the cabinet above the sink.
There's a toothbrush in it's toothbrush holder next to the bathroom sink.
Clothes are hung up, looking mostly untouched.
There's nobody in the bathroom, or the bedroom closet.
It's empty. The bed is unmade, but it doesn't look like it has been slept in recently.
Kisket and Tracy walk past the open closet and into the bedroom.
All the doors are wide open; they can see a bit of Amaranthe's bedroom just past the kitchen bar.
Kisket and Tracy enter the apartment.
There are several lamps and lights around the apartment, but they're all off.
There are two couches, set perpendicular to each other, one is plush and red, the other is light grey.
The walls are cream colored, and the floor is made of dark mahogany with olive tile in the kitchen.
The blinds are closed and sunlight filters through, making it appear dull and grey.
Kisket looks inside Amaranthe's living room. Dust kicked up from the door swirls in the air, a piece of tissue paper floats across the floor.
He kicks it two more times before the handle snaps and the door swings open.
The wood around the handle cracks, and the door rattles.
Tracy walks up and kicks the door handle.
fuck this shit.
okay what is this, the eighth time you've knocked now?
Kisket knocks again.
There is no answer.
Tracy scratches his head.
Kisket knocks on the door of Amaranthe's apartment.

He zones out again to thoughts of killing and violence.
Vox turns back out the window.
"You can wait here until then."
Kisket frowns more.
"How about we wait for your amphiron partner to get here before I answer that."
Vox frowns behind his mask.
She looks the most uncomfortable he's ever seen anyone.
Vox looks at Kisket.
"My friend Veruvi... Wants to know why you're here and uh... What you're doing to her family." Kisket frowns.

Vox takes his hand off his neck.
"And why you killed everyone else."
"You want to know why her?"
Vox scratches his neck.
"About a girl you saved, named Qitara."
"About what?" Vox grumbles.
Vox waves a hand, and the guards leave the room.
"I... I'm Kisket," She says. "I have something I want to ask you."
His soldiers are getting uncomfortable.
They look at each other for a long time.
Neither does she.
He doesn't say anything.
He's seen this woman before, with Shanta. He doesn't know her name.
Two of his men are escorting a female human. Their weapons are trained on her, and one of them is carrying her equipment.
He turns.
The door to the bridge opens and the unexpected sound grab's Vox's attention.
Vox zones out for fifteen minutes, just staring out the window and thinking.
What a pain in the ass.
Like making sure his terogoid soldiers don't kill themselves unnecessarily, as they love to do.
But he can't right now, because there are more important things to monitor.
He wants to pull flesh off of bones with his teeth.
Vox supposes that's his problem, right now. He's in a strangely violent mood. He wants to rip and cut and crush and tear and break. 
Anyone who'd be worth speaking to, at least, Etainien would only ignore him, and his wife hates talking about violence.
But with Tashen half a galaxy away, he's left without anyone to speak to.
Maybe not.
Maybe he'd comment on the ship that had landed on the cliffs across the field and taken off so quickly.
He might comment on Zazani or the show she is putting on.
He wouldn't be brave enough to suggest they had picked the wrong side, though he'd certainly think so.
He thinks for a moment what Tashen might say right now.
The planet beneath his ship is consumed in fire and death.
He's looking out the window, hands clasped behind his back, silent.
Vox stands at the helm of his ship.

"That's what makes it so awesome," Set grins. "How about it?"
"I know right!"
That sounds very not safe.
"Basically you atomize yourself and everything you have on you and move instantly to a nearby location in your field of view."
"Oh that one's super cool, it just passed all the safety regulation tests."

Then he nods.
Mars hesitates.

"What do you say, do I have your consent to move forward with this.
"Which is what this whole experiment is all about, in the end." Khessi shrugs.
"More implants means more active powers, which means more battlefield versatility."
"So, as long as we're only using thoroughly tested, safe implants, I'm pretty sure you should be able to handle three fine. From there, we'll slowly move you up slowly to five as you acclimate to it."

"What do you mean by that?"
"Anyway," Khessi spins in her chair. "How comfortable do you think you'd be trying using multiple implants at once?"

"Hmm, Geda was being real careful, huh. Doesn't look like he trusted you at all."

"Good, that's good. Right now, you only have corrosion though, right?"
Nope, all clear.

"What about the other way around?"
No not yet.

She heads to the microwave.
Tobin gets up from the couch.
"Hang on I'll be right back."
[ Horror Squad: Tobin - 2 ]
"What the fuck is this noise?" He says.
Mars steps out from the other side of the forest
Kisket and Qitara follow Raros.
Veruvi is knocked out, face down in the grass.
"What did you do?!"
"What the fuck, Tracy?!" Qitara shouts
Kisket and Qitara are cuddled up on a rock.
what the fuck.
here we fucking gooooooooooo
Tracy's head streamers light on their own.
dude fuck yeah!
fuck yeah
come on come on lets go
lemme use it dude you gotta
He shakes him a bit.
Tracy grabs both of Ohn's arms.
lemme use it.
it works, right?!
it works?!
shut the fuck up lemme use your time machine!
shut the fuck up lemme use your time machine
he's doing what?
yeah
...
he totally explained it wrong
why does that make sense
make sense?
what.
"EEP!" She shouts. "I-um, excuse me..."
Qitara laughs so hard she snorts from the other room.
oh hi polya
Tracy sighs.
or beer day in august
international fried chicken day
i guess i could wait for like...
it's more uncomfortable than amir in a stripclub.
the most uncomfortable thing ever.
this thing is like
It snaps back into place.
Tracy pulls on a cord of the jockstrap.
and take off this stupid outfit.
cry
go away im gonna go to my room and....
you're making me depressed
no
that's depressing
man i had the whole day planned out
nobody celebrates the fourth of july in australia...
...
the fourth greatest american holiday
i missed it.
i...
His streamers are no longer lit.
Tracy looks at Raros.
Tracy is walking dejectedly down the hallway.
Qitara laughs really hard.
Uh huh.
We're a group of people now?
Qitara covers her mouth and tries not to laugh.
Yup.
Except Tracy missed the Fourth of July...
Another one of those holiday parties?
Kisket shrugs
Kisket watches the hallway for a couple seconds, then Qitara un-pauses their movie, and Kisket goes back to enjoying her day.
His head drops, and he walks back down the hallway.
Tracy opens his mouth, then closes it.
His hands fall to his sides.
He drops the t-shirt cannon.
Tracy's face falls slack.
Tracy, it's July fifth.
The room is quiet.
Kisket and Qitara stare at him.
hAPPY FOURTH OF JULY MOTHERFUCKERS!
He's holding a t-shirt cannon, which he fires twice into the room.
Tracy appears at the door, wearing nothing but a jockstrap two American flag sashes across his chest. He's got a headband wrapped around a pair of streamers poking out from his head.
Veruvi slides past the door to the hallway. Sliding out of view just as soon as she slides into view.
A little softer, comes Veruvi's voice, "Tracy what the fu- AHGK!"
Suddenly, the two of them hear a loud thump from down the hallway.
Everything is nice.
Kisket smiles.
Qitara giggles at a joke in the movie.
Everyone is either out or occupied.
They're watching a movie on Kisket's laptop.
Kisket and Qitara are curled up on the couch in the living room.
{ Independence Day }
{ Kisket - 4 }
They leave.
Kisket slips the tissue under the door.
Okay.
Um.
Maybe after the whole thing with....
She didn't say anything about leaving.
I don't know.
I...
I get kinda nervous, standing in front of people's doors for too long.
Lets go home.
She writes, "Feel better! -Kisket &amp; Shanta"
Kisket takes a pice of tissue out of her jacket pocket.
I'll leave a note on her door or something.
Maybe she's sick or something.
I guess so.
Kisket knocks louder.
No response.
They wait.
It's Kisket and Shanta...
Amaranthe?
Kisket knocks on the door.
Well, the door doesn't look broken or anything.
They reach 3F.
The hallway is brightly lit.
They take the stairs up to the third floor.
Good call.
Or stairs?
Elevator?
Amaranthe lives on the third floor. Apartment 3F.
Kisket looks at her phone.
A little on the older side, with tall stone walls and large windows.
It's a fairly chic looking building.
They make their way to Amaranthe's apartment.
Kisket nods.
Yeah it's in my phone.
I've never been to her house, but she's talked about it.
Pretty sure she lives in the Axis.
Right.
They head out.
Nevermind.
You're grabbing...
Kisket puts on a jacket.
Alright.
He wants us to check up on her.
Kisket frowns.
But he says he's left several messages at her house over the past couple weeks.
I was thinking, it's been a couple days, but that's pretty normal.
He was wondering if we'd seen Amaranthe around lately.
It's good... I just got a weird text from Quarria.
Hey, Shanta?
{ Kisket - 4 }
{ Bastien - 1 }
Bastien is placed in a psychiatric ward and scheduled for testing in a week.
He can&#x27;t recall his own name.
He doesnt remember anything.
His head hurts.
He is told by an officer about an unauthorized launch using his credentials and passwords from Hangar D.
Bastien respawns several hours later. His head hurts.
She turns off the cameras.
She enters the security room.
A minute and a half pass without any movement, then the prisioner leaves, with a pair of keys in her hands.
There are no cameras in the bathrooms.
She steps into the hall, and walks down to the bathroom across from the security room. She then enters the Men&#x27;s side.
The prisoner in cell 408 stands up, wipes the blood off her face, and pushes open her cell door.
The security room is now empty.
-----------------------------
He got up, straightened his clothes, grabbed his keys, and locked the security room as he left.
He had to use the bathroom.
Cayne looked away.
"Fuck..." He said to himself.
With a quick glance at the screen, he confirmed what he&#x27;d already suspected. The cell was covered in the girl&#x27;s blood, splattered across the floor and the walls. Her face was a dark mess, and the prisoner&#x27;s green eyes stared straight into the screen, as if pleading for help.
He looked away, found some distraction and hadn&#x27;t looked back.
But after a while of watching he found he just couldn&#x27;t stand the sight anymore.
Bastien had been viciously beating the hell out of the prisoner in that cell, Neon, the entire time. He could understand the sentiment. Cayne had wanted to do that himself a couple times.
Cayne frowned.
Fifteen minutes could go by unnoticed. Maybe. But this was half a goddamn hour.
It had been a solid 30 minutes since then, that the cameras in unit 408 B hadn&#x27;t been recording. Which is an issue.
"It&#x27;ll only be like 15 minutes," Bastien had said, smiling, as he&#x27;d handed Cayne a fifteen hundred credit bribe.
  { Bastien - 1 }
{ Sekko - 1 }
"Yeah, probably."
Amaranthe turns to face her. "I think that's part of why it's fun. You get to fulfill that deadly blade dancing fantasy that you see in all the movies. To actually be that cool in real life? It must feel awesome."
"Yeah," Yvelte crosses her arms. She looks at a wildly designed dagger with fifteen spikes along it's edge, "It's all a little bit to edgy for me, honestly. Running around, and spinning and throwing things. Like you're trying to perform some movie choreography. Seems like a little too much effort."
"Really?"
Amaranthe perks up at that.
"If you wanted to learn, you could probably talk to Qitara. I think she only uses knives and blades and the like."
Amaranthe goes back to looking around.
"Yeah, they are I guess."
Amaranthe turns and visibly rolls her eyes before replying. "Look, just because I don't know two shits about using a knife in a gunfight doesn't mean I don't appreciate them. They're cool as fuck!"
"See, I thought you mostly used guns, Amy." Yvelte smiles.
A bell chimes as they enter through the glass door. Amaranthe waves at the shopkeeper and proceeds to "ooh" and "aah" at the fanciful knives in glass cases.
"Alright."
Edited previous message: Amaranthe grins, "You make a good team. Don't start putting yourselves in the past-tense. That's a bad sign." She looks away for a moment, "Ooh! Lets go in there!" She points at a fairly high-end looking dagger shop.
Amaranthe grins, "You make a good team. Don't start putting yourselves in the past-tense. That's a bad sign." She looks away for a moment, "Ooh! Lets go in there!" She points at a fairly high-end  looking dagger shop.
She thinks for a bit before continuing. "I don't know how our current arrangement came to be... I was mostly field testing Luden's different weapon designs. I guess he just really appreciated my feedback, because before I knew it I was working with him on everything. It felt natural too, we made a really good team."
Yvelte shrugs, "I was an agent for Dead Orbit for a good while actually, and then I took some courses for a proficiency in psionics. I wanted to do a little bit of Drop Trooper training as well, but I never got around to it, work with Luden started taking priority."
"So, what kind of, uhh, soldiery stuff did you do? Like that got you to being Luden's secret bodyguard wahtever?"
Amaranthe tries to instigate some small talk as they search for something interesting.
Yvelte nods again, and the two of them begin to check out the various weapon shops.
"Whatever though, right?" Amaranthe pats her on the shoulder, "Lets go shopping."
She thinks to herself for a little while.
Yvelte nods.
"Yeah," Amaranthe shrugs. "A swarm of angry mice coming to kill your boss? It'd be kinda funny, I guess, but I doubt they'd even be able to find the base anyway."
"Huh. That's not what I was expecting."
"Quarria called him an 'angry little mouse thing.' apparently he's got a team or something that isn't on Zenithon at the moment."
Yvelte nods, she expected as much. "Do we know who?"
"So, uh." Amaranthe starts, frowning. "Quarria told me that someone's taken the bounty on Luden."
They head over to one of the nearby benches and sit.
Amaranthe smiles as she says goodbye, then tows Yvelte back out of the crowd.
He nods his head and types something on the console.
Yvelte watches as Amaranthe talks to the waadigan at the counter, Quarria.
Amaranthe pulls Yvelte behind her as she wades through the growing crowd around the bounty board.

nice
but i just found out she’s actually psych pop or dream pop
it was julia holter
nah
you don’t worry too much about a half orc that looks like a half orc
in a world where changelings are a thing that just happen
it also definitely helps to link your backstory to a specific place
for sure
but im not gonna stick 100% by the source material 
eberron has a wiki yea
i don't have the most experience dming
that's fine
i don't really have anyone in my circle who can do a third game like me
i mean u can invite anyone u want
yea i saw it
lmao
i think my question kinda still stands :P
i see
lemme get on discord
and sure
2 why would he subject himself to that particular breed of torture
1 how?
wtf
it's kinda ridiculously distracting lol
are rly goin all out there
those subtitles
man
lmao
ic
post too
idk prog rock and prog metal are my favorites
damn
this is sick though
well tbh they were 80s too
i don't see why this wouldn't make it
if swans was releasing albums in the 70s
but honestly
unreleased
it says right there
it wasn't being released
but
holy
this song is awesome
cool
huh
no idea who he is
i have
i see
i don’t 
no
for a sec i thought you were talking about portal 2
p model
no bullshit
that look just like
but it does mean you could get movies with live action fight scenes that look like anime fight scenes
that seems like it'd need a lot of editing to stay coherent
so it's like just scan copied onto a screen from their mind
oh for film?
best mecha i've ever seen
LANCER
and you like mecha stuff?
and now we're back into cyberpunk everything is horrible
except people just pay to use the simulations instead of prostitutes
oh
or maybe you add some sort of touch sensitive suit, and boom, now you've got a scenario like ready player one
put people in imagination tanks during FTL travel or something
most of them are dystopian and make me hate people, tho
there are plenty of things you can do with that sorta tech
but i couldn't write a story about that
i mean i'd put it in my story
computers are just really shitty brains
esp in a world like ghost in the shell
then i could totally see it happening 
yeah once we have ways to map out thought processes
is it strictly visual?
i’d pay for that on my own
so what there are algorithms to digitally replicate your thoughts in a 3d environment?
huh
and heaven too, but it's harder to make a technologically advanced elysium interesting
im actually very excited for your characters to get to travel to my hell
i love that
"What school?" "I'm starting it." "huh?" "Yeah, my school" "Who tf are you?"
holy shit lol
hahah
nvm
holy shit that's really good
you just have to come up with the lie that your character tells everyone
?
is there a stupider reason than "because it looks cool"
well
you could apply an agent to make it all patina'd
with extra iron content
or you could just get one made for you
you could dye the blade black, though
may dull the blade
hmm
black paint?
cmon
you wanna play a sleazy warlock who parties all night every night and there's no red light district in your capital city?
sometimes it just doesn't happen like that
a barb, taverns with lots of options
if i have a thief i'll add shit to steal
if i have a sword nut pc i'll add collectors with special items
like if i have a bookworm pc im gonna throw in secret hidden libraries
i mean they run a game and expect the players to fit the mold of the game, rather than the game fitting the mold of the pcs
well hmm
hate it when dms don't run according to the players
i'll be sure to bust out an extensive array for you to go googly eyed over
it's a dangerous world filled with dangerous people out there, you'll see
so you'll have to self-moderate
that said, im also not gonna stop other people from killing your character &gt;.&gt;
i am not gonna stop you from playing your character
whatever's fun for you
go for it
talked mad game but just never had a good plan, even once
my 7 int 9 wis sorcerer
and i have played it
that one is fun
*will
never have and i neeeeever win
oof
i'd allow that
and that's rly funny bout the ronin
nice
im like mostly joking lmao
if i want my world to be believable, i just mean i can't have people just take being called a b-baka to their face lying down
that goes for everything, rly
ye
or they'll call the guards
just know that for the most part, if you hit someone, they'll hit back
 ok
yea that's chaotic good
neutral or chaotic?
so you'd say she's a good gal
what would be her outlook on organized crime syndicates?
cool, then we're in the clear
which is a good thing
cause they'll never turn out exactly as you want them to
i'll point out that it kinda always sucks playing characters that are very important to whatever you're doing with your stuff, at least in dnd
it makes my job easier if you're all similarly aligned
my job is to work with what you want to play and bring it together with everyone else
it can be whatever you want it to be
tru tru
yeah she could totally be from the starting town, nothing wrong with that
having some cool adventures and then making it there by like level 3
like i was thinking of having you start off in a small town travelling to one of the major cities
that said my stories start off with much more brass tracks, down to earth kinda stuff, you wouldn't be playing a big role in anything at all, until like level 4-5
or maybe to give back to the world for some wrong he committed
can always throw in an old sword master who moved away from all the major wars who took this strange half orc in because he is old and mysterious
i mean most dnd worlds will accomodate it
Eberron doesn’t have tiny towns
so like a small town folk hero?
or was it Kazchke
Katcha Kachke
*name
just the bame
sounds like one of the lore heroes of my story
demon slayer is so fucking sick
looks like cooler rose lalonde
my current one, Roman Kilgour is my best character i’ve had in a while
but
i try not to get too attached to my dnd characters as a rule
that bottom face is awesome
bruh
idc who id have to pay
pool would be the intro
if i ever turned my book into an anime
they’re sick
yes i do know tricot
what im hearing is he’s essentially a mega powerful foil to your mcs’ dad?
so
a bit preoccupied 
a bit preoccupied 
sry i was
bad one breaks it
a good villain makes a story 
thats good
are the magical rocks addictive?
magical rock addiction?
or age or smth?
guilt?
why’d he go insane?
oh right im dum
its a dnd term tbh
big bad evil guy
so is the bbeg a skorkk himself? or just well travelled?
i see
oh DVARVES
human types?
cool
who lives in skorkk
Skorkk
even if they do lose
if you’re coy about the plot i think it could work
especially in the mid to end game
that sounds like it could be pretty fun
the events precipitating the entire shitting up of the world as we know it?
so like
i see
and it’s chock full of organized crime
cause eberron is sick
also just an fyi i’ll def be using it and i’ll be using eberron as the setting 
and when would you place it?
i’ll put him in there
sounds good
C:
holy shit that sounds like a masterpiece 
d e a t h
t o
h o n k e y
t h a t
s p a n k
im sure they still have fans out there who remember them though
your dad and his bandmates share this super dope past together that's a kinda secret, just between them sorta deal
that's part of what makes it cool
that means it is normal though
you've got quite the jamming family/extrafamilial unit
it may take a while to get through it all
i will have to check this out
wow
fkn small world amirite?
wow
[1575096388] Taluss Athner (Kyle): Who actually did music for the 90s Felix the cat series, which my animation teacher was a storyboarder and director on lol

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
and
home
ok sor just got hime
sweeet
thats awesome
this is an awesome cover
oh rly?
and then people fuckin go and sample them for their huge blowout pop songs and reap all the benefits 
they’re always the ones trying new shit and pushing the boundaries 
i tend to like the unknown bands a lot more is the thing
thats sick
and then started making their music videos
saw run dmc and shit
my dad’s more of a jazz/blues/80s-90s rap guy
yea yea
but she likes it quiet
well not basic
yeah my mom has kinda basic taste in music
awesome 
so its hard to get people to actually read him
and of them all i think its not even top 10
the problem is that 1q84 is easily his most famous book
i guzzle his books like fkn water man
what has she read?
murakami is the best
ye see, i can barely get em to finish a 200 page book
but i did binge watch the boys with my mom over a weekend
mine are generally too busy
your parents have exceedingly good taste
fk
i think my mom might be into like satoshi kon movies at most
my mom kinda liked spirited away
akira is rly fantastic 
i just assume the worst
lol
OHHH
ah so it was end of eva?
with cowboy bebop, big O, and the old fma
my dad got me into anime tho
my mom doesn’t really touch that stuff
flcl is a god tier anime tho
thats an achievement 
hfs
wait she’s 62 and you did that?
awesome
lol thats kinda awesome 
actually, have you seen critical role?
have you showed them critical role?
my mom was even the slightest bit curious
man i wish
:0
your mom is curious about dnd?
is your mom a fan of fantasy rpg type stuff?
it’s probably rly good
then i rly have no right to try to stop you from dropping 86 on something with actual content
i’ll have to look at reviews 
hm
thats kinda sick
but if it’s players only
cause it kinda sounds like an absolute nightmare?
i can’t imagine wanting to dm that
oh that helps it a bit
theres a game master, right?
idk it could be good
personally i already spend too much money on fancy dice
thats weird
huh
almost always
card draw kinda ruins it for me
damn
ohhh cards
it’s essentially dnd but with all the pieces provided for you
is it a board game at that point?
for a board game
86 is a fkn lot
saw an ad for this on crit role
oh i know this
gloomhaven?
i need to find that song now
wtf
well
ok
probably not
no
loving captain beefheart rn

this is awesome
ok im listening to beefheart
saharan blues sounds cool as hell
no
actually leaf house is rly good nvm
idk you may not need to
i mean when it comes to anco i literally only listen to hey light and leaf house
yeeah
they’re not animalistic enough imo
im not a huge anco fan
which one?
for me
that and rym
but they’re also complete idiots
 /mu generally knows all the gems
my jam?
sounds like
but their name alone makes me like them
i haven’t actually heard them
s w e e t
oh that’s sweet
i getchya
yeah
cause la is just not a pretty place
well if you’re rich and a stoner/surfer you’d go somewhere else to get stoned and surf
you hate it, or you’re rich, or you’re a stoner/surfer
growing up there its either
la is a great city to be on your own in
thats good then
well
oh noooo
seattle is sf if sf wasn’t dominated by the tech corpos
im unlikely to go outside at all
and washington is the best state after california 
portland is a sick city
thatd be cool
which is ok
it’s nice and cool from like late fall to late spring
hate sun and heat?
and theres a lotta that going on in LA
thatd be cool
ic
or more for personal use?
looking for jobs in the design field then?
that’s very cool
school is bs in how unspecific it can be
plus its very specialized
thats pretty cool
which school?
oh whaaat
id probably start it over winter break anyway
ahhhh ic
what times would you be available?
so
i currently havent asked anyone else
ye
im in 2 rn, running this would make 3
being in 2 isn’t all that hard
lmao
don’t wanna get it wrong
i don’t know your setting enough 
so not yet
if anything
but im still not sure what i’d run
i was gonna ask if you wanted to play in a campaign i may run
actually nvm
nvm
now that im thinking bout it
hmm
damn, happens pretty often though
wow that’s awesome 
hows the list coming?
rly
the only ones i don’t consistently skip are eva ops, cowboy bebop, and samurai champloo
but i tend to skip most ops
maybe im a blasphemer
i see
*the
shit grates on tbe eardrums 
squeaky voices suck
you’re right tho
i mean
its a good op
its aight
oooooooooooooooohhhh
you haven’t watched black lagoon?
lol nice
sugarcubes is the bomb
yeye
i love this
when my ears need a break from  brutal assault of rampaging basasses with anger issues
oh here
he knows how to fuckin run a campaign more than anyone else
matt coleville is the guy to watch
if you really want to go through with it
can't know without testing
try it out
but it's designed with balance in mind
the whole spell slots thing is weird
idk
or you could just not rework it
the magic system is reworkable
oh right
if eberron can be eberron in 5e then you can fuckin do whatever
time period is an easy fix
but it's a looooootta work
you could
which is its own beast
and shadowrun
sick as hell but it's gundam esque mech combat
which just came out
rn there's lancer
s' why i wish there was a good system for sci-fi
yeh dnd will force you to do that
but you could definitely use dnd experiences to like create more background lore and flesh out the world more for yourself
you don't want to run your story in dnd form
yeah that's what made me think of it in the first place
yea i can see it
af
mad
she looks
next week looks good
so if you believe that the whole rain making you sick thing is a hoax you’re prob right
i firmly believe that belief shapes ur reality 
that can do it
that don’t even begin to make sense
howw?
wait what?
nice?
lessened chance of getting sick or smth
thats good
lucky
tears and smiles is way easier to work with than tears and self-loathing
ok good
to really just shit on their day
you can kill him off in the same moment and make it double painful
OR
and you can put a bit of a heartwarming touch on it
so when the characters are like holy shit you’re my dad they can laugh about how dumb they were for not seeing it
you want that bit of levity
its def good
its funny
yeah
sets up for a nice emotional payoff when they finally get reunited 
i like it
thats def a little darker
damn okay
oh right
like
by soldiers?
as in
shot
sick
?
the mom ghost
and im rly vibin with that isht
ok again you’re comin through with the shoulder cloak poncho things
deer people?
are they elves?
no
?
so long as you’re all having fun you’re doing it right
at least with bozos like me or my friends as your players
eh its not thaaaat hard
i think you should run dnd campaigns of your world
hmm
i think
ye i like the filing
truly an authentic wikipedia experience 
its even got all the ads
oh this is just a personalized wiki
or are ya salting the earth with the historical annals of war
gettin some real meat in that soil of yours?
oh like what?
i got into header making on my docs and its all pretty decently organized 
yea idk
holy carp man
or is it just copy pasting
das a lot
character making
tbh for me, my world building is much more like
i’ll def check out
but if i can use it for campaigns thats kinda hype
i was almost gonna pass cause my google doc is already too expansive 
oh hell yeah
like a boss
ninjad me
just answered that
o
what is it?
kinda reminds me of minecraft tho lol
never
its fantastic
is the whole thing the cat goin on this journey?
holy shit
is super cool
and then on top of that whatever is going on in the background on that video
sword's got a real nice bluesy thing going on
dam
o
lyrics are certainly punk af
than most metal bands
they’re more punkish
and hmm
for something good from knocked loose
im looking
ah
this one is very good
i'll definitely have to hear that
really
oh that's cool
this guy's nuts
im a huge fan of mastodon's drummer
especially in the instrumentals
it's definitely less hectic
yeah they're sick
damn this album cover is awesome
tho
gojira is quite heavy
here
that works too
maybe i'll make you a youtube playlist of some recs
ic
i don't remember, do you use spotify?
for sure
hell yeah
been listening to knocked loose and gojira
i never listened to them
hype
and mastodon
that's good, it's easier to have a main main character.
o
are you still using both mcs as mcs?
its a good design
magical smoke trails are always cool
nice
is that magic smoke or ghost particles?
and the wraithly mist stuff coming off her arm
i believe they are the gold standard when it comes to like high fantasy inclement weather chic
im pretty much always partial to ponchos
well
im a big fan of the poncho cloak
does he just like them or smth?
except quails?
and cute
that's awesome
quails
?
what have you been up to
Dam
o wait theres a website for it we're good!
lemme see if i can find it
dam i don't have itunes on my computer
about scarcity?
cool
oh ic
or has friends involved?
but she hears about it?
so the tournament arc thing isn't rly a huge focus for mc
nice
ah
how far into the story is this?
nice
cool
age
or like is he killed
of age?
gotta happen
pretty balanced rules
good king/queen's gotta have connections, tho, right?
yeah better than just picking your first asshole kid and saying "screw it"
oh, rightt now i remember, you did tell me this a while back
as far as i thought it was either that or all the great houses send their kids out to compete, but instead of actually letting it play out, they're really just trying to assassinate each other's children
i forgot then
hmm
or wait
not competition but exam\
well
it's a magic competition, right
truly the only correct way to choose a ruler
tournament arcs are necessary for any good story
yeah
just to show off
with built in waterfalls
Ondalare sounds cool
yup i totally see that
Woah
just gotta put the category headings in bold and you've got a rly good and well organized compendium of information on a place
hm
like
def
or just want to have all information available at all times
is a l o t
this
grrm just threw them in there and expected people not to notice lmao
sounds good
and of all horns, antlers are the best
horns are best
do they maybe act like magical antennae?
raeyi have horns, right? is there a reason for those?
sounds interesting
NO
they got horns right?
gotta go deep
nice
like the history?
cause, i'm learning rn, that dming a game in your world is def the most fun way to worldbuild
and do you think it is dnd campaignable?
what have you made?
oh?
as people who don't want to bone, but do have a vested interest in one another being alive after terrible things happen.
it's a set up for a much wider story in the long run, just introducing kisket and tracy and forming their relationship
And that's the not so basic premise
Kisket's off being taught about the interconnectivity of life, while the rest of the group is busy getting eaten by wild dogs and running out of fuel for their vehicles and realizing that their archeologist leader was lying about being in contact with the orbital base and they don't actually have an evac scheduled. and they're actually just completely fucked unless they find the artifacts they came there for. 
so she wanders off alone, guided by grass and trees and a few rodents
so it's all survival horror until suddenly, Kisket, deemed the least useful member of the group cant take it anymore and gorges herself on psychadelic fruit and realizes that the planet is talking to her and guiding her on a spiritual journey to find herself.
so they gotta choose who gets to eat, and that means that the least useful members of the team gotta deal.
and the team did not bring enough food for everyone
all would be fine, except all the flora and fauna on the planet is extremely hallucinogenic when consumed
now the first book is a much more focused story about two peeps, Tracy and Kisket, who travel with a team of archeologist/mercenaries to this planet that's covered in horrible sandstorms, but has a thriving ecosystem in underground caves. They're looking for alien artifacts, but as soon as they get underground, there's a cave in and they have to survive down there for about two weeks
i basically reworked the whole thing to a point where it's much better and feels like something i'd actually put out and be proud of, but it does make a lot of what i wrote now kinda obsolete
kinda sorta
sorta
and they're really clean
that's a lotta linage
OH akihiko did ff and nier cover art
fat chance for me
so like
moebius
my favorite artist rn is
yeah
mhm
like once in the beginning then once in the end
or more
visible lines are tough cause you kinda gotta go over em twice
that's a conundrum and a half
ah tru
so doing it rough and then just going from there is probably saving you effort in the long run
i mean the coloring is just gonna cover the linework in the end, right
makes sense
AH
OO
also those shadows
?
what's the green uh blob thing
woah, looks rly cool
oh cool!
what you been doing?
hows your art goin
OH
well ty
idk i kinda dropped off the face of the earth
*not saying anything about it
sorry for now
takes up all my time
that and playing dnd pretty much
working like all the time
i moved back to LA like beginning of last year and have just been
how u doin wassup?
shit yeah it's been a minute
hi
nice
oh now i see
can’t quite tell
what’d you change?
looks really good
looks rly good
i like the pants a ton
like if the sash at the waist is blowing in the wind the skirt should be too
in the final
also make sure everything moves in the same direction to the same forces
she just strikes me as the type
but i think you should add like pants or leggings beneath the skirt
i like
yea
this show is too good.
r i p
i just watched the most recent episode of slime
cause now he's respectable again
good he came out and said all that
i guess that's fair
that's hilarious
lmao
to the point where they just can't stop cause everything is out of control
yeah defenitely
that sounds good dude nice :)
cool
or does he come in contact with a particular time-warpy macguffin
so is he like a powerful magic user or something?
yeah solid
background omnipresent force of nature villains are the best ones
thats how you do it
ye
cause
i like to write religions with gods into my stories, but no acts of god or gods with influence 
understandable
like literally 
you could have the god be fate
ah
a god? or maybe two?
what did your multiverse begin with?
do you have an origin story for the origin’s origin?
that’s pretty nuts
so incredibly good
cause its sequel is
Alright have you read/heard of worm the webcomic?
n i c e
lol yeah i guess that's understandable
ah
why uncomfortable???
engineering is a good one then
ye
because then it makes Fulbrite into an enormous asshole
the second best in that case would be Fulbrite Science
 there ya go
it literally cannot get better
they’re building engines anyway 
yea.
engineering 
second 
good one
and u can do whatever you want 
its fantasy
since
thats not incorrectly spelled imo
&gt;.&gt;
so
fulbrite kerdlew exists
i’d say those were the best kind of names, but
wonderful 
coolio
ye figured
by making the c silent
you could fuk it right up
ohhh
so he’s rich as hell, then, right?
fulbrite did?
fair enough 
k e r d l e w
that is a great idea
l m a o
the newest page of k6bd is very good, if you haven't started i'd say now's a great time
nvm actually it's minor spoilers i won't send
wait before i send
OH
here's some
anyway
but it was awesome
i had work
didn't say that at the time cause
that pic is awesome btw
very sad
i did
and log horizon is awesome 
yeah it is pretty similar
yeah definitely 
good point 
oh
lmao
every episode is just: goblin slayer kills goblins in a different location 
i love it because it’s just a ton of money spent on what is essentially a shitpost
its funny, cause goblin slayer uses 3D, but only in scenes where literally nothing is happening 
awesome 
i need to get to this new episode 
also, slime show is amazing. 10/10
but its not bad
yep that sounds a bit sauron-y
sweet
oh shit
that's awesome
that one sounded like another dnd meme
really
very good
those were good
i watched perfect blue and tokyo godfathers the other day though
O I REALLY WANNA WATCH THAT
but there isnt anything out that makes me go
but that's just a dnd meme in anime form
im watching goblin slayer
not realllly
ummmm
uh oh
about a Crow who learned to speak to people
called Ka, Dar Oakley in the ruin of Ymr.
cause i just found the coolest folktale style book i’ve read so far
hey do you like folktale style fantasy?
and i've missed like 4
idk if i'll be able to make it saturday, since my dnd thing is every sat
that'd be cool
i'd be offended for your dad
that's a rough one
and now they got a new dlc and i don't want to play it to ruin my 100%
hollow knight is the only game i've ever gotten 100% on
oh woah i didn't see the one abotu the party
but i've heard of it
yep know the feel
3 hours of procrastination.
im jealous
thats
i know me and when i say it'll take me an hour and a half i really mean four hours
What did you find?
they're like lore posts
just want to let you know, reading k6, it's worth it to take the time to read the text posts under the pages
that's wild
personally i've read through k6bd so many times that
it's definitely more of a cartoony "anime" style
haven't seen that one
it's not a fair comparison
cause he chooses really good pov's
he does cityscapes the best that i've seen so far
he's rly good at coloring and shading
and the artstyle isn't like perfect or anything
it's got the best worldbuilding ever
cool
i c
as long as its not 3 pages of they fight
oh sweet
like uhh drawn on a tablet or smth?
is it computer animation?
That’s sweet dude
yikes
no, what’s that?
absolutely 
yeah
I like this a lot
Yes
Oh MAN i remember seeing this at first but totally forgot to read and reply im sorry
O crap forgot to send reply last night. I work like every Saturday night super late and i dont think i can call in sick for another couple weeks without it looking very suspicious :(
its just that the good guys aren’t the ones in power in this case
yea lmao
yea you could try
like polish it, or take it to a coder to see if they can decrypt anything from a computer chip
and you’d be able to do things with the loot to make them worth more
the plan is that there are several different auction houses, and you’d all go to separate ones to sell the loot you’ve got in your own inventories.
ye
im a little worried about that as well
same
its   b o r i n g   is what it is
it has the potential to get you in trouble tho
yea i like it a lot
itd also mean your party has less reason to hate you for blowing away some of their hard earned cash
ye
once its decrypted and translated and all that
access to info that you’re selling
instead you’d get like
my only caviat is that giving stuff to your resistance boys is gonna make you a lot less money
ye
and the companies are by no means good altruistic entities
sorta robin hood ish, if robin hood was working from the inside
it could work
wo skype auto response, chill
cool
What's going on?
note, this doesnt mean using things found on the internet on like homebrew websites
magic has everything from 5e, plus im willing to let people make up spells as long as they’re balanced and then wed spend some in-game time making it and like practicing it
or a side pistol just cause
like a barbarian might want something he can throw
basically im going with basic 5e classes but ranged combat will be pretty frequent so its pretty important to consider what you can do from range
ye
like 777,777 races leaves a lot of room for anything
and i like the idea of allowing anybody to make their own shit up
i already went and designed angels and devils as playable races
definitely 
ye
hell yeah
lol!
i do hope to get people invested into the plot with the ruins
very fair
so like
adult dragons will be around the size of a small moon tho
but like if you get sick of the ruin grinding i want to leave it open for you to do whatever, you wanna be a space pirate and rob ships and whatnot, i got a pirate hierarchy in the works. You wanna run around and fight dragons for no reason, you’ll probably die, but im not gonna stop you
lol understandable
2 cool for ruins
lmao
yea
its not hard at all
and
yeah i’ve already thought of ways to cameo my characters in here
oh sick
some races can’t use it, but most can
pretty prevalent
magic’ll be a thing
and also cause its broken
cause like, c’mon, we’re cultured
no machine guns, and nothing rapid fire
and good old fashioned swords
like you got flintlock laser pistols and stuff like that
ye
even a picture is enough to get the aesthetic tho
yes
fuck wjats that disney movie thats super good
like uhhh
like most space ships are just pirate ships with thrusters
aside the fact that it takes place in space its much more fantasy than it is sci-fi
but like uhh
YUP
yea my favorite like story idea has always been space archaeology, but with like horror elements thrown in
i forgot what i got
yea archaeology is the jam
That's awesome!
yeaaaaa me too
I’d probably have ya start as a new void runner team
this spawned a relatively new profession, called void runners, who are sponsored teams of people who go around raiding tombs and ruins and auctioning off the things they find. The sponsors getting paid by one company or another to gather teams that will give them priority in auctions and teams having their necessities funded until they begin to profit on their own.
and there are six super-companies that are driving a market for bounty hunter teams to go to these ruins and take anything of value from them.
but scattered around the universe there are ruins of ancient super advanced civilizations that may hold clues as to how to gain entrance to the tower
or at least nobody in known history
in the center of the universe the 777,777 gods built a tower that nobody so far has been able to climb
uhh
Angels act as like an eternal police force across the central galaxy, while devils make up the seedy underbellies of just about every major populated area, and the two factions sit at a strained peace where the angels aren’t willing to create the gigantic chaotic mess that would ensue from actively hunting down devils that aren’t doing anything overtly criminal, and the devils aren’t strong/influential enough to attack the angels unprovoked, especially since they’re all worried that another devil gang might stab them in the back if they did anything that would weaken themselves
The world is pretty religious as a whole, but more in a buddhist/shinto/hindu sense than a christian sense
but uh the universe has one primary god, that split itself in half in order create the gods Yis and Un who together proceeded to made everything. Un is called the white flame and he’s the god of light, purity, and all that is not.   Yis is the black flame and she’s the mother of shadows, want, and all that is. The only things that came from just one of them are angels, who are pieces of Un’s white flame, and devils who are remnants of Yis’s black flame.
i dropped some key points of k6’s world that were either too cool to steal or too crazy to use
its pretty nutty
The campaign is pretty heavily inspired by K6BD, with 777,777 planets that grew from the corpses of 777,777 gods that are home to 777,777 races of creatures that were designed in said god’s images
ANYWAY
stfu mars
really? thats sorta weird mars
im walking home from work so im bored enough to have a conversation with myself even
sounds good
well how about i tell you the worldbuilding stuff i made and you tell me if you’re interested 
i might
HMMMMMMM
like really badly
i’m in a similar situation, except i’m being distracted by wanting to run a dnd campaign
very understandable
yea thats a rly good idea
oh i c
whats this one about?
thats rough
OOF
that sucks, but is also great?
lmao
bery hard to keep interesting
that sounds
and i'm literally dying
i've been sick with like
seems planned
the scarf sorta matches the hair
n i c e
that's really
hoo, wow
laughably bad
fates was like
very fair
holy shit
than f a t e s????
w o r s e
wait wait wait
solid 3.5/10
not that he’s hot shit anyway
rip that guy
he could be anyone
exactly
not that marth isnt
but like the others are rly distinctive
feels rather bad
most people only know fire emblem from smash
l m a o
that's pretty awesome
that's awesome
that's incredible
so he'd literally one hit everyone
that's awesome
i mean, don't get me wrong, you can two unit the campaign a lot of ways
was the best time investment i've ever put into a videogame
i just can't get over my triple sorcerer team in awakening
tharja's at least got a personality
tharja's great too
now i think that's my most anticipated game
i don't have a wiiiiiii aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
so i can't speak for it
i haven't played radiant dawn tho &gt;.&gt;
with conquest's difficulty tho
i rly wish conquest and birthright hadn't like
but most fighters don't let you scurry across the ground like a mouse either
games don't address that
like, in real life, it's so much harder to walk diagonally back and left than it is to walk forward and right.
for instance, there's a turn radius, when you're not, so turning has weight to it, but that's not there in combat. you also move like a little bit faster along the ground, and can walk in a full 360 degrees without any difference in speed.
like it's actually profound how different the movement is when you're in combat from how it is not in combat
it's not a huge complaint, 
and ubisoft doesn't fix what isn't broken
if i didn't know they were gonna use origin's engine
i'd be so down for odyssey
that's freakin awesome
that's so dank
it's bad
so i'm like becoming super stuffy about that
which has the best combat animation system i've seen in so long
i've been playing absolver
if they just get combat animations a little more fluid and like, less choppy. more like people and less like video game characters, i'm so down
it makes me mad cause like japanese combat isn't stiff when you're moving.
the blocking is fair, though he could have his sword out a little further. cause if a sword would split his face open before it even touched his own sword the way he's standing. 
but it doesn't look like there are stances, just blocking and not blocking
or they're very far away
like the mc is taunting the enemies when he's doing that
i know it's common
it's the dumbest possible way to hold that sword
haven't seen that
i wouldn't ever see the light of day again.
but if i could have an open world action rpg with ghost in the shell's aesthetic, it'd be all over for me
it's definitely more blade runner 2049 than like
it's still pretty cool
i love cyberpunk's aesthetic
that sucks
:(((((((
: O
2077
yeah i probably can't do saturdays as well
i don't think that point would be possible to make without a reference point in freud
that they don't get it
isn't it important to reference material that you're arguing against if you're gonna argue anything?
that's kinda dumb
yea we really haven't used it
its awesome
 yea
n i c e
oh hell yea show me
me i'm just
oh, that's dope
ahh, sounds hard as hell
what are you going as?
o o f
i c
whats cosplay cramming?
nice!
makes people look gaunt and nasty like crack or smth
magic fueled by snorting copious amounts of crushed crystals
new story idea
 sounds like cocaine powered magic
powder mage
the gunpowder snorting one?
 damb, good times, tho
still good tho
but
streaky’s still better imo
death grips continues to drop tracks
btw
cause velocity:design:comfort is an excellent album
mine is death grips, Machine girl, and sweet trip
js
thats an awesome choice
that's
but like w/e
cause like why was i not here the whole time
and im half tilted, half ecstatic 
and just made more tips in one day than i did in a month at the old one
i got a new job
in other news
lamayo
sucks when you end up messing something up, because you automatically assume you messed it up
whoops i actually said that in the first message
tho
thats the best one tho
yeah
i getchya
in the correct sense
cause it’s horrible
like if i had to choose a favorite it’d have to be body horror
but it definitely had some influence on my like preferences at least in the horror genre
and those movies are awful
i watched the blade series when i was like 9 cause my dad thought that shit was hype
i mean
it totally fits
yea
one of my favorites
great at that
alien is
i dont think a horror movie is complete without one or two gross depictions of violence
i like a mix of both
i see
me i love the horror genre
but i have a hard time getting into like theoretical existential horror
idk what my favorite type is
about types of horror
issues
lol
i see
oof
if it doesnt serve a purpose then yeah thats an issue imo
true
yeye
shit
what are they called again?
uhh
not the lethani
like uhh everyone’s opinions on the lethani
i like casual racism when it fits into the context of the story
that sounds dope tho
like i can do like 3-5 pages then i have to put the book down and look at something else
Can you trade now
my problem was that i read frankenstien and it was a slogfest where nothing happened and from then on i just cant read anything that sounds remotely like mary shelly at the pace im used to
Can you trade now?
where the narrator is like leaving his last will or smth before unspeakable horrors descend on him?
yeah the whole fictional manuscript thing?
but the in thing was like
how odd
really?
i kinda respect it
which takes enormous balls
dont get me wrong, it works, but the dude’s basically jackin off his book within the pages of his own book
just know the monsters
i havent read lovecraft tbh
it was a little like... reading literary masturbation?
and detailing just how horrific and enthralling its contents were
spent a whole page describing the book as if it were an in-universe work of fiction
this whole book is odd
the intro is odd
the past hour
i’ve been sitting on the curb reading the king in yellow for
my phone’s on 13%, fyi. dont be surprised if i just randomly stop responding in a few mutes
whoseOh fuck
you’re literally writing history
 but even from a worldbuilding sense
i suppose
nor is sarah i think
i dont think
hamilton is not pushing it
but i’ve got people with names that are earth like
but i’ve got people with names that are earth lime
sorta, none of the story takes place on earth
yea
ive got lame on lock
so like
But one of my characters for my story is a direct descendant of henry wells
yea its pretty lame
i c
just that you could
im def not saying to do it
it’d be cheeky as hell
engle
the city of
or something lul
engle
like
it’d be confusing unless you made up a word and used it a bunch beforehand
francoise could be a feminine version of francon
and technically 
i suppose
unless you made english have a different meaning
very fair
ye a
de vro?
silent g
rog
*say
how do you way it? dev-ree-oh?
y e p
what’s that?
rest in peace dude on the left
not great enough apparently
"oh, of course! it's my old friend ryo! how the hell have you been keeping, then?"
i haven't seen the original devilman
that’s an awesome one
yep
like ron paul
i already did like a few republicans
gj
you did
well
okay we basically got all of those
it’s a hard one
black paint
new death grips single out today
didn’t quite fit
yeah
then if thats the case its all understandable 
oh
10/10
ive been trying to get this to work, to no avail so far
oh its been an hour :0
lol nw
it's
so in another 30 minutes or so while i wait for a bunch of shit to compress, i'll have made a mod for Dragon's Dogma, of all game
it's a japanese competitive event
was "dude youre fast" one of those attempts?
that's cool
they're more like indigo
well they're still blue
that's stupid
i think i like reiq's better now too
yea
by having a rly interesting cover
sell copies
or like
embellish upon my writing
i primarily like to use art to like
yeah
i like my art with a large amount of incoherency involved
i still prefer #2
yikes
oh
im just assuming compositional balance
nice
if she’d balanced it it’d look dumb
the second piece is entirely about its sense of motion
you’re kidding
and only me
replace judges with just me
no style
bad judges
the girl’s
i perfer #2 i think
i love it
its basically a speed painting competition 
???
what
they're so good
yeaaaa
my fingers 2 fat
w h o o p s
definitely 
to flesh them out
use side characters tho
and yea i think thats a good idea too
oh this is awesome
:0
thats a rly good one
these r rly good
yea
that's great
what's that?
i'll check it out when i have time
like devilman? :D
that shit's thicc
it's better?
i don't know space battleship yamato
:O
that's him
he's freakin out
(bhangra) 
"i'll fuck you and you'll fuck me."
because he's saying
(talk) 
(ttm) 
(morningafter) 
(puke) 
i don't like emojis and stuff
nobody can ever figure out any book's message tho
rather than being written for it's story
it sounds like a book that was actually written for it's message
i guess that's alright
it's just all a really close shade of color to hp lovecraft
cause technically it's colorful
that said, i don't really like the invented manuscript style very much
and that's not good
it doesn't like
that i'd like 
it's definitely a cool theory
reminds me of ursula k leguin's galaxy
with an infinite universe it's basically impossible that we're the only life in it
and i believe in ufo's just cause like probability and shit
like "well everything they teach you in school is bullshit anyway, i mean the earth is flat so..."
i didn't know what to do in that conversation
and now he's a flat-earther so like
that's basically what i mean by grounded
honestly i don't know why exactly it would hurt, but that's my inner sociopath speaking
and to see me get like c's and d's cause i felt like school was bullshit probably hurt for her
last night before they're due?
cause school isn't actually about learning things
cause apparently it doesn't matter if you know what they're teaching you
and that's really all you need
&gt;.&gt;
couldn't pay attention to the book cause the class was too loud
that's awesome
that's awesome
i definitely get a lot of moments where i say "wait wtf," and have to go back and reread 2-5 pages
oh it wasn't fast
but i feel like there's a little too much going on in brandon sanderson's writing/worldbuilding
cause i just couldn't stop
but i can't read it in one setting
like it's good
that's the problem im having with way of kings
that's the good feeling when you can suddenly
that's good
well that's good
you've got 10,000 years of history all plotted?
but your tech isn't based on magic
but that game and that game's lore are two seperate entities
but that's not magitek, that's just
i don't actually know of a magitek thing that's not inspired by final fantasy
that's awesome
well it won't matter too much
it's way too easy to get carried away
this one took me like 3-4 days &gt;.&gt;
if i could like physically write without taking some character's perspective 
Hansa Madhavaditya has few memories of his childhood, but they all begin after a short, yet vivid one of him being lead by one of the masters, down the long corridors of the monastery where he grew up. His small hand, gripped gently by the well worn and wrinkled ones of Master Parvat Sikhar Thand. His robes, a miniature replicate of the ones worn by the elderly man next to him, scratched along the cold stone floors. Everything in the monastery was cold when he was young, from the floors to the walls to the clay pots and pans, just moments after coming out of the firepits for the evening meals. The temple lay beneath the peak of the Pryat Naahn, where the cold will prickle your skin even through the thickest clothing. Yet despite the cold, Hansa remembers those halls filled with the echoes of soft music and the warm smiles of masters and students as they passed. The cold didn't touch those people. Hansa remembers those times fondly. Hansa was 12 years old when Master Thand died, with his passing a quiet fell over the monastery. The walls grew colder. The lamps burned duller. The halls and corridors lost their former luster. No longer could one hear the echoing of laughter around every corner, or the chimes of bells left in open windows for the wind to ring. The music hall was left empty, for there was work to be done. In Hansa's case, his studies and training overtook much of his free time. The masters pushed the young students into physical training, which meant combat.In all his years at the monastery, Hansa felt as if he were always a step behind the other children. He learned to read and write, late. He could never paint well, had trouble reading maps, always burned himself lighting candles. The only activity he found any true comfort in was music, but even that was taken away with the death of Master Thand. But when it came to combat, Hansa shined above all others. Hansa found that fighting and music were not all that dissimilar, and in practice bouts with the other children, Hansa danced to the beat of a deadly drum. Despite all this, Hansa was dismayed to find that his teachers didn't seem to appreciate Hansa's newfound martial prowess. "Agressive," they called him. "Belligerent, brutish, and hostile," they said in their reports to the masters. They believed Hansa exhibited traits unbecoming of a servant of the Daughter. He was reprimanded for his aggressive ways, and was separated from the other children, until he could learn to respect and love all his fellow beings.After two months of separation, Hansa came to an understanding while reading through the Scrolls of the Exalts for the third time. The issue was not with his skill in combat, but his eagerness to perform it. He was always the first to jump into the sparring ring, and the first to strike in any match. Any true disciple of the Daughter and surely any true hero worth counting among the Exalts, knows that a balance must be held between their duties and their desires. Hansa has been given a duty by the Daughter, to respect the world and its inhabitants, to be a beacon of peace, warmth, and hope for all to see. And if he cannot temper his desire to sing songs of violence, then he is undeserving of the title of White Chain. With his head bowed, he told his teachers thus, and they smiled.In the years that followed, Hansa completed his formal training with the other children, and earned the white chain he wears around his neck. At the Chain ceremony, Hansa and his peers were each given a scroll containing instructions for when they so choose to descend the mountain and look outward to the world for the next step of their training. And so Hansa packed his meager possessions, and made his way down the mountain.\
cause that's the best way to do such things
i've got my boy hansa's copied
this character isn't my norm and is anti-edge
that'll be cool though
cool i'll try and check it out sometime
where's it at?
rly bogged down in it's stupid systems
that's nice,
oh it's a just a tabletop campaign
oh that's cool
what'd you find?
oh that's nice
i kinda know what you're doing
those riffs are awesome tho
lol
that's the only way i can imagine playing that
that's dificult
he's dragging his fingers along half the strings
tbh i've never been a fan of like theme rock or theme metal
this one's good
that's fuckin nutty
i've loved hearing sweedish in my rock music for some reason
i'll listen to em all
very apparent what phase they're going through
i'd start with the seer
i honstly wouldn't start with that album
they don't remind me of thank you scientists
that's way better than these bools
idk, i don't like too much metal that isn't prog metal or grindcore
i'd heard of them
at the heart of Rides' soul
at the heart of Ride's soul
that's the grip
that's good form
i bet it's easy to get like
cause that sounds like it'd make your hands like
that ones spooky as heck
oh shit
that one's dope too
and i didn't think that was possible
it's like
i can't believe i haven't seen this before.
that's fucking cool
that's kinda cool
it's a gm-less dnd game?
im glad he doesn't do like lets plays or anything, cause his comedy doesn't work like that
but he's got good ones
dunkey's videos have gone down in quality
dunkey's videos
so if they like something you know it's good
but egoraptor's animations
if only this was real . _ .
which one's post time skip?
that's
it's not a great show
i didn't see the a there
yeeeeaaaaaah that's the best one
fingers too fat
type on mt phonw
cant
*lmao
definitely lmap
 yeah i can see that
i see
yea agreed
“i fight for my friends”
i k e
nvm
so at that point he doesn’t qualify
serious brain damage from poisioning
green goblin was an infp up until he got like
oh ok nw
a nice dude at heart
but gg is like
maybe
the green goblin
you know an infp villain?
holy shit
ye
yea
as long as your not an idealist making an ideal main character
i mean
ye
my main villain is an istp like me
 like
you dont want to write about an mc that you cant identify with on some level
yea that makes a lot of sense tho
thats pretty cool
i just found out that bruce lee and myamoto muzashi are istp’s?
wait
ye
understandable
thats coo
i just know mine
thats fuckin cool
cause i dont know all the intricacies 
have you done the tests for them or do u know the typings?
its pretty cool actually
if you look really hard i’ll bet a lot of them are just different amalgamations of you
i had the same thing with most of my characters lol
*do
i should dp that
lmao
yea definitely 
tello be like a nickname in that case
 and you could have
the tongue movements for daln are def more awkward than for teln
&gt;.&gt;
it's hard
whichever one you think you'll be more interested in in the long run
is when uhh, one of my character's Simon, is like mind controlled and forced to interrogate and kill his former boss, that he had a crush on. by sexually harassing him to death.
feels horrible
oh. everyone just straight murdered
that's long
that's like
that's a good one
especially when they're done right yeah
yeah if he's like recovering in a medical ward of the school
yeah that'll be nice
like if she's worried about freaking out and killing people
since you're drawing the art you don't have to worry about it being misinterpreted
well if anything that's a good thing
it can't be too similar
as long as the villain's motivation isn't to like
since he's gotta like
so he gimps other people's ability to take him on their terms
that's a very strong stat
what's that for, like uhh
he's a smart boi tho
he's not that great at magic
if everyone's overpowered, nobody is
i was worried that she'd be head and shoulders above everyone else
that's
those aren't actual sentences &gt;.&gt;
they're like
i like that one a lot
Randall Talbon
o yeah :P
i've been pronouncing it dahln
no worries lmao
but this is all awesome
gotta wake up early tomorrow :(
but anyway im gonna go to bed
hard to give context to em
they’re place names
lol
that's nutty
im sure it'll be successful
sarah's that cool?
sarah is nethe's friend
and they treat her like she's a walking timebomb
or you could easily have people be afraid of her because she's got so much power
well there's that optio
that'll do it
you could, you know, blow up someone's wrist watch to cut their hand off
so you've got big armored trains and stuff, right?
yeah that's a little op
now that's cool
oh shit, if you're trying to survive like a blast from catapult could you meld your armor into like a piece of wall or mountain?
especially if you're already wearing armo
that'll sting
i mean it wouldn't kill you, but a metal shirt with no padding
that'd still sorta hurt though
so you can't like
what's it about
no u haven't
or else it's like
i think its super important to have magic that's useful outside of combat
like where people aren't moving and there's just a bunch of talking
and it's not like because fight scenes are better, but because the exposition scenes are
the story itself is so good it doesn't matter
i'm caught up in the anime, so i just started from there
it's
that's awesome
yeah that's the best
that's cool!
yea theres a lot of information needed there, but this is like after the first arc of the story anyway, right?
i see
cool, what is it?
thats friggin awesome
here by far
haven't had the chance to watch grancrest yet
oh cool, i like that
oh nice
theres a little too much videogame world type fantasy anime these days
nice thats pretty alright
but nothing caught my eye. having a hard enough time keeping up with ancient magus bride tbh
yeah, super fun. What’s good though? i’ve looked at like the covers for some of the shows
no i haven't been watching anything
ye nw
there, check it out whenever you want. im really just unsure if i differentiated the characters enough
a link to this google doc of it
u mind if i send you
hey so
ok
school settings need a tooooon of characters
in this current story
and if you already have some characters you like
absolutely
yeah
yeah its awesome
as does tribal art
the homunculi and chimeras from fma have great aesthetic
n o i c e
the restrictions on them will be pretty cool tho
but they just remind me of the grimm from rwby
like the particulars are wayyy different
oh no
but aside from that it's great
the grimm
the shadow beings remind me of rwby
just gonna be frank
hwoah
just at some point
may not be today
if possible i'd like to send you my super duuuper rough prologue/intro thing
if you want sure
that's awesome
lol what happened?
oh thats solid
but you've got a start tho!
oh gosh
cause i fell way behind
2600 a day
i've gotta write like
nice
maximize availabke storage space
well thats even better stacking
OH
what an eggcelent stacking job too
lmao
genius
the third one im thinking is gonna be pretty reserved and does a lot of thought monologues maybe even have a running internal dialogue.
rn i’ve got one person who’s very descriptive of the environment, spatial details and such. One who focuses most of their attention on other people and will mostly describe objects and stuff only when people are affecting them or when they are affecting people.
i like switching perspectives. I’ve got 3 MC’s that i switch between and im gonna be trying to go for like 3 completely different styles of narration based on who’s perspective the story is being told from.
yeah
keep things from getting too monologuey
oh that’ll be cool
perfect
that is
lmao
the hardest of hardcore rp servers
thats awesome
oh
just a direct hit to the emotional receptors boom goes the death star.
that shit hits the feels a little too hard
no
but like
maybe a hopeless nerd looking for a cute e-girl girlfriend.
definitely
who’s goal is to make money
better than my man tracy
thats solid
nice
nah all they need is a goal, a flaw and a distinct voice
yeah making people feel real is hard
yeah all you need are some mildly interesting people to write your story about
and the premise itself already nails any reasons your characters might need to stay invested in the story too
cool
i see
about alien bones that give audio-visual hallucinations
im thinking of not giving my characters any agency in determining the plot. but my whole thing changed from a sci-fi adventure to a horror suspense story
yeah thats a good way of keeping things natural
thats awesome
definitely lol
yeah i like this idea a lot
yeah
they erase evidence so there isnt an uproar and so their families dont take players out against their will
and its not like the company can’t believe that they’re doing the people that are trapped a favor
definitely
yeah
i see
theres also the part where shutting down the game is like ending all these people’s lives
the moral dilemma that comes from having the mc have to decide wether forcing all the people out of the game is also very solid
its a really good idea, the problem is that you’d be hard pressed to make the corporation not come off as like blatantly evil 
i blanked on everythimg until just now
holy crap
yeah i get off at like 12:30
im on break at work tho and only have like 1 minute left and cant say anything else D:
those are all rly interesting
but its not
as far as forums go it borders on boring
nothing
no arguments yet
i still havent seen a swear word
ive yet to read a single instance of flaming
they're crazy
yea kinda lol
ive been like hardcore lurking all over the nanowrimo forums
hoos it going?
thank yuo
ye it works
i figured out a good enough name with that method, thanks!
i've been at work, sorry for takin so long to answer
whats up?
im pretty sure i was a fifteen year old homestuck fangirl like a couple years ago
nice
oh awesome
was at work
im not quite home yet
sure
naw thats awesome
thats a great idea
shit
Oohhh
cool
oh?
ur right
yeah lmao
well
her art style is perfect for that horror mystery genre
lol yeah
ssss is wayyy better imo
but ive been reading minna since a red tail's dream
i had just watched donny darko at the time
lol
i could maybe do a character from my story but that feels pretentious as hell
:(
yeah ofc lol
depends on how you make the whole mechanics of the world work
maybe maybe not
idk
ic
cause he returns to his normal life right?
*beginning of the end
like somewhere around the middle or the end
i'd have him meet another person who'd trapped themselves in before him
if thats the case
awesome
nice!
steer clear of melodrama entirely
and i dont mean like
as long as you dont get too melodramatic it'll be awesome
thats a really fresh take on the whole idea
I like it
cause i havent had any other story ideas for 3 years
im just gonna go with what i've got
ok
you're doing it
i'll try it tho
thats pretty crazy
&gt;_____&gt;
it gives you a month
oh i forgot
but maybe i should
i never have
idk
that'd be cool
john and jane's dad still doesn't have a name
its funny
yeah thats fair
lol
i've seen every single omae wa mo shinderu meme
thats wild
thats a longtime hussie fan
oh wow
*killer
yeah that sounds like a mood killet
oh man
 a lot of homestuck jokes came from problem sleuth too
its a very solid story, much shorter
ic
the characters of homestuck put problem sleuths in the dirt
just from a story perspective
problem sleuth&gt;homestuck
tbh
ye
people piles?
that patchy peach fuzz
yeah 
ah understandable
:(
the beard is mia as heck there
man
nice
that'd be really funny
that shits hilarious
maid dave
sailor girl dirk
i love all the outfits that dave and dirk cosplayers can pull off
lmao nice
she didnt even have a face
i meant cool
w t f
ic*cool
snowman was so cute
even clubs deuce?
impractical &gt;.&gt;
that sounds
diamonds droog in his many forms was probably my favorite character in the comic
about the midnight crew
i totally forgot
ACTUALLY WAIT
ahh ic
he's worse than:(
jake is literally the worst character
thats fair
well
homestuck did have some good parts i guess
that's awesome
lol
all praise the batterwitch if that's your thing i guess
ahhh
oh man
jane?
thats cool
lol yea
"... i dont think this is gonna work"
"you dont like my patron troll?!?"
i wonder how that conversation would have gone down if you didn't
oh man
cause i hated terezi up until after cascade
made me lowkey upset when i cared about patron trolls
which
mine is terezi
thats awesome
wtf
wow
and vriska
aradia nepeta
equius
ooh
she did have a lot of personality that's true
cause she was literally an exposition bot
except aranea i guess
those guys were pretty much all solid
i also liked all of the alpha trolls
yea
yeah karkat is one of the better homestuck characters
f u c k   g r e y   f a c e   p a i n t
helll yea
nicee
that said i did have like a 3 year spanning two man homestuck roleplay skype chat
i think?
since i didnt
they never ended up going crazy over it
so like
i was lucky enough to be the guy who introduced homestuck to my friends
yeah i feel you there
i mean
ur friends clearly had suboptimal shipping tastes
bleh
fuk that
better than karezi
katnep is cute tho
but after roxy became a thing
2 years beforehand
that said i was a hardcore john/vriska fan for like
john/roxy otp
yeah
except for roxy
we didnt need the universe B kids
it would have been great
if it had ended at cascade
YEAH
but the fandom was kind of cancer
i was gonna say unlucky for missing out on the massive fandom
actually nvm
or unlucky?
oh lucky her
i mean obviously went through the whole thing
it was too long of a wait
i sort pf lost interest in homestuck after the second megapause
but idk
that'd be cool
oh really?
idk if im gonna play hiveswap
its partnered with viz? that's crazy
yeah i heard about hivestuck
yeah!
holy mother of god
wow
that dude is hilarious
oh i saw that part

He came down from the mountains to find the sacred maguffin of ancient power and return it to his people so they can conquer the world once again. He also has all the powers and can fly turn invisible, breathe fire, ice, or lightning, and he can’t ever die.

The grandfather clock struck noon. The gentle 'bong-bong-bong' rang through the modest red house on the left of Adelaide Street, Australia, and then faded into silence once more.

Everything was calm. Everything was quiet. Until….

[Commission 72: The Devil you Know, COMPLETE!]
Three minutes in he falls asleep.
Tracy pulls his phone out of his pocket, connects it to his translator, and looks up one of the movies Tobin had texted him about last week.
thanks, shanta.
yeah.
Tracy nods.
Tracy doesn't respond.
and i was the one who bought the shitty ship that we nearly all died on.
since i was the one who proposed we add palum to the team
i feel like a good part of all this shit happening is my fault.
sorry about all this.
um.
Tracy nods.
fucking too happy.
Tracy lets out a breath.
The object disappears from the radar.
The com line cuts.
"Bye."
Tracy nods and waves back.
"Alright, I'll be off then. See you around?" Veruvi smiles and waves.
"Man, thats... Tough to hear, but thanks!"
"... Oh."
"... Oh."
he left early. i think cause you weren't there. he used to come by, to see if you'd come back, but then he stopped.
he's alright, i think.
he came, yeah.
"How was he doing? I can't really check on him, since he's at Monad and I'm uh. Not really able to get through to them right now."
"Actually I wanted to ask. Did Mars come to that party?"
"If you guys are good, then I guess I'll... Go? Wait!"
"Well...."
"Ummmm..."
Veruvi rubs her forehead with her palm.
Veruvi rubs her forehead with her palm.
"Yeah...."
"...Except for the other day... And, uh.... The past couple months."
Veruvi frowns.
"I'm never too busy for you guys!"
"Oh!" Veruvi looks away from the camera. "That's nice of you, but really it's no big deal!"
i think. uh. we'd be good.
maybe 45 or 50 minutes.
an hour? a little less actually.
I d9n't think I can take y9u all the way t9 Zenith9n... 6ut I can g9 s9rta cl9se!
Luckily, I can make this th9ugh! H9w can I help y9u guys? Need a lift? 9r maybe an escort 9r s9mething?
I g9t Tracy's invitati9n t9 y9ur party f9r Iri. I was s9 glad she's 6ack, 6ut I c9uldn't make it.
I'm g99d! I'm great! Actually.
It's uh... 6een a little while...
Hey! I saw y9ur distress signal!
It's Veruvi.
"9h. Shit." The figure takes their helmet off.
They're wearing full black armor, and are sitting in a deep red leather chair. It looks pretty comfy.
A figure appears, their image transposed over the window. 
Tracy accepts the request.
this one's a communications request.
engines are still heating...
Another alert pings on the window display.
wow it's really fucking big.
it's fucking big.
something just exited hyperspace near us.
Tracy checks it.
In another thirty minutes, the ships dashboard pings an alert.
Voraj slinks back into the walls.
"You penisular nasal globule."
"Alright, fine. I'll fuck off."
"Cockshnoz. Heh."
"Cocknozzle."
"No problem cocknose."
Cypress nods, as if he completely understands what Voracious is saying here.
"And three filths. Only one of which is a pistil."
"Three arm gobs."
"Three."
"You know how many filths there are on Zenithon? I can count it on my arm gobs."
"You'll give me early onset spore deficiency. And I haven't even gotten a chance to procreate all that much."
"A GUY CAN ONLY CUM IN THE WALLS SO MUCH, PLEASE. STOP."
"A GUY CAN ONLY CUM IN THE WALLS SO MUCH, PLEASE. STOP."
"HOLY EXCRIMENT HOLE." Voracious shouts.
"He definitely helped a bit." Eao says.
Eao nods.
he was pretty helpful.
so that he knows that he was helpful?
i don't know.
me neither.
...
Then everyone sits around because there's nothing to do while the ship can't  move except wait.
In 10 minutes they join everyone else.
Everyone heads up to the bridge or their respective rooms while Tracy and Eao go fix the reserve power.
Tracy nods.
holy fucking shit!
holy shit!
Palum yelps, then teleports away.
She stabs Palum in the gut with the spear.
Everyone looks up.
What does Iri do?
Her sword is drawn and she's ready to party.
Iri immediately spots Palum dropping from a dart left in the ceiling.
Kisket sighs.
Kisket hugs back.
Shanta is in the doorway, alone.
But suddenly, the door opens.
They start to head to the door.
we should head back upstairs.
yeah.
He fails.
Tracy tries to hold back a groan.
"It was the worst thing I've ever experienced, and I used to be a janitor in the sewers on Veilus."
"It was the worst thing I've ever experienced, and I used to be a janitor in the sewers on Veilus."
"It was terrible."
Eao grabs Tracy's leg and rubs her face against it.
you alright?
He heads over to Eao.
a-alright.
Tracy blinks, then frowns.
uh.
Tracy offers to help Voraj up.
voraj, you okay?
Kisket blinks, still staring at the door.
Holy shit.
And she said, 'Thank you.'
And she said, 'Thank you.'
That was the first time I'd actually told Qitara I loved her.
She hugs Iri back.
Kisket is staring at the door.
are you guys okay?
[Combat finished!]
The door opens for them and closes behind them.
Facing everyone and pulling Qitara along with her, Palum backs out of the room.
"Your friends are back." Palum says. "I'm leaving now."
"GODS! SIX HUNDRED GODS!" Eao kisses the floor twice.
"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!" Eao shouts.
Eao is shunted out of the sword next to her a moment later.
Voraj is on the floor in the pool room, four feet away from Palum, who is tightly gripping Qitara's hand.
Then suddenly everything goes dark.
Everything is quiet.
Eao falls onto her back.
"Placid Valley!"
Her eyes grow wide.
Eao says. "-------------------------------- Placid Valley?"
She sits down.
Then she stops.
She throws her arms into the air and starts to stomp around, stopping for moments to point or glare at Voraj.
Eao catches up with Voraj.
"Placid Valley," he says to no one at all.
The person looks at her for a bit. Then he looks back at the water.
"------------------" He says.
"-------- Placid Valley." He says.
"­­-------" He says.
The person looks up from the water, then notices Voraj.
Eao starts weaving to and fro as she makes her way to Voraj.
So unremarkable that she can't seem to recognize it as a face.
Its the sort of face that isn't remarkable in any way shape or form.
The person doesn't quite have a face. Well he does, but it's not one that she could distinguish from any other face.
He's wearing a bright blue jump suit. and has a fighter jet helmet on his head.
The person is looking at the water. 
She passes Eao who sort of shakes her arms and jumps, and reaches the person.
Eao heads down the hill toward the person.
The windmill is turning.
To her left, there's a small forest. To her right, there's a grassy plain, and behind her is a wheat field and a tall white windmill.
Eao starts heading down the hill.
Eao motions for Voraj to follow her.
"There's a lot of people down there."
Actually, Voraj is certain it's only one person.
Or a lot of people, neither Eao nor Voraj can really tell.
Down the hill, there's a lake. By the lake there's a person.
Eao stands, wobbles, then rights herself. 
Or her clothes, or her fingers.
Eao realizes she can't feel the grass she's sitting on.
Voraj can't hear Eao.
"What the fuck?" Eao says.
Eao watches Voraj's mouth move, but can't hear any words.
Eao sits up and looks over at Voraj.
There is no wind. There are no sounds.
A massive mountain range surrounds them on all sides. The sky is overcast, and it sheds an even grey light on everything.
A massive mountain range surrounds them on all sides. The sky is overcast, and it sheds an even grey light on everything.
They're lying in the grass under an oak tree atop a small hill.
Slowly, Voraj and Eao come to consciousness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
She taps on her sword with her fingertips.
"Good." Palum says.
Palum nods.
"Don't worry about me. I can handle myself. If anything I'll be the one worrying about you." Qitara smiles. She pulls her hand out of Kisket's and walks over to Palum.
"Let go, Kisket. It's fine. I'm fine with it." Qitara says.
"Let go, Kisket. It's fine. I'm fine with it." Qitara says.
Qitara shakes her head.
Kisket holds onto Qitara's hand.
Please don't.
Qitara.
Tracy is pissed.
Kisket is frothing at the mouth.
"Okay, but if anyone attempts to stop you from coming with me. I will kill them. That includes your alien lover."
"That simple?" Palum sighs.
"I'll go!" Qitara shouts. "But first you have to let those two go."
Qitara frowns.
Don't go, Qitara. Please.
Did you hear anything that psycho said? She's clearly not the same person you described to us.
Fuck her.
Fuck that.
Fuck.
"I'll go." Qitara nods. "If it will stop this."
[Team turn!]
Palum tosses a dart into the air.
Palum tosses a dart into the air.
"Now. Lay down your weapons and give Qitara to me, and you'll be spared the fates of those two."
Palum turns to face Raros and Kisket.
She is instantly sucked into the sword.
Eao dodges into the cut and it slices her arm to the bone.
Eao rolls a [20/8] to resist.
Palum rolls a [4/14] to cut Eao.
Palum disappears and reappears at the dart by Eao.
[Enemy Turn!]
Palium blocks the shot with her sword.
Palum rolls a [3/13] to resist.
Kisket rolls a [6/10] to shoot Palum. Qitara doesn't stop her.
Kisket rolls a [6/10] to shoot Palum. Qitara doesn't stop her.
Eao gets up and pulls the dart out of her foot.
Palum grimaces.
The shot pierces her shoulder.
Palum rolls a [17/13] to resist.
Tracy rolls a [10/13] to shoot Palum with the entrobounce. 
Palum rolls a [2/13] to resist the shot.
Palum rolls an [11/15] to resist the bite.
She coughs.
Palum places her hand on the spear.
The spear impales Palum's ribcage.
Palum rolls an [18/13] to resist.
What the fuck is that?
[Team turn!]
wOAH!
Voraj is immediately sucked into the sword.
Voraj is immediately sucked into the sword.
Voraj gets lightly scratched across the scales by the sword, just enough to break the skin.
The dart catches Eao in the foot and she trips.
Eao rolls a [20/8] to resist.
Palum rolls a [4/17] to throw a dart at Eao and an [8/14] to scratch Voraj with the sword.
[Enemy turn!]
"Don't!" Qitara shouts.
Kisket tries to shoot, but Qitara grabs her gun and pulls it away.
She pushes Qui off her before Qui can bite, and drops beneath Tracy's shot.
Palum gets caught in the neck by Voraj. She yelps.
Palum rolls a [16/15] to resist Voraj's bite, a [6/15] to resist Qui's bite and a [6/13] to resist Tracy's shot.
Tracy rolls a [12/13] to shoot Palum with pyrokinesis.
"I've been waiting to fuck someone up all day!" Eao shouts.
Eao slaps her fist in her hand and runs at Palum.
She tilts her head out of the way of the bullet.
Palum rolls a [1/13] to resist. 
The spear teleports to Palum before she can fully dodge and slices her across the chest.
Palum rolls a [6/13] to resist.
Palum rolls a [6/13] to resist.
[Team turn!]
Palum doesn't move, and continues to point her sword at Raros.
[Enemy turn!]
[Combat Start]
Qitara doesn't respond.
"are all your friends this edgy?" He whispers.
Tracy leans over toward Qitara.
jesus fucking christ.
"Come, face me and die." Palum points the sword at Raros.
Palum holds out her hand and a long sword that looks as if it were made of dozens of long shards of glass appears in it.
"But you are my obstacles, and I am Palum of the Placid Valley. No obstacles that stand before me stay standing long."
"That'd be nice for you, wouldn't it."
"Are you making threats?"
Palum blinks.
She doesn't respond.
Qitara frowns.
"He said you'd understand that."
Palum shakes her head. "I do not fully understand why. He told me to tell you, if you ask, that the Wolves have invoked hunt law, and it's time for us to make good on old promises."
"Why did Palanhin order you to bring me home?"
"Qitara wasn't in any of the cameras.... How did you get here?"
"Is that Qitara behind you?"
fuck you.
hey.
She shakes her head. "You idiots."
"You found and broke my camera, but you didn't leave the room?" Palum says.
Palum steps through the door.
"It'd probably be easier if-" The door to the hallway opens.
"It'd probably be easier if-" The door to the hallway opens.
"We need to tread carefully. Palum is very dangerous."
"Yes." Qitara says.
And me. I guess. But we didn't let her into the room.
Palum is coming to kill all of you.
so. mind telling us why you fell through the ceiling?
wow we should have wet tee-shirt contests more often.
wow we should have wet tee-shirt contests more often.
Fuck you Tracy.
Kisket groans.
Qitara and Kisket climb out of the pool.
Eao does the same.
Tracy whirls around, hands raised.
The team begins to follow, but they hear a loud splash behind them.
Tracy starts heading to the door.
alright lets go.
---------------------------------------------------
She grabs kisket's hand and drops through the floor. 
Qitara lets out a breath. "Okay. Thank you."
Fuck.
Static.
We need to get in contact with Raros and Tracy.
"Right. Sorry," She says.
"I-" Qitara frowns. 
Cypress is sweating profusely.
Cypress looks back and forth between Shanta and Qitara.
"UH....."
"Uh."
"Cypress open the door." Qitara says.
A few seconds pass without a reply.
"And why would he not simply tell me?"
"Wait!" Qitara says. "Why would Palanhin order that?"
"Which means I am forced to eliminate all of them." Palum says. "I apologize. I'll have to hurt you, just this once, but you'll see."
"Whatever cost. And all these people in this ship are making very very large obstacles of themselves." 
"What?" Qitara says.
"So I was honored to recieve this mission from Palanhin. I am to bring you home at whatever cost." 
"Then I thought about it. And I realized that there's no way. It's impossible for you to be happy there. With these aliens, in their disgusting alien home."
"For a while I thought I was wrong to be so upset. You look happy after all, but..."
"But." She sounds as if she's about to cry. "But when I saw you yesterday, Qitara, It was so painful. I can't stand it." 
"I want..." Palum starts softly. "Qitara to be happy."
Qitara frowns very hard.
Something scrapes against the door to the floor.
The pounding slows then stops.
"Open it!"
"Open it!"
"Open it!"
"Open it!"
She pounds more. "Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!"
Cypress starts sweating.
"Open the door!"
Palum pounds on the door again.
“A year since you disgusting hedons stole my Qitara from me. My Qitara! My sweet sister, my darling orchid. I won’t have it! I won’t! I will not! I’ll take her back even if I must cut her free from your writhing, grasping hands. And I’ll wash her of your filth and cloak her in Eir’s finest silks. Qitara is mine! My Celebrant! And she will be celebrated by me and only me. I should carve out your wretched eyes for even daring to look upon her, but I won’t. I will spare you just so long as you open this fucking door and deliver Qitara to me.”
"It's been a year." Palum says.
"It's been a year." Palum says.
He puts his wall back against the door.
He puts his wall back against the door.
"Uh." Cypress pulls back. "Okay."
"What?"
Cypress with his hands on the door, stops.
Cypress nods.
"Probably."
"She's rather dangerous."
"Palum didn't need to do that. So she chose the art of combat."
"I told you we each choose arts to study, in our free time, right? I studied  the arts of celebrancy under Palanhin, in order to prepare myself for the honor when Palanhin passed." Qitara starts.
Qitara frowns, then whispers, "Palum... How do I say this? She has a strong temper, at times."
Palum hits the door with her fist.
"Thieves! Open it!"
"Open the door." Palum says again.
He shrugs.
Cypress looks at Shanta.
"Open it." Palum says. "I only wish to talk."
Qitara frowns and looks at the door.
She looks at Qitara.
Kisket frowns.
"Please open the door."
"But it's for your own good, Qitara."
"It makes me upset, to be the one to do this." It's Palum.
"What's the password?" Cypress says.
There's a knock on the door.
There's a knock on the door.
"Hopefully it will reach Yon Oryx soon and we can figure out exactly what's going on."
"Okay, I just finished sending out a distress signal." Qitara says.
That'll be good.
Do you think they're gonna look for whatever's jamming the radios?
Kisket frowns.
"Room secured, boss."
He puts his wall up against the closed door and extends it.
Cypress closes the door.
Raros points at Cypress. "Sure will," he says. Then he and the rest of his squad head to the elevator.
----------------------------------------------------
They head to the door.
alright lets go.
first get him a towel though.
"Cause it'd be hot."
what? why?
"Tracy you should crush a camera with your bare hand."
"That's pretty hot."
"You did?" Eao sizes Raros up.
"Find anything, Raros?" Eao aks.
He bends a few of the vent bars shoving his hand in there, but he sticks it through fine.
He bends a few of the vent bars shoving his hand in there, but he sticks it through fine.
Raros checks the walls for anything unusual and finds a camera in a vent.
Raros checks the walls for anything unusual and finds a camera in a vent.
hey deafio, lemme help you out.
Tracy heads to the pool.
Everything else seems untouched at first glance.
what the fuck?
Inside, the first thing they see is Deafio, asleep on an inflatable lounge chair in the center of the pool.
The doors open as they approach.
They head to the doors.
pool first.
They hop off at the second floor.
They slide down the elevator shaft.
There are a bunch of boxes, several of them empty.
There are a bunch of boxes, several of them empty.
They look like they're filled with sheets, towels and toilet paper.
we never checked the pool, the docking bay, or any of the storage rooms.
so we skipped a few rooms on our first check of the ship.
They head back out.
The password is stupid.
Cypress nods. "Don't forget the password."
Cypress nods. "Don't forget the password."
...Okay...
yeah.
Voracious is on the ship?
"Are you absolutely sure this is Palum's doing?" Qitara asks.
"Are you absolutely sure this is Palum's doing?" Qitara asks.
"This is all very unlike her." Qitara frowns.
Kisket nods.
we won't be able to move for another hour and a half or so though.
The ship's lights turn on.
we've got regular backup power running, but we're pretty sure palum is trying to sabotage the reserve power right now.
Weird.
Kisket frowns.
How would they just break? You didn't give them all to Tracy did you?
How would they just break? You didn't give them all to Tracy did you?
"We were very concerned..." Qitara adds.
Why haven't you been picking up your radios?
"Got kind of boring waiting for one of you to work up the balls to say the password." Cypress yawns.
Tracy heads over to the console and turns on the lights and air recyclers.
Tracy heads over to the console and turns on the lights and air recyclers.
They head inside.
Cypress opens the door.
"Close enough."
hey!
we're wasting time, c'mon raros, just say it.
yeah.
for emergencies.
"Why do you have ribs stashed in that fridge in your room?" Eao asks.
i have my ribs stashed in a fridge in my room.
you don't have ten racks of ribs on you.
i'll grill a rack of ribs for you if you nominate raros.
im voting raros.
Tracy whispers back. "'wall is the best and i really really want to join.'"
say the password.
Eao looks at Mal.
me? i'm not fucking saying that shit.
"You're not getting in unless you say it."
"You guys figure out the password yet?"
"You guys figure out the password yet?"
It's 'Wall is the best and I really really want to join.'
It's 'Wall is the best and I really really want to join.'
Kisket is rubbing her face in her chair.
"Nope. Not unless they get the password right."
"That's not the password."
Cypress coughs.
"Bro, tha- I mean."
"What's the password?" Cypress says again.
"That sounds like something someone I can't trust would say, fucker."
what the fuck cypress?!
...
"I came up with it. In order to make sure nobody gets in who I can't trust."
"There's a password."
there wasn't a password
what the fuck?
are you guys alright in there?
are you guys alright in there?
Cypress replies. "What's the password?"
hey!
He knocks on the door.
Tracy heads over to the bridge.
Nothing has changed, except the door to the bridge is shut.
They climb onto the third floor.
They climb up through the shaft.
Tracy doesn't say anything.
The door falls down into the shaft.
Eao kicks the door open.
don't kick it.
okay, pull open the door lightly.
that door leads into the elevator and we can climb up the third floor from in there.
shit.
i think we just passed the exit.
wait.
They head down it a bit, and pass by an exit that leads into the elevator shaft.
They're in a service tunnel, there are wires and pipes along the walls, but nothing is out of the ordinary.
They head inside.
Tracy unlocks the grate, and pulls it open.
holy shit dude let me unlock it.
Raros rattles the grate really hard, but it's holding it's ground.
thanks, iri.
thanks, iri.
oh holy shit.
They drop through the grated floor.
They drop through the grated floor.
aw shit!
He stumbles a good three feet back and drops his keys.
Tracy rolls a [15/13] to resist.
He rolls a [14/13] to shove Raros off the grate.
He slams into Raros with his shoulder.
Tracy pulls his keys out of his pocket and runs at Raros.
you fucking asshole, what are you doing?
stop!
woah woah!
Raros grabs the bars of the grate. He begins to tug on the bars. Violently.
It looks like it can open.
There's a handle on the grate.
and nobody's fuckin punching through my walls.
there's a grate in the wall.
alright.
Tracy nods.
they aren't answering their radio.
we should probably go check on them.
sick. in an hour or two we should be back at full power.
He turns on the engine there.
Tracy climbs up the ladder to the second floor.
Tracy climbs up the ladder to the second floor.
alright.
on anything else?
yo iri, were there any more of those disks?
Iri hears an alarm beeping in the vents that lead toward the front of the ship.
She breaks it.
Tracy frowns.
Iri breaks two of the three on the other side.
... motherfucker.
if you can hear me turn on all the lights.
if you can hear me turn on all the lights.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
can you hear me?
hey shanta?
Tracy calls Shanta again.
There are three more on the other side of the engine.
She breaks the last one.
She breaks two of the three.
They're not part of the engine.
it's working.
oh shit!
The bottom engine turns on, and the generator fires up.
Iri, teleports to the second floor and notices three on either side of the engine there.
He heads back to the computer to continue hitting the button to reset the auxiliary power.
shit i hope you didn't break anything.
Tracy rubs his hand over them.
Nothing changes.
She breaks them both.
quit stabbing at my ship!
wOaH!
Tracy heads over to look at them.
huh?
There are two, placed near the floor.
Voraj notices a couple black disks on the engine.
Nothing changes.
Iri stabs the third one and it breaks, then does the same to the fourth.
She tries to pull one off, but it's stuck.
Eao looks at the others.
"Woah, violent." Eao nods. "Nice."
Iri jams the spear into it and breaks it.
"Did you find anything up here?"
"Damn, I wish I had your powers." Eao says.
Raros, Eao, and a little later Mal, all reach the third floor.
She feels really hot all of a sudden.
Iri gets shocked hard.
Iri sinks her knife into the disk. and she feels it break something inside.
Iri firmly stabs one of the disks. It cracks a bit, the outside seems like plastic.
They're placed sloppily near to the floor, and they shock her when she touches them.
There are four flat black disks on either side of the generator, and she can't pull them off.
Looking around while the others climb, Iri notices pretty quickly that something's off.
Eao climbs the other ladder.
The only light sources for Eao and Raros are the emergency lights along the ladders, and the computer.
tracy continues to fuck with the computer.
and Voraj, can you check the engines for anything weird on them? little black boxes or anything?
why don't you guys check the generators? they're above the engines on the third floor.
he continues to mess with it.
uh...
Tracy frowns.
"No retard, under the floor. It's either under the dining room, or the kitchen, or the pool."
Tracy heads over to the terminal and tries to mess with it.
alright.
"Alright, so the new skank fucked with the engines, but the backup power station is between floors one and two. I think she has to touch the shit to fuck it up, but I could be wrong." Voracious says.
"Alright, so the new skank fucked with the engines, but the backup power station is between floors one and two. I think she has to touch the shit to fuck it up, but I could be wrong." Voracious says.
There's a computer terminal in the back of the room, on the left side of the engine.
There's a computer terminal in the back of the room, on the left side of the engine.
The engines are on the first and second floors, but she can't quite make out what's on the third floor. There's a pair of ladders on the left and right sides of the room.
Probably because exterior damage could cause them to explode.
They don't have any exterior damage.
Mal checks out the engines.
Voraj isn't really paying attention.
There's a loud clunk; the floor shudders when the door hits it.
Everyone else gets inside and the door drops behind them.
"Get the fuck in here right now." Eao says through her teeth.
The four of them lift up the door. It's very fucking heavy.
Eao rolls a [5/11] to open the door.
It's a little too tough for Tracy and Raros, too, but with Tracy Raros and Iri, it starts to slowly grind upward.
Tracy tries to lift it up, but it's too heavy.
Tracy rolls a 15/13 to open the door.
Voracious squeezes back into the wall.
Eao follows after Iri.
Tracy heads over to the engine room.
lets go try to turn on the power.
yeah now it sounds patronizing too.
that sounded disingenuous.
...
we checked the machinery in there, and nothing seems broken.
"Yep." Voracious says.
tight as dick?
"These fucking panels are tight as dick. I had to leave a couple of my internals in a gob inside the wall."
Voracious spills out between the wall panels.
"Fucking no." Voracious says.
"Did he fix the respawner?"
Eao follows Tracy out.
Tracy pushes past Qui out of the room.
Tracy pushes past Qui out of the room.
he's down here?
yeah, i forgot he took one of the storage rooms, shit.
co-owner.
he
wh- voracious?
Tracy falls in a heap.
aH!
"You slapped me in the face you dick!" There's a thump.
oh shit! sorry.
"Ow, fucker!" Eao shouts.
what??
"Get those two idiots the fuck out of the other respawner for me, I need a second to oxidize." Voracious says.
"And we needed to build a new quarters for them, so Damascus planted the gardens you see now."
"Holy shit you have a fucking brain between those massive ears of yours?"
"I'm in the hallway!" Voracious whispers.
Voracious doesn't respond.
"Good."
"And when you're finished killing her you're gonna go kill her some more. Until she's so fucking dead that she doesn't look like a person anymore."
"You're gonna kill the shit out of her, okay? For fucking up my ship."
"I can't tell where she is cause the fucking air vents and the gravity generators make so much damn noise. It's all out of wack."
"Real rancid that one is." Voracious says. "I almost like her."
Voracious mimics Palum: "And of all things, for you to come home, only for that wretched whore to be hanging off your shoulders, giggling like a pig... I'll gut her. Gut her and kill her and gut her and kill her. Harlot. Slut. Heathen."
"She's talking right now."
"She's talking right now.
"Here let me try to copy it."
"Really ugly voice that bug bitch has."
"Did you know she talks to herself?"
"She fucked this thing and the other one, then she ran down to fuck the engines."
"I don't fucking know. I can see in the dark about as well as you can." I was waiting for one of you fuckwits to come here so I could tell you what I knew."
"I don't fucking know. I can see in the dark about as well as you can." I was waiting for one of you fuckwits to come here so I could tell you what I knew.
"She was fucking it with her grubby touch pads. All over. Then it started sizzling and it was too hot to melt into. Started fucking evaporating me. I had to go into the kitchen and dissolve some carbohydrates."
"She was fucking it with her grubby touch pads. All over. Then it started sizzling and it was too hot to melt into. Started fucking evaporating me. I had to go into the kitchen and dissolve some carbohydrates.
"I watched her do it."
"That new recruit of yours fucked all this shit up."
"Uh, uh, uh." Voracious coughs. "Fuck it stinks like burnt metal in here."
"Lick my hairy slime trail. And my raucous taintwads."
"I leave my room all the time. You idiots just don't know."
"Fuck you."
"You didn't remember me you cocksucker."
"Holy shit do you have a fucking brain between those massive ears of yours?"
He can sort of remember the voice. Someone from the base once? He's only heard it once or twice.
"Raros tell her who I am."
"You don't fucking remember me? You piece a' shit."
"Keep quiet."
"Shut the fuck up stupid lizard!" The voice whispers.
Raros can't exactly place it.
"C'mere. Wall."
"Pssssssssssst!"
"Psssst."
"Psst."
Voraj can't see anybody inside, and the respawners aren't making their usual respawnery hum.
"Watch out, dumbass."
Tracy bumps into Eao's shoulder and they both whisper, "Ooh! Shit!"
There's nobody in there save for Tracy and Eao.
It's dark.
"Thank you." Qitara says. "We just have to be prepared for when the power comes back, so we can send a distress call."
"Oh, man, sorry sir-I mean, Shanta, shit.."
"Oh, man, sorry sir I mean, Shanta, shit.."
"Huh?" Cypress says.
His arm is now very obviously around, but slightly above Shanta's shoulders.
His arm is now very obviously around Shanta's shoulders.
"Always the first to try and fix things when they go wrong." Qitara nods.
"I'm certain she's somewhere trying to resolve the problem herself." Qitara continues. "She's always been like that."
Kisket doesn't respond.
"I've known Palum for all my life, there's no way she'd put us in danger like that."
"Why would you say that?" Qitara frowns.
"What?"
[Commission 72: The Devil You Know]
lets see if we can't get the respawners up and running.
Voraj headbutts the elevator door and it rips open, sending her flying out into the hallway.
Voraj headbutts the elevator door and it rips open, sending her sprawling out into the hallway.
Eao rolls a [10/16] to use push on the elevator's emergency hatch.
i really can't see shit.
"Naw. That shit was locked."
"There's no power."
it's a fucking emergency hatch you just pull the handle.
There's no power.
why'd you do that?
Eao rolls a 10/16 to use push on the elevator's emergency hatch.
There's a short drop to the roof of the elevator and a longer one to the base of the shaft.
there's a short drop to the roof of the elevator and a longer one to the base of the shaft.
"Me too!" Eao shouts into Tracy's mic.
i'll come down, raros.
"We need to find Palum and make sure she's alright!"
Kisket doesn't respond right away.
Palum isn't in the room, so far as they can tell.
The room is bare, Palum didn't really take much stuff with her.
"Oh!" Kisket shouts over the radio.
the ship's emergency monitors are up, it's saying we're running on backup backup auxillary power.
"hey raros," Tracy says over the radio.
And just like that it's gone.
There's a plate of leftover steak in the open fridge.
A half eaten bowl of macaroni under the table suggests that Deafio may have been here recently.
There's macaroni piled in the sink, and the fridge door is hanging open, but other than that, nothing's out of the ordinary.
Voraj leads the way into the kitchen.
he's not in the kitchen?
we're up in the bridge.
Iri yanks Mal's door open.
Mal's door is still locked.
It's a little heavy.
There's a bit of scratching coming from a door down the hall.
Iri can't see shit.
The doors to the kitchen and dining rooms are open, since they aren't automated.
Iri kicks Raros' side of the door and it slams open.
Iri kicks Raros' side of the door and is slams open.
A bit moreso on Iri's side than on Raros's.
But they're safe.
"The elevator cable is a rope, though." Cypress nods. "Why not use that?"
"The first?" He says, "No, the second. You could jump down to it and probably not die." 
There's rope in the hangar.
Cypress turns to Raros. "The elevators don't have any power."
"Wait."
Cypress opens Eao's room, then turns to Raros and nods.
doesn't he sleep in your closet?
"Is everything alright? We were locked inside our room."
He heads across the hall to Shanta's room.
Cypress finishes opening Kisket and Qitara's room.
so we're getting everyone together in the bridge, just to be safe, you know?
backup power's out too. so i don't think the respawners are still working.
power's out all over the ship.
"Hey man." Cypress says.
we're getting everyone out first.
Cypress, get iri's room?
i don't fucking know.
i got cypress up and we're opening up everyone's rooms.
Tracy looks at Raros from behind Cypress's massive girth.
"All the doors are stuck. I think something happened with the power."
"I pulled your door open for you." Cypress nods.
"Hey man."
Door's stuck.
Cause the door won't open.
Except he doesn't.
He's still a little groggy.
He can't really make out anything.
He's in his room on the ship.
"This is the view I wanted to show you."
"Out here."
They climb the steps and head into the tower. Inside there's a long spiral staircase that leads to a small windowed room. There's a grated brazier in the center and qitara uses a lever near the bottom to ignite it. 
"Lets hurry on up."
"Lets hurry on up."\
"We're nearly at the lighthouse, though. Just up these steps and up that tower."
"We're nearly at the lighthouse, though. Just up these steps and up that tower.
"Haha, I'm getting a little too sentimental. This place tends to do that too me."
"We used to be friends, sort of. But it was a long time ago." Qitara says.
"We used to be friends, sort of. But it was a long time ago."
"And that's why he's being held in that cell in space."
"He didn't want to, of course. He was forced to do it by the god inside his body. But that didn't really matter."
"And Dredgen slit his throat under that tree over there."
"Damascus was the old Ur Celebrant."
"He killed Damascus. Well Yor did. Through him."
"We don't tend to talk about him much. Anymore. It's a bit of a taboo subject actually." Qitara shrugs.
"I was the one who used to care for him after the induction ceremonies, since back then, I was training to be a celebrant myself."
"And we needed to build new quarters for them, so Damascus planted the gardens here."
"Six years ago, there wasn't anything up here. Then we found Dredgen Yor at our doorstep."
"Six years ago, there wasn't anything up here. Then we found Dredgen Yor at our doorstep.
"Normally, there'd be students studying or training up here, but... It's a little late for that today.
"This time of year is my favorite, since the Chessa trees are just beginning to bloom." Qitara says.
"This time of year is my favorite, since the Chessa trees are just beginning to bloom."
He sets it in front of Deafio. It's cold.
Tracy throws the saliva covered mac and cheese at the sink.
Tracy shoves his hand into deafio's mouth.
Tracy, unsure of what to do, starts grabbing loads of paper towels.
He pulls deafio's head out of the bowl.
He pulls deafio's head out of the bowl
what's wrong?!
fuck's sake...
They wait two minutes.
There's a shitload of mac and cheese inside.
we've got a ton of that.
because one i'll fucking shoot you, and two you're not voraj.
but you're not going to do that.
isn't he like... your dad or something?
ship's safe.
we're on watch. making sure the ship is safe.
"I'LL FUCKING FIGHT ALL OF YOU!" Eao raises her fists.
His stomach is the same as it's always been.
Deafio's stomach grumbles.
"Alright, lets continue onward."
Qitara nods. "Well if you finish in time, meet us at the towers, we'll head there last."
"I would love to... But... I need to finish preparing. There are still things I need to pack, and then the sending ceremony begins soon... There is still a lot to do."
"Ah, so much has happened that I want to tell you about, Palum, but I'm currently giving a tour of the temple to my friends. Would you like to join us?" 
"A wonderful pleasure to meet you all." Palum bows her head.
I'm Kisket.
I'm Kisket
"It is good to see you too Qitara." Palum says. "Care to introduce me to your friends."
Qitara twists palum back and forth in the hug for a little over five seconds. Then lets her go. "It's been far, far too long since I've gotten a chance to do that!" Qitara beams.
Kisket follows Qitara in she offers a wave to Palum.
Palum smiles, warm. "Hello, sister." She pushes herself off the bed gives Qitara a hug.
A gold shelled girl, a little shorter than Qitara is sitting cross legged on one of two simple beds. The empty bed has lavender sheets, while Palum's has grey ones.
A gold shelled girl, a little shorter than Qitara is sitting cross legged on one of two simple beds. The empty bed has lavender sheets, while Palum's has grey ones.
She heads inside, arms wide shouting, "Palum!"
A voice offers a small, "Come in."
"The door has been left open, I think Palum may be inside." 
"This room belongs to Palum and I. It has been ours ever since we were tiny children, just beginning to form our stripes!"
"So Eirs and Xols only do field work." Qitara nods.
"No, no. Jaren makes sure nobody does rites and ceremonies but his Ur children. He's a bit aggressive about it."
Qitara comes to a stop in front of a door that's been left slightly ajar.
"In the time between contracts we study, train, do temple chores, and pursue mastery of an art."
"As is, we recieve either too many or too few contracts to expend so many resources on each one. So we'll have an Ur preform the rituals and either an Eir or a Xol research and execute."
"Or at least that's how it would work in an ideal world."
"Urs preform the proper rituals, rites, and ceremonies, and Xols execute assassinations."
"Eirs primarily scout and do field research on targets."
"She was the first Eir, and the founder of the Children of Oryx. Which is why Palanhin holds all of us Eirs to the highest standards possible." 
"The auditorium is named Mormu's Wisdom, in honor of... um. Mormu!" Qitara blushes a bit.
"These are the Eir Quarters. Palum and I had our rooms here, and we took lessons in the auditorium down the hall."
"These are the Eir Quarters. Palum and I had our rooms here, and we took lessons in the auditorium down the hall.
A couple hours pass. The ship lands and Palanhin greets them. Tracy Eao and Cypress stay behind with the ship and the Temple denizens while the rest of the team follows Qitara on her tour.
Qitara claps, "Excellent!"
"Qui is a beautiful name! Alright, would you two like to come? Or would you rather stay... I'm sure there will be lots of feasting in the halls. That might be more to your liking."
"Qui is a beautiful name! Alright, would you two like to come? Or would you rather stay... I'm sure there will be lots of feasting in the halls. that might be more to your liking."
"Mal-qui, what would you prefer to be called? I suppose I never thought to ask you."
"Voraj and Malenquious-uh, Mal... Um... Qui?"
Cypress and Eao don't even answer.
Tracy shrugs. "I think I'm good. I'll stay on the ship."
"Raros, Iri?" Qitara turns to them.
Tracy shrugs. I think I'm good. I'll stay on the ship.
"I never got the chance to show you around!" Qitara's eyes shoot open. "This time I'll definitely do so. Would you like to come?"
"Much like they did when you first brought me with you."
"You know Shanta, they're going to make us stay the night."
"This is rather exciting." Qitara smiles. "It's been a while since I've been home."
and voracious'
i didn't want to do it, but i didn't have a choice.
or else he wouldn't chip in the extra twelve hundred credits to make the purchase, you know?
or else he wouldn't chip in the extra twelve hundred credits to make the purchase, you know/
He sets a course for the temple's dock. Docking permissions and coordinates were sent after the comms closed. 
"Okay," Sholas's voice beams, "we'll see you shortly!"
"Why don't you guys come dock at the temple? It should be much easier than a ground landing in the desert."
"Let me alert Palanhin! He's been waiting for you!"
"Tracy? Of Team Shanta, Correct? Hello! This is Operator Sholus Eir of the Temple of Oryx!"
Tracy rubs his face.
i didn't. choose the name.
"THAT'S OFFENSIVE!" Cypress grinds his armpit into Eao's face a little more.
"GET OFF! GET OFF! YOU SMELL LIKE HORSE ASS!"
"HEY! It's not my fault you guys interrupted my morning sesh with this landing stuff!"
"GET OFF YOU FUCKIGN ORANGUTANG TIT BITCH!" Eao sputters.
"PFHT" Eao coughs. "FUCK! AGH!"
He grinds his armpit into Eao's face. 
Cypress tries to stand, but he's having troubles.
"I am okay." Qitara says.
fuck i hope i didn't screw up the landing gear or something...
You don't have a license to fly this thing?
i don't have a license for ships larger than twenty meters long!
i've never landed this thing on a planet before!
There's a heavy thud as the ship drops like a stone into the sand.
Shanta notices a soundless glowing ping in the lower left hand corner of the ship's head's-up display.
Kisket enters the bridge, she's the last one in as the ship begins its descent. They found a clear space to land about a half-mile out from Qitara's temple.
Kisket bends over and looks at Shanta, "Here's the booty," she says, proffering her but like a common wench.
"Do you wanna make out?" Eao frowns a bit. "I mean. I do."
"Wanna make out?"
"It's real pretty."
"Damn. From up here you wouldn't even know that Yon's a barren boiling hot shithole."
little less than i'd thought.
"And?"
i coulda warned you that wouldn't have turned out well. but i sorta wanted to see how long you would last.
"I love you right now."
"Make me some as well?"
"Tracy you're making coffee?"
It's Eao's voice.
"Oh six hundred gods, I smell coffee."
Tracy isn't really listening to it.
There isn't too much.
"I had much... much too much to drink."
"Thanks... Seriously..."
and one of them is from a girl named uh palum? don't really remember her, but qitara saw me reading hers, and said this girl's her best friend or something.
i've still been getting applications from people who want to join our group.
but right, shit that's not what i came over here to talk about.
well that's... cypress' fault...
i'm doing awesome. you were right a ship is way better.
Tracy explains so to Penryscroponi.
He gets a couple weird looks, but at this point it's not out of the ordinary.
"Okay..."
She can't seem to figure out how to respond.
"Oh... Oh no. You poor thing, what happened?!"
Porcea's heart stops for a moment.
"It's Porcea, remember?"
"ARE YOU SAYING," she shakes him some more. "YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME??"
"YOU LITTLE ASSHOLE!"
"DEA-WHAt??"
"DEAFIO!!" she's crying
Porcea shoves her hand in Liz's face to shut her up, pushes out of her chair and speedwalks over to Deafio.
He's not currently seated, but there's a mountain of mac and cheese in a massive bowl just sitting there.
He's not currently sitting there, but there's a mountain of mac and cheese in a massive bowl just sitting there.
Cypress's seat is closest to the door.
No, it's still there.
Oh my god what the fuck?
Qitara looks back. "I'll be right back, then," she smiles.
"Are there any requests you'd like to put in with the chefs? Voracious hired 'only the best for the Wells,' his words."
Qitara bows her head back, "Of course, Iri. It was either this or the cheese and mac that those chefs are constantly preparing. Cypress tried some in the kitchen and asked for a 'a kilo' of it."
Qitara bows her head back, "Of course, Iri. It was either this or the cheese and mac. that those chefs are constantly preparing. Cypress tried some in the kitchen and asked for a 'a kilo' of it."
Qitara bows her head back, "Of course, Iri." It was either this or the cheese and mac. that those chefs are constantly preparing. Cypress tried some in the kitchen and asked for a 'a kilo' of it.
"This was the last one, I saved it for you both." Qitara smiles.
He starts to make his way to the exit as inconspicuously as possible.
I'm glad Iri's back, that's awesome, but like, I've only met her once or twice, and all...
I think if it's not a problem, I think I'm gonna go, then.
Mars doesn't notice the glances.
she's uh, working with some different bounty hunters now...
What she's up to?
Do you know where she's at?
yeah i don't know what happened.
i invited veruvi, you know, and she'd even said she wanted to come, but uhh.
yo. what's up brother?
Mars is looking around at a bunch of people that he doesn't know.
Cypress is wearing a "kiss the cook" apron. He hasn't cooked anything.
yeah that was it, i'll sit back down.
Two faces in particular though, are missing. Uti's and Veruvi's.
Two faces in particular, though are missing. Uti's and Veruvi's.
Everyone's gathered around a long dining table on Tracy's Yacht Ship.
i'll admit. i sorta doubted you had it in you, but shit you really pulled through man. you're fucking awesome. 
this one's for pringle
oh yeah of course tracy's gonna make a fuckin toast, yeah tracy shut the fuck up.
yeah i know what you're thinking.
well i can't decide between buying a yacht or a ship.
Well I can't decide between buying a yacht or a ship.
He smiles. "we missed you too."
Tracy's wrist snaps.
Tracy's foot scrapes off a shin guard and Tracy twists his ankle.
Tracy rolls a [20/13].
Tracy kicks at Oroumczek's legs.
Tracy rolls a [9/13] to resist Krayna's ass.
Tracy rolls a [15/13] to resist.
Tracy presses his hands against Oroumczek's side and rolls an [11/11] to use chain lightning.
Tracy rolls a [9] for Oxium and hops the fence.
Kisket's arm hits a fire escape. She does two backflips and lands on her back on a garbage container.
Kisket's arm  hits a fire escape. She does two backflips, and lands on her back on a garbage container.
shan, cmon.
The fist makes contact and tracy's head flies back and slams into the ground. 
Tracy's arm bends, but doesn't take any real damage.
He jumps off and rolls a [9/10] for the flying falcon punch.
i'm gonna fuck this guy up!
Then he pockets it.
im so glad that little shit didn't ask for a raise.
you heard all that, dude?
frafra's wraps. for any big bug people with lots of arms. maybe scaria i don't know.
shut the fuck up i'll fire you.
the mission we're on. 
yo john, what's up.
i'll call him.
that's the best i could give ya.
i don't know. the dude didn't describe it very well.
"that guy knew absolutely nothing holy crap, lol" Tracy sends as another pm.
[Tracy rolls a 1 for Charisma.]
"Tracy rolls a 1 for Charisma."
"time to leave?"
"time to leave?
what'd he look like?
alright, what'd you see?
so the stowaway. what'd you see?
and we don't got a lotta time.
johnny, man. we've got a lot to talk about.
alright, we'll head back to talk to johnny.
s' nothin!
i'll buy.
what're those, polya?
I don't know what else to ask. Shanta?
Actually nevermind.
That'd be cool.
It's been a little while.
Yeah, how are you doing?
She's great.
She's great.
It's great.
But aside from the fact that she talks about it every single day.
And she doesn't know whether or not she wants to, or if she can even say no.
she's great.
it's great.
and she doesn't know whether or not she wants to, or if she can even say no.
She doesn't really know when she's going to need to return to her home.
She's been really worried the past few weeks.
It's, good.
Sure.
We'll go talk to Karcin.
polya we'll go see the guy?
i said i'll go talk to the fucker
i don't care.
i'll do that shit.
that's why you wanted bounty hunters for a shipping manifest discrepancy.
that's why you wanted bounty hunters for a shipping manifest discrepancy
korrar wouldn't send you anything but the best, yknow?
we're fuckin awesome.
you've got nice parents dude.
He can't decide if it's good or not.
Kisket, it's nice to meet you.
i'm tracy.
i've always loved some good sabba.
actually i'm his husband.
Whelp that's where he got it from.
Tacy's just taking everything in.
I didn't do anything.
Kisket's eyebrows raise a bit.
you're one to fuckin talk
I'm gonna keep reading this book, kay?
Especially when it's long.
Well. Yeah, but it's not like clumps.
You don't like tug on your hair when you're stressed?
Yeah, on the devotchka mission like nearly a year ago.
Didn't we fight her once?
She doesn't say anything.
Who said words couldn't hurt...
I'll do it.
If it's not a dream. And it's real. You've got like, family. Your brother, our team, Polya, Voraj.
But lets say it wasn't a dream.
I mean, it's a dream.
Okay I'll go.
Kisket rolls a [6/16] for resistance.
Kisket rolls a [3/14] for detection.
Reassured, Kisket swims to the hole.
Don't like.
I'll do that then.
... Yeah, It's weird, I uh... I know.
I'll like, help you breathe... Uh. Mouth to mouth style?
I've got a weird idea.
Okay. That's.
There's a hole down there.
Kisket grabs Shanta's hand and leads her to the hole.
Kisket rolls a [5/15] for detection.
Kisket rolls a [15/14].
I'll come.
But if we've gotta do something. I guess we can go over to those bubbles.
I don't know.
Hey, wait, don't your feet hurt?
I'm done now.
That's a little better.
Don't look for a sec.
&gt;Yeah. Good job. That's a good little Kazchke.&lt;
&gt;And now I'm gonna save you, little guy. Aren't I amazing?&lt;
&gt;But here I am.&lt;
&gt;Crazy, right! Kate said Neon, don't be ridiculous. There's no way you're gonna crash a Monad operation and kill the guy they're trying to assassinate before they get to assassinate him.&lt; 
&gt;I really did it!&lt;
&gt;I did.&lt;
&gt;You wanna know who killed Kaiden Trazch?&lt;
&gt;Hey there cutie, you awake?&lt;
He' looks to the side and sees a pair of boots.
"Fuck!"
He can't seem to stay awake.
"Im gonna fucking kill you, you fuck."
"Im gonna fucking kill you."
Simon wraps his tiny hands around Mars' neck.
"Fucking cunt."
"You fucking bastard..."
He knew it was coming, he'd heard the order. But he wasn't supposed to see it.
"AAAH!"
The holes in his shoulders, chest, and gut burn.
I don't wanna die.
"Sorry. I talk when I'm nervous."
"And flying cars."
"Holy fuck I hate heights."
"Haha, awesome, real convenient."
"Oh look, there's the ship."
"Don't fuck with dads and their daughters, I'm tellin you."
"Don't fuck with dads and their daughters, I'm tellin you.
"Scary shit."
"You know?"
"You know?
"Ara's dad's got Chromatin."
"Like back where I'm from, dad's had rifles, and you had to be worried about them doming you from their porch when you tried to go through the front gate, but."
"And then even worse her dad's the fuckin president."
"Cause I bet Ara would like... Kill me a hundred times if I fucked her then stood her up."
"I'd have to go Kill Distan, Marry Jan, and Fuck Ara, but even then that's tough."
"I mean I fuckin bet she's good."
"Wow."
"Kill fuck marry, Jannessen, Distan-ino, Ara-Chro."
"Okay, dudes." Lzi looks in the rear view mirror.
"Wow."
Lzi blinks.
"Lzi blinks."
"Cool." Lzi nods.
"Uh.... Anybody... Have anything they like to do, when they're suspended fifteen hundred feet in the air with nowhere to go and are in major need of a good distraction?" Lzi asks.
"Cool."
"Wonderful. A ship is on it's way, try to hold tight."
"I take it Kaiden is dead, then?" Zacht asks.
"These taxis can't fly in space."
"Uti, call Zacht and get him to send us a cargo ship or something we can land this in."
"Lets get the fuck out of here."
"O-okay. Job done."
"What the fuck?!"
Kaiden's ship is hit by a falling skyscraper.
"Uh. Actually never mind."
"Jinx."
"Jesus fucking christ man."
"Jesus fucking christ man.
A red beam cascades from the ship to the planet's surface, cutting straight through the Precipice's shields and decimating the ground beneath the ship.
"Hello, citizens. My name is Lady Wolf. I am hereby enacting the Laws of the Hunt upon this city. This decision pains us all, but it must be done. Please, live your last moments in joy, knowing that you have contributed to the grandest cause any being might achieve. We thank you for your understanding."
In the window, there's a masked face with slots for three eyes, with straight black hair that frames it.
There's a masked face with slots for three eyes, with straight black hair that frames it.
There's a projected window in front of it.
It's Her Feeble Wings.
Kaiden's ship is about thirty floors below.
"Get in! Kaiden's ship just took off, we gotta follow it."
"Holy shit! I just saw all of that!"
Small Boy stomps twice and the doors close.
Small Boy rolls a [3/5] to shoot Uti.
Small Boy rolls a [3/5] to shoot Aradia. 
Small Boy rolls a [3/5] to shoot Mars.
It's Small Boy.
He high fives Uti.
"SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT! AAAAAAH!" 
"AAAAAAAAH!!!!!"
The hands reach up and wrap around Simon's torso and shoulders.
"IDRETH HELP! FUCKING HELP!"
"HOLY FUCKING SHIT"
"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!!?!"
A portal opens up around Simon's leg.
"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!" Simon shouts.
Simon kicks Mars' helmet.
"What the fuck! Get the fuck off me you fucking cockmunch!"
He grabs Simon's foot.
Spikes catch on Idrethal's chest, legs, and arms. He groans.
Mars sprints after the yak'cho.
Mars shoots Aradia's handcuffs.
"I swear on fucking Ya'shasa." 
"Drop the fucking mine or the next one blows your brains out."
Simon fires next to Aradia's head.
"I'll go get that Taxi."
"Aw fuck me."
There's a ship above the roof.
"No way." Lzi frowns. "You wanna go over there?"
"I'm gonna grab us a taxi."
"Cause I don't. Fuck that shit."
"Do you wanna be here when the city gets nuked?"
"Pretty sure that means we can go home if we want."
"He fuckin just opened one of those hole things and left."
"You guys fucking saw that, right?"
The mouse dude shouts some more, then shoots next to Aradia's head.
He sees them kneeling by the edge of the roof. They're clearly bound and there's an angry looking mouse dude yelling at them with a gun to their heads.
"Yeah, up on the roof there, surrounded by all those lizard dudes."
"Yeah, up on the roof there, surrounded by all those lizard dudes.
"Hey, that looks like Uti and Aradia up on the roof."
"Fine..." Lzi goes back to his spot and keeps looking around.
I'm trying to do our fucking job, guys. Shut the fuck up.
"Mars, try and get a picture of the hat."
"What? Scopes can't do that." "Only the binoculars can."
He rolls a [17/13] to keep it steady.
"Thirty degrees north-northwest."
"Thirty degrees North-Northwest."
"Carny, check it out." Lzi hands her the rifle scope."
"It's uh, a lady with a pink hat. Holy shit that's the stupidest hat ever."
That's stupid. Lzi, check who's inside that taxi.
That's stupid. Lzi, check who's inside that Taxi.
Can't. Go. Into space.
The taxi's can't go into space.
"It's uh! It's... ah. It's just another taxi."
"OH!" Lzi shouts. "I see something!"
They're so loud.
So far it hasn't left yet.
They're watching out to see when Kaiden's escape shuttle leaves, so they can report its coordinates to Zacht, so Zacht can kill Kaiden from the comfort of Zacht's space yacht or whatever.
"Sure. No prob."
The team has been hanging out in Kaiden's second conference room for fifteen minutes.
He's tired, he's got a headache. And apparently the entire city is about to be nuked or some shit.
That was the only resistance he's ran into for this entire mission.
His team consists of himself, Lzi, Ragenirsak, Carniryaka, and six grunts who's names he can not remember for the life of him.
"Everyone pack up. We're heading to the roof. Small Boy, wait here for your transport ship."
"Good try." Idrethal says.
"Fuck." Aradia sighs.
She puts her palm to her chin, but her oxium doesn't activate.
A scan of the cuffs reveals that they're likely made with purge oxium. They're draining him of oxium and halting any external effects. They might also sever his connection to his respawner.
Simon sprays the gum on Uti's hands to free them, then he snaps a pair of handcuffs on Uti.
[Team Turn!]
Idrethal rolls a [15/15] to shoot Distan.
A stray bullet scrapes her side but she's mostly unscathed.
"AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!"
She rolls a [14/14] to try to reach her satchel, and her hand gets caught on the gum that's covering it.
All of the little lights on Wrought's body shut off.
all of the little lights on Wrought's body shut off.
Wrought rolls an [8/20] for survival.
gare's ice sculpture begins to crumble.
"I CANT MOVE ANYTHING."
"I'M FUCKING TRYING AAAH!"
"You've got five minutes to change your mind." Idrethal says.
"You've got five minutes to change your mind."
"Kaiden's probably already on his transport ship out of here."
"Kaiden's probably already on his transport ship out of here.
"Just fucking surrender so we can get the fuck out of here!" Simon shouts.
Small Boy takes one heavy step and lays down a line of covering fire for his boss.
Idrethal's grenade explodes, but the effect washes off his coat.
Simon runs over to Uti and rolls an [18/14] to hit him with the gum gun.
Ori is shredded by bullets.
Uti stabs straight through the grunt's face, while Distan shoots the right one in the gut.
They've got the cuffs in their hands.
A pair of Terogoids march up to Uti and Distan.
"Fine. Put them in the anti-respawner cuffs. Give them what they want." 
"So you're coming with us and we're evacuating."
"Lord Wolf has already given the go-ahead for his fleet to glass this city."
"You'll come with us if you don't want to die in a few minutes."
"You
"We're taking you onto our ship and evacuating."
"Turn around, and put your hands behind your backs."
"I told you goatfuckers not to move." He says.
"I told you  goatfuckers not to move." He says.
"Or Small Boy gets to kill you all." He nods at the lizard behind him.
Idrethal growls. "Now,  surrender." 
"Holy shit." Aradia blinks.
There's a few thuds from the room upstairs.
Idrethal's grenade explodes in a blast of cold air.
Ori tries to pull his foot out, but doesn't really get anywhere in the few seconds it takes for the gum to reform.
"Woah! What the fuck!" The dude shouts.
Aradia's grenade exlplodes.
The knot is really really bad.
The pellets expand  into bubbles of sticky gum, and Gare falls onto the ground.
The shot cracks Ori's helmet and gives him a minor concussion.
The shot cracks Ori's helmet, and gives him a minor concussion.
The shot scrapes against Distan's shoulder. It hurts, but not too much.
Idrethal rolls a [4/15] to hit.
Uti's shot hit's him in the throat and he drops.
It's wadded around his boot. He could probably shoot it and rip it.
He takes both hits, but is still standing.
Ori's foot suddenly feels very heavy.
One of uti's hands is wrapped to his torso, but the other is free.
The bola wraps around Uti. He can't use his Oxium.
He dodges around the spray, only taking a single hit from Simon's shot on the tip of his foot. The bullet doesn't hurt. 
Gare's shot hits the grunt in his wrist, shattering the bones in the joint.
Idrethal doesn't respond.
"Boss, did you see that?"
The terogoid rolls a [3/12] to resist.
"Then, if they attack, kill them." The large Terogoid replies.
"Idreth, they think I'm stalling." Simon says out loud.
Simon seems like he's stalling.
"Already gone."
The rest of the Terogoids aim at Uti's group but don't shoot immediately.
"Don't you fucking move!" 
Idrethal tosses a small box at Wrought's feet.
The alien is knocked off it's feet.
The grenade explodes.
"On three?"
"On three?
"Okay."
"Not too many. One of those self replenishing grenades, one more thermal charge, and a single vortex grenade left."
"Not too many. One of those self replenishing grenade, one more thermal charge, and a single vortex grenade left."
"Not too many. One of those self replenishing otspring, one more thermal charge, and a single vortex grenade left."
It's a rather excellent floor.
Gare looks around between everyone. "So who's going in first?"
"So who's going in first?"
It's pretty easy to notice, because it's the only door with a heavy stain on the bottom, from all the people who must kick the door open.
Kaiden's office is on the right.
It's red, black, gold, and brown.
"I don't know what it was all about, but I thought it might be good for you to know."
"Oh, by the way, I'm pretty sure I saw a parachute above the building. While we were in the elevator."
"Down the hallway then." Aradia says.
It creaks a bit under Wrought's weight.
Uti hears the elevator begin to move.
"Oh shit, Wrought get in here."
"Okay, getting out now-what the fuck!"
I'm at like floor 10, though.
"I'm still in the elevator, Gare says.
It says, "Trazch's office" and points left.
There's a plaque on the wall, right across from where the elevator points.
The door opens up, and there's a long hallway.
"So I guess Yvelte's team fucked up."
"So I guess Yvelte's team fucked up.
"Oh yikes."
Gare stops holding the door. They start heading up.
Wrought doesn't make any motion to show that he registered that information.
"Wrought, you're gonna have to take the next elevator." Aradia sighs.
"Wrought you're gonna have to take the next elevator." Aradia sighs.
"That's not gonna work."
"Oh jeez." Aradia groans. "No."
He's holding his head.
Gare's holding the door open.
He's not going to fit.
"Yes!" He says. "Of course, it's just.... Those are a lot of guns."
The guy stares at Uti for a moment. Then he nods. "Um. Yeah. Ok. I'll just. notifymrtrazchwhileyou'reonyou'rewayup.
"Uh. Oh, wow." He rubs his forehead. "D-do you have an appointment?"
They're unlocked.
"So we're in for a long elevator ride, I take it?" Aradia asks.
"So we're in for a long elevator ride, I take it?
She isn't sure though.
There's a bridge connecting the two to a central building at maybe the tenth floor.
There's a bridge connecting the two to a center building at maybe the tenth floor.
"We know he'll be in one of the two, but the towers were designed to deflect assassination attempts."
"He could be in either tower."
"Good. Luden's previous offices were on the 50th floor. Kaiden is known to enjoy using Luden's property. It's likely he's set up his own office in the same place."
"Good. Luden's previous offices were on the 50th floor. And Kaiden is known to enjoy using Luden's property. It's likely he's set up his own office in the same place.
"Uti," The Zachthazel says. "I just received word that Mars and his team have entered the west tower. How is your team doing?"
Uti's team reaches the base of Sekko Tower East.
Uti's team reaches the base of Sekko Tower.
yeah, c'mon voraj.
what's going o-oh shit.
Tracy follows Raros' glance.
Raros looks up, and can't see the sun, since it's being blocked by a ship.
Raros remembers it's only been about an hour since they got here.
It's dark, but it was only midday when they entered the station.
... i'll do it.
She's unconscious.
Raros notices the door closing.
He doesn't see a Vasha to shoot.
It's like being cooked alive.
Each of the charges activate. A five foot sphere of enthalpy energy begins to melt through the terminal.
He's so tired of getting his attacks dodged that he doesn't shoot at all.
Tracy watches as the bullet wounds on Shanta burst, and she spouts blood all over the floor, the base of the terminal, and Vasha's boots.
Voraj's leg spews piles of fat and flesh.
She doesn't quite manage to block in time, and takes the 8 shots in the chest and stomach.
He also pulls out a handgun and rolls a [1] to shoot Kisket.
Vasha appears right next to Shanta. He sprays her with the Uzi.
One of the five sticks to the terminal, but it isn't activated.
one of the five sticks to the terminal, but it isn't activated.
one of the five sticks to the wall, but it isn't activated.
She rolls a [71/100] for luck.
All the bullet wounds explode. Blood jets out of all 8 of them.
Vasha leaves the knife in Voraj's leg and hops back.
Voraj's leg begins to throb.
"Animals it is."
"It would be preferable if you didn't, but I don't think I'd be too worried if you did."
"No." Vasha says. "Not unless you do the same."
"Now how are we going to do this?"
"We can settle this like adults or like animals." Vasha says.
"Now how are we going to do this."
"Alright."
"You're all adults, you can manage a couple lines!"
"You heard him, all of you out. Two single file lines please, like you've practiced in the drills."
Vasha turns back to Raros. "Is it alright with you if they leave? They're civilians, and they don't get paid enough to make this job worth dying for."
Vasha turns back to Shanta. "Is it alright with you if they leave? They're civilians, and they don't get paid enough to make this job worth dying for."
Vasha turns back to Shanta. "Is it alright with you if they leave?" They're civilians, and they don't get paid enough to make this job worth dying for."
He turns to the workers for a moment. "Did you all finish sending those messages?"
"I'm Vasha-en. This is my facility that you've just attacked."
"Here, I'll start." He removes his helmet. He's an amphiron with small yellow eyes.
"I think I have the right to know."
The guy doesn't listen.
"Who are you and what are you doing here?"
The workers sit quietly, but don't continue to send messages.
"Calm down." The guy says.
The guard and the man in black armor are watching as the office workers furiously send a message over text, radio, phone call, and encrypted messages.

Wrought doesn't know what to do with his head.
He spots Wrought's head under one of the guard's bodies.
He can't find his head.
"Wrought, where's your head at?"
She tosses it to Uti.
"Catch."
"Uti!"
The first guy's face is turned into a bloody mess. The back of the first guy's helmet breaks the second guy's nose.
The nail hits him and he's cooked in his skin.

[Guard group 1 rolls a 5 to hit Uti, while guard group 2 rolls a 3 to shoot wrought.]
[Guard group rolls a 5 to hit Uti, while guard group 2 rolls a 3 to shoot wrought.]
The bullets ploink off Wrought's back, one takes a chip off the metal.
He punches the man's head into his own shoulders.
They're both turned into pincushions.
The bullet whizzes past Aradia's head.
Wrought's head pops off.
Aradia's bolt misses, but she's too busy digging through her bag to notice.
Gare runs through the hole Wrought made and rolls a [10/9] to shoot the same guy Ori shot.
[The guys on the left and middle roll 1's to resist, while the guy on the right rolls a 17/12.]
The grenade singes a solid portion of Wrought's back and pushes him forward.
He gets hit by all the bullets, but doesn't seem to notice.
Uti's blood puddle gets pelted by two bullets.
"Oh shit!" Aradia shouts. "Wrought, run! That's an enthalpy grenade!"
Most of the bullets bounce off him harmlessly, but many leave dents in his chassis.
[Enemy turn!]
Kisket covers the neck wound with puffy gauze and wraps her neck a few times with surgical tape.
Wrought charges at the tankard truck, but quickly realizes that he's too big to slide under it.
"Okay."
"All done, I think."
"All done, I think.
Using a finger, she cuts a little line into the side of the tank.
"But whatever, I'll go try."
"But whatever, I'll go try.
"If I try to explode something that's flammable, though there's a pretty high chance it'll catch on fire. Just cause of all the particles flying around."
"My power isn't flammable if I'm using it to like erase a hole in the side of the tank."
"I could try that." Aradia says
Wrought stops.
"Shit." Aradia says.
"Shit."
There's a line of twenty five guards crouched behind empty cars.
"It's something my squad would do if we were trying to hold an area against like a really big force of GP grunts."
"It's something my squad would do if we were trying to hold an area against like a really big force of GP grunts.
"No, I bet there are guards on the other side, waiting to shoot the oil tanks as soon as they see someone they don't recognize." Gare nods.
No, I bet there are guards on the other side, waiting to shoot the oil tanks as soon as they see someone they don't recognize.
"This looks like a trap." Gare frowns.
It's carrying three oil tankards.
A block away, there's a massive truck blocking the intersection.
He didn't cover his eyes at all.
Gare's face is frozen in a mixture of shock, horror, and awe.
The guy's head squishes like a pumpkin.
Wrought isn't sure if he's dead or not.
The guard's head snaps back and he's knocked unconscious.
"MY HEAD HURTS SO BAD!"
"FUCKING! SHIT!"
"Aaaaaagh!"
"I went to highschool with that dude."
"WHAT THE FUCK!"
"AAAAAAH!!!!"
"But he really needs medical help."
"But he really needs medical help.
"I gotta send a message to the coms tower so they can call in support.
"Do you think you can take this guy with you?"
"Shit, really?" The less fucked up guard says.
"It's not safe."
"It's not safe.
"You guys gotta get outta here."
"A fucking chromatin just. Dropped out of the sky and started killing everyone!"
"Shit, what are you guys doing over here?!" The one without the spike calls.
There are a pair of guards, looking incredibly fucked up, limping through the street.
"Think that's the Ophidiate's distraction?"
There's some smoke coming from a building a little ways away ahead of them.
There's some smoke coming from a building a little ways away.
They jog to the first turn and make a right.
"I doubt Mars had to deal with any of this bullshit."
"I doubt Mars had to deal with any of this bullshit.
"Alright, lets get going!"
"I'm just trying to say it's very, very impressive."
"You had literally every guard in that building coming after you."
"I can't believe you made it out of there." Aradia says.
They all make it outside.
"Hah yeah, later!"
"Okay, just keep an eye on it. If it starts getting out of control call us. We'll take care of it."
"Is the robot thing gonna follow you?"
"We'll wait here."
"Yeah sure, go for it."
"Did you say stored???"
"Did you say stored???
"There.... What????" The first guard says.
They can also try to talk their way out of it.
Wrought follows Distan.
There isn't a door to close.
"No problem."
"No worries." The fish guy says. "I'll find someone else."
The fish guy grins. "Gary you're crazy." He nods. "Get outta here and go get your girl that spicy shit."
The fish guy grins. "Gary you're crazy." He nods. "Get outta here and go get your girl that spice shit."
He doesn't like where that's headed.
He's heard all the rumors.
"I uh.... I don't know."
"What? Really? Why'd you say you weren't busy, guy?"
"What?"
"What?
"Oh, uh. Okay."
"Awesome, perfect. Follow me, I need your help with the escalator really quick."
"Uh.... Nothing?"
"Hey you, what are you doing?"
"Okay."
"But like what if they ask me to do something for them?
"I don't know the first thing about mechanicy."
"I don't know the first thing about mechanicy.
"But guys." Gare says.
"But guys."
"Yeah, he'd make a convincing mechanic I think." Aradia says.
"Yeah, he'd make a convincing mechanic I think.
"Who goes with Wrought?"
"Who goes with Wrought?
"Okay." Aradia says.
"It would be totally weird if six people in jumpsuits came out of here in  a big group walks out of here out of nowhere."
"I was sorta thinking about that."
"I was sorta thinking about that.
"Armor off then?"
"I'd rather not get into a fight in the middle of that whole crowd." Aradia frowns.
"I'd rather not get into a fight in the middle of that whole crowd.
"WOAH!" The dude shouts as he falls.
Wrought steps back.
"Fine. Fuck it." 
"We're not here to fuck with the people that live here."
"That's some guy's lunch."
"No I'm not. It's loud as hell outside this door." Aradia frowns.
"Distan, what the fuck." Aradia whispers.
The lunch bag contains a bag of apple slices, some crackers, and half a pb&amp;j
There's a gigantic bolt gun for adjusting the spikes on the subway rails.
There's a glass window on a door that leads into the station itself, and there seems to be a lot of pedestrians walking around.
There isn't currently anyone inside with them.
They're inside the employee section.
"Theres an exit to the subway that's fifty yards to the east of you."
"The Gps is running a little off since you're underground, but you should be about a mile northeast of the target."
"The Gps is running a little off since you're underground, but you should be northwest of the target."
"Borealis is occupied."
They're standing on a raised platform in between the two subway lanes.
Uti's team climbs a ladder into an empty subway rail.
It's pretty difficult, but she doesn't mention that fact.
Like a piggy back, but I'll hold her arms or something.
Like a piggy back, but i'll hold her arms or something.
And Voraj looks like she's enjoying herself.
of fuckin course not
you totally just pressed random buttons.
that's the fuckin easiest oxium power ever.
im not jealous, fuck you.
that's the fuckin easiest oxium power ever
wow. that's fucking bullshit.
wait are we fuckin stuck in here because a fuckin door's locked?
i've always just thought of you as the kind of guy who knows a little bit of everything.
i don't... know?
i said you're good with computers and shit
raros, you're good with computers and shit right?
ok lets try and get it open.
you're probably right.
there's also the third floor.
"Through that big door?" Kisket nods at the door.
It's fine.
"Oh..." Kisket nods.
"Oh... "
You don't want to pick up wounded people.
i don't see any other way up.
kis says we'll come up.
"Don't bring her down!" Kisket shouts through Tracy's radio.
hey, everything good?
it's been pretty quiet up there after that last explosion.
it's been pretty quiet up there after that last exposion.
The guard spurts blood all over Voraj's face.
[Team Turn!]
The other guard is suddenly terrified of Voraj. 
Guard 2 rolls a [17] to shoot Shanta.
He drops, bleeding profusely, but doesn't die.
The grenade explodes.
The guard socks the shit outta Voraj.
Voraj pulls on the guard's arm and throws him to the ground. She gouges his throat while he's down.
Yvelte's grenade explodes.
There are a bunch of guards sitting at or standing around a bunch of computers.
"And besides, Sekko Corp doesn't hire bounty hunters. It's company policy.
"And besides,  Sekko Corp doesn't hire bounty hunters. It's company policy.
"And then I'll go to the bathroom downstairs and we'll pretend this never happened."
"Look, I'll let it slide. You guys get out of the elevator, and I get in."
"With the attack going on and everything? You're just gonna lie like that?"
"I don't get paid breaks."
"I'm on break. Please don't kill me while im on break."
He's got a cup of coffee and a ham sandwich in his hands.
"Okay."
Yvelte nods, "Cool, well can you and Voraj come with me, while everyone else stays here and makes sure no guards get in?"
Yvelte nods, "Cool, well can you and Voraj come with me, and everyone else, will stay here and make sure no guards get in?"
"Who's good with technology, here?"
"But make sure he doesn't go anywhere."
"Don't kill him, please." Yvelte asks, pointing to the receptionist.
There's a receptionist at the front.
"This way, into the building."
"Im sure most of them are currently dealing with the attack outside." Yvelte says.
"Im sure most of them are currently dealing with the attack outside."
that's pretty weird.
There aren't any guards in the outer courtyard.
There's a pretty standard looking gate.
watch where you're fuckin aiming those things.
The guard isn't knocked out, but he is dazed.
A hole appears in the mid left guard's head.
A hole appears in the leftmost guard's head.
It doesn't hurt, but it's rather shocking.
Before she has a chance to bite him, the middle left guy punches her in the nose.
The middle right guard rolls a 16/10 to dodge.
[ COMBAT START!!!! ]
dude why'd you go talk to the guys we've gotta like kill in a second.
"You too!" The guard waves.
"Alright, then."
"Arlight, then."
"That's an aeginaeas ID, you can carry, but you need permissions from the bounty hunter's station on the Precipice if you want to actually use your weapons. If you want I can give you directions on how to get there."
"That's an aeginaeas ID, you can carry, but you need permissions from the bounty hunter's station on the Precipice if you want to actually use your weapons. If you want I can give you directions on how to get there.
"There weren't any details like who or what given out yet. Just the call to be on guard and set up the perimeter."
"There weren't any details like who or when given out yet. Just the call to be on guard and set up the perimeter."
"I'm not too sure of the situation, but rest assured, we're gonna have everything handled in no time."
"There was an attack a few blocks west of here. The area is sectioned off, so there will be guards to steer you clear of it if you start heading that way."
"You guys stay safe."
"Okay!"
"Hey!" Guard 1 shouts. "Do you guys have a license for those?"
Upon rounding the corner they notice a group of four guards, who seem relatively unconcerned that they're there at all.
"Okay, lets get going." Aradia nods.
There's oil running out of cracks in the paneling and a line of unlit lights running along the ceiling.
It's a little dank and decrepit, from years of disuse.
"This would have been pretty hard without you."
"Wow, you're like one of those aliens from uh, avatar, this sorta old earth movie."
"Wrought, stop!"
Wrought doesn't make any sign of having understood any of that.
In about a minute and fourty-five seconds, there's a hole big enough for three of them to fit through at a time.
"Wow." Aradia nods.
"Really?"
"That's a cool oxium power."
"It's remote activated, don't worry about like, setting it off preemptively."
"It's remote activated, don't worry about like, setting it off preemptively 
"The charges are supposed to superheat it and melt a hole through them."
"It's a titanium alloy. Yvelte told me that"
It's made of a really obscure metal-like plastic.
It's made of some sorta metal.
It's made of...
"Yeah."
"So maybe if you could stuff them in your suit, Ori? So you can walk invisible under the cameras and place them?"
"Mars has the other pair with his team."
"I've got two of these, but they're designed to get through those doors within two or three minutes."
"Hmm."
"That's super useful!"
"That sounds useful." Aradia says.
"Do the things you carry turn invisible as well?"
"That sounds useful."
"It's okay. Pretty sure it was my fault anyway."
"I've been told I'm a very nice guy. And Umbran used me as a meat shield once."
"I don't have any oxium."
"Entropy." Aradia says. "Close ranged erasure or explosion of just about anything."
"It does different things if I do different things with my hands."
"Entropy. Close ranged erasure or explosion of just about anything."
Wrought doesn't say anything.
"You know mine."
"There's a lot of dust and shit. I could try to blow it at the cameras, or something."
"There's a lot of dust and shit. I could try to blow it at the cameras, or something."/
"There's a lot of dust and shit I could try to blow it at the cameras, or something."
"What do you want to do about them?" She asks
"Yeah, that could have been bad."
"How're we gonna get in? Do we knock on the door?"
"So." Gare says. "That's a big wall."
The Precipice's wall stretches upward ahead of them.
"And the precipice is just called that because it's on the edge of a bigass sink hole?”
At least this means they can't see us
"Like spicy in the metaphorical sense?" Aradia raises an eyebrow.
"And the precipice is just called that because it's on the edge of a bigass sink hole?
"It's literally just a trench full of spice." Aradia frowns.
"It's literally just a trench full of spice."
Uti's ship contains Distan, Aradia, Wrought, Ori, and Gare.
Uti and Mars' teams are in separate transport ships. They're going to be entering through tunnels on opposite sides of the city.
"Lets start making our way over, we want to get there early if possible."
"So the comms tower northeast from here."
Yvelte adjusts her cloak so the hood hides her face a little better. It's a deep blue color, with yellow lining on the inside.
Their ship is scanned for any contraband and a few guards ask to see their Aeginaeas IDs before they're allowed to bring their weaponry into the city.
"That'd be the distraction I'd talked about." Yvelte nods.
They're in one of the smaller ports, closer to the sinkhole than the city proper.
I haven't heard of these.
No I couldn't.
kisket could piss someone off while doing one of those "my cat's stuck in a tree" bounties
I don't think I piss a lot of people off on missions.
What the fuck. In the Trenches? Why use the front door?
I actually can't tell.
we're too cool to get shot.
cause that's not gonna happen
I don't know, you're suddenly being all pessimistic.
No shit you bought it on Zenithon. We haven't been anywhere else.
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that?"
"Rest up, all of you. Tomorrow will likely be a long day." Zacht shoos everyone out.
"Lovely." Zacht says. "Thank you, Miss Ketush."
"My job will be to make sure that doesn't happen."
"Okay. In the meantime, my team and I will attack the coms center. I know for a fact he's got some form of pirate protection that will come to his defense as soon as he makes a call."
"In that time she'll be drawing as much attention as possible, so no matter which option you choose, you should only have to deal with a minimal amount of resistance."
"The Ophidiate will drop into the Precipice from orbit and attack the Sekko Corp. Warehouse ten minutes before you make your entrance." Zacht says.
"The Ophidiate will drop into the Precipice from orbit and attack the Sekko Corp. Warehouse ten minutes before you make your entrance.
"I'm the distraction."
"The soldiers won't be your problem." The Ophidiate speaks up.
"The problems with the first two options are pretty self-evident," Yvelte says, "But the problem with the third is that the outer layers of the walls are incredibly thick. Breaching them will either make a very large commotion, or take a very, very long time. Without some form of distraction, that option would be impossible."
"Lastly you could breach the wall. There are six layers to the wall, and each of them have a multitude of entrances and exits, to the point where it would be impossible to guard them all."
"The second is through one of several emergency escape ports that lead into the spice trenches. several of these have been kept secret, though it's been long enough that the possibility that Kaiden knows of the ports is very real."
Yvelte nods back. "There are three methods of entering the city. The first is to enter through the ports, where ships are scanned and checked both automatically by scanners and manually by workers."
Yvelte nods back. "There are three methods of entering the city. The first is to enter through the ports, where ships are scanned and checked both automatically by scanners and manually by workers.
"I'm here to give details on how you can discretely enter the Precipice in order to assassinate Kaiden Trazch."
A tan kordovan in a black pinstripe suit enters the room.
"Hello." Yvelte nods.
"That fact irritates me. Regardless, by the end of tomorrow, Kaiden Trazch will be dead, and leadership of both the city and the company will transfer to miss Yvelte Ketush." He says, then says, louder. "If you would be so kind as to enter, now, Yvelte."
"Somehow, this was only brought to my attention very recently." Zacht sighs.
"The man has all but stopped the company's previous relations with Monad, and has instead been making deals with pirates, and GP."
"Some of you may already know of Kaiden Trazch, the current president of the Precipice and the de-facto head of Sekkocorp." 
"So. I've brought you here today because you will all be participating in an attack on the Precipice."
Zacht drums his fingers on the table a for a little bit. The Ophidiate folds her arms and doesn't say anything.
"Uh. Fine. Okay." She turns and leaves.
"Wait really?"
"Oh, no." Zacht sighs. "Jannessen, I apologize, we won't be needing you for this mission, you're free to go."
"No." Zacht says.
"The same goes with you, Eucalid."
"I don't think you understand." Zacht takes his feet off the table and sits properly. "You are not required for this mission. Leave the room."
"Artesh, you may take your leave now. You are excused."
"He can go." Zacht waves a hand toward the door.
"That's why you don't choose to bring Artesh," The Zachthazel nods.
Zacht frowns. "You had your pick of the litter and you chose Artesh?"
Zacht frowns. "You had your pick of the litter and you chose _Artesh?_"
The Zachthazel looks up and notices him enter.
Who's gonna knock?
There's a window that looks inside.
Well, maybe.... yeah. I guess it's more like, he's bearable. 
I was gonna say that he's surprisingly cool, when he's outside, wearing like, people clothes.
Mars' jaw drops.
"It's been a while, though, Distan." Aradia says, "How've you been?"
"Yeah, I mean... He's big, and threatening, and scary."
It's from the Zachthazel. It reads: "Good morning. I would like each you to gather two reticles and report to Confrence Room 203 in the relations office."
It's from the Zachthazel. It reads: "Good morning. I would like each you to find two reticles and report to Confrence Room 203 in the relations office."
"Yeah." She says.
"So..... Zacht says," breaking the heavy silence once more. "Read any good books lately?"
Zacht estimates that it'll be another twenty before anyone arrives.
They've been waiting fifteen minutes.
She's glaring at the clock mounted on the wall.
Sitting next to him, on the right is the Ophidiate.
Zacht is sitting at the head of the table, furthest from the door, with his feet up on the desk. He swivels in tiny increments, back and forth while he waits
AND THE ZACHTHAZEL SAYS, "YO."
The Zachthazel is sitting in a conference room in the relations office. There's a long oval table, made of real polished wood. It's hard to find real wood in these offices, which is why whenever the Zachthazel needs to come here, he makes sure to reserve this conference room well in advance.

"The freaky part's up by his head."
"Alright." Aradia says, "Thanks, really."
Im pretty sure Arkahn would have my arm cut off if he found out i did that...
"Why would you do that though?"
"Really?" Aradia frowns.
But it's definitely getting worse.
I haven't like told anyone.
Aradia doesn't touch hers.
It's getting way worse. The oxium stuff.
He absorbs the rock, shuts his eyes, and the thing folds into itself until there's nothing left.
The head's own arms begin to reach out toward him as well.
"Shit!"
She grabs a rock, and slams the drawer shut, but it slips from her fingers and clatters under the bed.
The hands on Mars' arms let go too, followed by the rest of them.
They let go of Mars' neck.
They let go of Mar's neck.
Mars's face is pushed upside down toward Uti and Aradia. He's being choked too hard to say anything.
The hands around Mars' neck grip tighter, and push him downward.
STOP STOP STOP STOP IT'S GETTING PISSED OFF.
"Yeah, that's fine."
"But like, take off your shoes, please.
"Go ahead if you think you need to."
"I'm alright."
"Uh. Hi. Profernicus."
"Oh," Aradia says. 
There's a knock on the door, and Aradia lets, them in.
Aradia nods, "Any time."
"Do you want any?"
"I want to make some coffee."
"Waking up looking at that, was... Not a good start to my morning."
"Okay."
"Someone's coming then?"
"03482"
It's very bloody inside that hand.
The hand scrapes off some more of Mars' skin as he tries to push Mars' arm out of the hand's grip.
It's a very tight squeeze, but he manages to slide between the hand on Mars' forearm, and his skin.
"Sure."
"I think the hands are dead."
"It's like rock or metal or something."
"It's like rock or metal or something.
"It's actually very solid."
"It's not soft."
"I'll touch it with my prosthetic."
Uti hears a series of rips as Mars' skin is torn where the hands grip it.
Aradia positions herself next to the bed.
"Okay."
"But... I don't know, maybe?"
"I don't want to touch those things."
"They like, roll back into his head."
"I tried prying his eyes open."
"He won't wake up, either."
"I was going to try to...  I don't know, use my oxium on it. But I'm very worried I might catch him in the blast."
"I was going to try to...  I don't know, use my Oxium on it. But I'm very worried I might catch him in the blast."
I was going to try to...  I don't know, use my Oxium on it. But I'm very worried I might catch him in the blast.
"No."
The hands are attached to human arms, and human shoulders. A head, half embedded into the ceiling seems to look down at the back of Mars' head.
He's hanging about a foot from the ceiling, the hands reach down to grip him by the feet, ankles and shins on his legs, around the stomach and chest, and his forearms and wrists.
He can't really see anything from the doorway.
He can't really see anything from the doorway."
"The freaky part's the up by his head."
"The freaky part's the up by his head.
"I don't fucking know."
"It's weird, but that's not the freaky part."
"It's weird, but that's not the freaky part.
They're gripping Mars' legs
Hanging above Aradia's bed is a tangled mass of black stone hands.
Inside Aradia's room there's a bed, a desk, and a closet next to the door to the bathroom.
"I woke up and he was like... Over here, come here."
"Uti, he's not on the couch."
"Uti, that's a pillow..."
"I'm..." Aradia frowns.
"That's not the problem."
"No, uh."
"Uh."
It is very apparent that Mars is not on the couch.
It is very apparent that ya boi is not on the couch.
Aradia's apartment is made up of two main rooms, one is a living room/kitchen, with an island separating the two of them.
"We've all got tight schedules all the time."
"Unless you're busy."
"You should come next time."
"Really?" Aradia frowns. "I mean... yeah."
She's not wearing any shoes.
Aradia's wearing sweatpants and a tee shirt.
"Right."
"Thanks, I'll wait out here."
"With something.... Cause it's sort of freaking me out."
"With something, cause it's sort of freaking me out.
"But I woke up this morning and I just sorta want you to come help me out."
"Well, he blacked out and I dragged him back to my room so he could sleep on the couch. And not like get dicks drawn on his face while he was out there on the couch."
"Cause uh, Jan kept him doing shots for like an hour."
"Cause uh, Jan kept him doing shots for like an hour
"But you know how he got absolutely wasted at the party last night."
"Well, no."
"Yeah, sort of."
"Hey uh."
It's Aradia's voice.
"Wake up!"
"Uti!"
It's 8:11 in the morning.
Aradia frowns.
"No leaving." She groans.
Aradia's eyebrows shoot way up.
She pokes at the ship's thrusters, obliterating the mechanisms within.
that's fucking crazy!
that's fucking crazy.
like it was having fifty heart attacks, like at the same time.
the planet's alive right?
shanta's brother has blood oxium so don't fight him hand to hannnnnn...... wait.
cause shanta's brother's in there.
I don't feel bad, and I'm a doctor, Tracy.
Tracy wakes up once they're on the ship.
The back thing is still there, but it looks like it's melting.
Ten portals open as he's purged, and hands reach out from within them, grasping at nothing. Tracy is dropped unceremoniously in front of Raros.
Kisket heads to Mars, rolls an [8/10] to purge him, then drops a healing pack out of her bag on "accident."
Tracy doesn't come out though.
It doesn't physically show.
Wrought rolls a [10/19] to punch Susett in the gut.
She rolls an [8/15] to quickly kick out an Ethyrian's legs.
Mars's neck is exposed, ripe for the pickings.
Mars isn't paying attention.
YOU WON'T
BUT WHY???
I'm trying to do you a favor!
Dude, it's either I put you all in the hole, or my friends here kill you! Brutally!
Tracy shakes Mars' hand.
Tracy fires the Entrobounce at Parry, rolling a [4/12] for damage.
Eao rolls a [7/11] to hit Parry in the face with a spinning high kick.
Wrought rolls a [4/19] to punch the dude.
"And then shit started freaking the fuck out and... Lets just take a break, for like two minutes?"
"I just ran a fuckin mile and a half." Mars says.
"Holy shit..."
The bullet pings off the back of Wrought's head.
"Hey Kis!" Eao shouts.
aren't we waiting for kisket?
Tracy and Eao can't see Kisket through the massive stack of meat and metal that is Susett.
Hey Raros.
"On my way."
Kisket coughs over the radio, "Hey uh. Anyone there?"
don't like do any dumb shit raros.
"Shit...." Eao frowns.
you don't?
yeah.
"Wait we're what?" Eao asks.
we're gonna help him kill the chromatin that landed with us.
he's a big... aggressive guy.
it's tracy.
what's your name dude?
i'm on the radio, just got a message.
and i'm with eao now.
"Holy shit." Eao whispers.
"O-okay, this way."
Eao shrugs. "I couldn't get to her, and I didn't really want to anyway, so I just left.
"I saw the captain bitch, Don't know her name, but she was a couple levels down, uh, behind a huge metal grate thing."
"My gaydar is fucking firing off the charts right now, do I need to give you two some privacy?" Eao asks.
we're working with gp.
"I work for me." Eao shrugs.
i don't know.
"Holy shit Tracy, where did you find this guy?" Eao frowns.
...she's one of my teammates, uh, dude, she's cool.
...she's one of my teammates, uh, dude, she's cool
don't fuckin. choke her out, please.
that's one of my teammates.
i've also got another teammate around here.
i've got a medic and a sniper, somewhere around here.
one of them fell out of the station when we were fighting them.
no, i'm a bounty hunter. and gp hired us for fuckin chump change.
you fucker!
i'm not lying you fucking giant fuckin' asshole!
but they aren't paying us nearly enough for this shit!
im a fuckin bounty hunter dude, im with shanta!
This is the first time Tracy's heard Susett speak since he became Frankenstein's fucking monster.
He takes a mental snapshot of Osira's ass.
hasta la vista.
don't look at me.
you know what, fuck it, shanta, you go to the temple, i'll find our team and let them know what's up.
Tracy realizes that he's supposed to be over Shanta.
Tracy realizes that Uti's in the temple, then.
our team isn't wearing gp armor...
this is starting to look like one of those 'pack up and get the fuck out asap' missions.
Trembling, he reaches a hand up to Shanta's cheek, and brushes his fingers across it.
Sasha rolls a [16/10] to stay awake.
So instead of socking the shit out of Uti, he swings a wild haymaker at Anunda's head. 
Sasha tries to reload the rapid pistol and realizes he's out of ammo.
Sasha rolls a [5/15] to shoot the shit out of Uti with the rapid pistol.
Sasha rolls a [3/4] to use his oxium on Artifis.
Sasha reloads his rifle, and rolls a [1/10] to shoot Artifis.
Sasha rolls a [9/9] for oxium.
She also rolls a 6 to slice Uti's arms off as she jumps to her feet.
"Yeah, what the fuck?"
"Dude... What the fuck."
"Guh!"
He wakes up.
"Dude," Kate says, "Get the fuck up."
Everyone within range can't see outside of their immediate vicinity.
Kate's guts begin to spill onto the floor, and she frantically grasps at them, trying to hold them inside for a couple seconds.
Oxium Kate swings both of her swords at Uti's arms. [She rolls a 15 for accuracy.]
"Woah, woah, what the fuck?!
Kate 1 rolls a [6/17] to activate her stealth girl and moves 6
Sasha rolls a [17/10] to hit Uti.
Kate 1 and 2 move 6 and 8 spaces each.
"Oh what the fuck." Kate says.
"Oh what the fuck."
"It does sound like a distinctly vica-like thing to do, to be honest." Sasha says.
"Someone understands what a dude with a sniper is supposed to do in a fight. Thank you, Artifis."
"Holy shit finally."
"Holy shit finally.
"That was fucking pointless."
"That was fucking pointless.
"Why don't we like, just wait down there and ambush them? Why do I gotta watch for the fuckers?"
"I'm supposed to be watching for Monad?" Sasha says.
I'm supposed to be watching for Monad?
"Sasha, dude. The people. That were falling." Kate adds.
"Sasha, dude. The people. That were falling."
"Nobody's getting through the bombers anyway."
"Nobody's getting through the bombers anyway.
"There's all the fire and shit... And what the fuck am I even watching for?'
"Fuck you dude." Sasha calls back.
"Fuck you dude."
"Uhh.... Nah." Sasha says.
"Uhh.... Nah."
Sasha scuffs the shit out of the salt on the way down.
Fighters stream out of hangars along the sides of Harbinger and scramble toward the Coronach's bombers.
It's true.
"It can't be too different from a videogame."
"I know what's stop, and what's go."
"Wait what?!" The other Kate says. "You fucking slut."
"Why not send the other me?"
"Captain," Kate says.
Kisket feels her stomach and realizes there's a lot missing.
Her head smacks the wall and she's knocked unconscious.
He doesn't realize there's anything wrong.
Wrought does not react.
Wrought grabs Raros as he's getting pulled.
Tracy's chest drops to the floor in a sloppy mess.
She swipes her hand across Tracy's midsection and it disappears, becoming a splatter of blood across the floor.
Aradia's fists glow white.
With two quick jabs, Wought pounds Eao's ribs into the floor, shattering them, and turning Eao's organs into mush.
He rolls a [9/11] to hit.
Aradia rolls a [6/14] to place C4 on Tracy's back.
Mars's helmet gets knocked.
Mars fires an energy bolt into Tracy's leg. Tracy is flung across the floor.
Tracy rolls a [16/14] to resist.
Wrought's entire head, from the neck to the face is shredded.
Eao has no idea what's going on.
Wrought rolls a [17/19] to throw the guy into the wall.
Kisket rolls a [20/16] to resist.
Aradia throws a pair of flashbangs into the middle of Shanta's crew and the scientists.
well she's transporting us to her right?
we can fuckin take her.
she's old.
I've heard you mention steroids in like four different contexts now...
who's this?
"Christ."
"Also fair."
"Seriously. Vica, what's the retirement plan for Horror Squad like? Any sweet stipends?"
"After this I think I can safely say I've seen it all."
"Fair."
"What would have happened if we touched that salt, by the way?"
"Lets finish this shit quick then and go home."
"Right."
"Are you saying demons are fucking real now?"
"What are they doing here, summoning demons or some shit?"
"I don't fuckin know."
"It's salt?"
"It's salt?
"This place ain't right." Sasha notes.
"Sure thing boss." She nods and fucks up the positioning of the antenna.
Kate fiddles with her helmet's heart antenna.
we've fought her a few times.
a dude can't care about his...
i'm just worried!
are you sure about this mission? kisket just mouthed to me that she's on her period.
This time Tracy looks at Kisket.
Tracy taps on Shanta's shoulder.
She mouths back, "Stressed."
"you okay?" he mouths.
You sure? Cause apparently everyone's job except his seems to be, "Watch this ship on the monitor as it does nothing."
You sure? Cause apparently everyone's job except his seems to be "watch the ship on the monitor as it does nothing."
Isn't there anything... More important we should be doing?
Tracy whispers, to Eao.
This is my "very excited" face.
it's a valid fucking question, fuck off.
"You, I like." Eao says, offering a fist to Osira.
"That's what I'm fuckin talking about."
I'm Eao, freshly anointed.
I'm Eao, freshly annointed.
what's your name?
Eao swats at Tracy's head when he turns to look at the ship, and he ducks under the flying hand.
The Yak'djinn rep, Saladine ab Randar Abbanzol Halissad, or SaRAH, votes orange.

"Sounds like you're talking out your ass, Donny."
"My source tells me that you can't even land crafts on it to study it?"
"How the hell do you even expect to uh, 'derail or disarm,' that thing anyway?" Kaiden asks.
"Hmph, alright."
"I highly doubt this will affect me or my people, but, out of morbid curiosity, what sort of collateral damage would we be looking at were you to destroy this thing?"
"Fine."
"Why the fuck are we all here for this important matter that has literally nothing to do with us?"
"I think it is relevant," he relies.
"What the fuck does this have to do with me?" He says.
Kaiden Trazch raises his hand.
A few days later, a report comes back, from the Phora's Well Hunt Museum attack.
... thanks, raros.
i feel like i'm a shitty teammate.
that's what teams do...
yeah, but like. we're supposed to stick through the sucky shit together.
i can't believe i fucking wasn't there.
"Alenah Brey, signing off."
A few days later, a report comes back, from the Phora's well Hunt Museum attack.
Raros' inspiring words send the crowd into a frenzy.
Peri doesn't give a fuck about that.
Kisket wants to shoot but doesn't want to hit the person Maw's holding.
"I TOLD YOU YOU DON'T WANNA FIND OUT WHY THEY CALL ME THE MAW."
"THAT'S ONE, MOTHERFUCKER."
"Clearly you must not give a FUCK about everyone's arms and legs, don't you?!" Maw shouts at Mermix.
"I thought I said if any of you move, I rip off everyone's arms and legs and eat them, one by one!" Maw shouts.
"I thought I said if any of you move, I rip off everyone's arms and legs and eat them, one by one!"
"What the fuck. Is going on now?"
"What the fuck are you doing man?!" The person shouts.
One of the people on the ground grabs Mermix's ankle.
She's up on her feet, with barely a scratch.
She's flung off her feet, but curls up into a ball and rolls.
"WHAT THE FUCK?!"
"AGH!" The Maw shouts.
Kisket motions that that's fucking crazy, and did Raros see what the fuck he just did to Voraj and how she really needs to heal that raptor.
He turns and heads back to whatever he was doing earlier.
"Just fucking run, shitcocks."
"Bitch. Don't do that again."
He catches the knife and it disappears.
Kisket stands and rolls a [3] to shoot at Maw.
He's about ten feet away.
The flesh on Maw's neck reknits itself. 
Raros has Mermix's attention.
He's taking a peek at the fight that's going on currently, he looks horrified.
Shanta's knife sticks Maw in the back of the neck.
The Maw frowns.
Maw bares his teeth.
"Maw bares his teeth.
"Fuck you! Fuck you!"
"Are you?!"
"Are you fucking playing GAMES with me kid?"
Raros' entire body does a 180. His head replaces his feet on the floor, and his feet fly straight into the air.
Raros' entire body does a 180. his head replaces his feet on the floor, and his feet fly straight into the air.
"WHAT'D YOU SAY?"
Maw bends to put his face inches away from Raros' face.
"What'd you say?"
The Maw's eyes are bugging the fuck out now.
The Maw turns around fully to face Raros.
The Maw turns around fully to face Raros..
"I'm going to hit you in the motherfucking face, with my motherfucking hand." The Maw nods, wide eyed.
And then I'm going to shove my dick so far down all of your throats that it comes out your asses."
And then I'm going to shove my dick so far down all of your throats that it comes out your asses.
"I'm going to kill all of these people in this room.
"What the fuck..."
And now if he wants to use any more he has to bring out his actual, competent men whose lives he sort of does mind losing, if not for their actual worth, than for the amount of time he's sank into acquiring them.
"Sorry for leaving and all, but I'm uh. I'm not going back down there at least until that ship is gone, so you better find a good place to hide."
"Okay."
"Uh."
"Uh, yeah. I took off when I saw the motherfucking Spindle Demon heading straight for me..." He takes a breath. "Are you still alive???"
He shoots at Voraj while looking at Raros and manages to graze her back.
The middle left dude's face becomes mush in her jaw.
Voraj makes out Mermix's hair and Weylin's massive backpack out amidst the people lying down.
Across the room , there's a slew of corpses of people caught in the initial explosion, and the first wave of fire by the soldiers.
The Maw glances at Raros, doesn't recognize him, then points the soldiers in his direction.
In the artifact section, there's another group of soldiers, headed by a shirtless man, with spines in rows along his back.
[Team turn!]
Voraj bursts into the main hall through the Plants section.
Kisket gets hit in the eye, the chest, twice in the stomach, and the hip.
"Ok."
"Shanta, want me to shoot?" Peri asks.
"Shanta, want me to shoot?"
"Hey guys..." Peri frowns. "You made it in time for the party."
their faces aren't visible.
There's a group of 8 men by the front entrance dressed in black body armor.
Cause uh, there's a big ship and people with guns.
So we've got to get to the main entrance.
That's a good reason.
"Cause there's a big fuck off ship that just landed in the fuckin courtyard entrance and the people getting off it have guns."
"Actually how about you guys come here?"
"Oh I'm uh, pretty sure I took a wrong turn... I ended up heading into a tunnel and I ended up at the main entrance."
Hey, Peri, where the hell are you?
Kisket doesn't notice Peri's absence.
Kisket doesn't notice Peri's abscence.
Okay, I'm coming.
"Hey, where are you going?" Kisket's voice calls over the radio.
From the ground, there's a very clear trail that hooks around a thick tree and heads onward toward the Arts section.
It's a pretty long drop.
It's a pretty long drop
I'll follow you guys down if you take too long I guess.
I don't know if that's a bad thing or not.
You're not physically revolted... Did you not find them?
It's perfectly still.
She can't seem to find any sign of people.
It seems pretty empty.
Yeah that's a little weird.
Yeah that's a little weird
Like 6 minutes?
We're not like.
We're waiting up here.
Where's Voraj though?
Where's Voraj though.
Mermix's shirt?
She doesn't spot Mermix, but she does notice a blue shirt and a bra hanging from one of the trees in the middle of the garden between two paths.
She doesn't spot Mermix, but she does notice a blue shirt and a bra hanging from one of the trees in the middle of the garden between a few main paths.
He gets the feeling they aren't on the normal paths though.
Shanta's path loops back toward the tree they're in, while Voraj's leads to another fork.
They're both on separate paths, and Voraj has a sizable lead on Shanta.
There's a little platform connected to the trunk of a large tree in the center of the garden. 
The path they're on curves onto a bridge that heads above the trees.
It's been a little while now.
Once again there's a path to the left and to the right.
"Oh. Great." Peri sighs.
"Yeah dude! Lets go right now!
"Ways, we gotta hit up the fuckin place where they have those sick ass screen vids while we're riding this wave."
"Thank you little magical gecko."
"You were totally right!"
"What!"
"Shit bro, can you do the head talk thing and tell me what I'm thinking right now?" Mermix asks.
"Shit bro, can you do the head talk thing and tell me what I'm thinking right now?" Mermix asks?
"Woah. are you one of the little scaly aliens that can talk with their heads and stuff?" Mermix asks.
"Ah! What the hell!"
"Little dudette?"
"Duderella?"
"What about you my dudeness?"
"Want one?"
"Oh hey," Mermix says, "What's up?"
They're about fifty feet ahead and to the right of them.
They're about fifty feet ahead and to the right of them
There's a long snake-skeleton hanging along the ceiling.
Kisket starts sweating on Raros' shoulders.
She's light as fuck.
Kisket awkwardly climbs onto Raros's shoulders.
Um, yeah I think the headphones will work.
But I've got oxium now. So I'm a little scared of what that might do.
This crowd isn't like huge or anything, but there's a lot of fucking people in there.
I've got enochlophobia, okay? Fear of large crowds.
She's feeling pretty uncomfortable with that whole idea.
Kisket doesn't really want to push through the crowd.
"He was just some poacher who realized ahmkara hunting is a really fun sport."
"The whole thing about him being a pirate hunter, and killing a whole bunch of lords."
"People are so gullible, if they believe any of that crap."
"Oh.... It's the Hojart guy from the movie."
"And you're uh... not supposed to touch the statues."
"I just came here with my son cause we saw that movie."
"
"Uh, no."
The dude next to him-a heavyset purple alien with a double chin, gives Raros a dirty look.
Kisket glances at most of them, staving off a little bit of boredom.
[Comission 68: Anthology of a Psychopath.]
Ah... Should we follow them?
They land at Phora's Well and head into the museum.
They land at Phora's well and head into the museum.
"He's really good at pillow fort making." She says.
Mermix starts draping sheets over the seatbacks and securing them in place with rubber bands.
"And then me and my super hot girlfriend are gonna join the super mile high club."
"And then I'm gonna get stoned to shit."
"I plan on building a pillow fort up in this bitch." Mermix grins.
"I plan on building a pillow fort up in this bitch.
Mermix finishes pulling rubber bands off the bundle. It's just sheets.
"But."
"I don't know about you guys."
"Like."
"Listen."
She tosses Mermix a bundle that's been wrapped in rubber bands.
Weylin pulls a massive Ziploc bag of weed out of her day bag.
"Fuck yeah it's nice. Lets start the fucking party."
"Alright, I paid the dude three big bones and gave him ten tabs of fadeaway, but he's agreed to turn off the recording and cameras in this room for the rest of the flight."
Siscal nods. "Thanks."
"We'll keep her away from nuts." Kisket says.
"We'll keep her away from nuts."
"Four-really?"
"Listen. Um. I should have mentioned this earlier. The girl Weylin has. Like fourteen distinct mental disorders, but she's really sweet. Just don't let her eat any tree nuts please?"
Weylin grabs Mermix's hand and heads into the transport ship.
"Anyway lets get this shit on the popper. I want to try to see as many of those history bones as possible before the shit hits the fan and I die horribly." Mermix grins.
"Anyway lets get this shit on the popper. I want to try to see as many of those history bones as possible before the shit hits the fan and I die horribly."
"Yeah man, and I'm also Mermix."
Mermix smiles. "Bros, I'm like mega thankful for everything you're doing here today, even though I don't really know what it is. And Sis tells me I was acting a bigass fool yesterday and I apologize for that shit cause I know nobody wants to be acted a fool at."
"Nice to meet you though!" Weylin smiles.
"Knight Errant, Weylin Thasus, at your service." The striped girl offers a half curtsey. "Or, are you at mine? I'm not sure how this VIP, body guard thing goes. Usually we're the ones doing all the guarding."
The girl with the stripes notices everyone first. She raises a hand. "Helloo!"
Mermix, Siscal and a girl that's covered in stripes, are on the docks.
They meet up the next day on Taragon's Rock.
"Okay.... Good plan, honestly. I think. It'd get pretty weird for you." Siscal sighs.
"If you want to meet there tomorrow, Mermix and Weylin will be there at noon. If you want to like come here and ride with them, I guess you could do that too, but the point where his power says he'll die should be somewhere between 2pm and 4:30..."
"If you want to meet there tomorrow, Mermix and Weylin will be there at noon. If you want to like come here and ride with them, I guess you could do that too, but the point where his power says he'll die should be somewhere between 2pm and 4:30...
"So I'll give you the address to the museum. I went ahead and bought you passes online after you said you guys were coming." Siscal says.
"So I'll give you the address to the museum. I went ahead and bought you passes online after you said you guys were coming."
"Okay."
She double checks Mermix is asleep. Then checks the other two rooms, just to make sure nothing's on fire.
"He's a piece of shit. But he's the only piece of shit I have."
"Just, don't let him die, okay? That's all I'm asking."
"Yeah. I know the feeling."
"HOW'S THAT EVEN HAPPEN TO A MOTHERFUCKER?"
"I die of brain drowning. BRAIN DROWNING."
"I saw it." He says. "Sis told me not to use the oxium until later, but I lied and did it anyway. I get shot, de-limbed, scalped, then someone puts their dick in my brain and pees in it until my brain drowns."
"Yeah, sorry... He's not always like this."
"Uh."
"Didn't say that either."
"No you said you'd get the foolios from Monad and that they'd hook me up on some oxium, and I'd never feel anything ever again."
"I didn't say that Mermix."
Mermix looks at the ceiling. "You said.... You said you were gonna call the space cowboys and get Thomas Macreedy to sign my neck before I die."
"These are the bounty hunters I was telling you about, Mermix. The ones that would help keep you safe tomorrow?"
Qitata whispers into Kisket's ear again, and Kisket leans back over to Shanta.
Qitara says that's a whole loaf of bread. And also that she wants to leave.
Kisket whispers to Shanta.
Mermix sways a bit.
"Guys I dropped my loafer. Shit!"
"Sis, you can't just bust all up into a dude's sacred box, man. Now I've gotta light incense to purge all the tainted air you just let in, yo." Mermix says.
"Sis, you can't just bust all up into a dude's sacred box, man. Now I've gotta light incense to purge all the tainted air you just let in, yo."
Peri's seen worse.
Mermix comes out of one of the two connecting rooms. He's wearing a pair of oven mitts and holding a tray with a black cube on it.
There's a few large couches on either side of the room.
It smells like a ludicrous mixture of weed, cigarette smoke, strawberry-chamomile hookah, and various flavors of vape. There's a faint undertone of burnt bread to the mixture.
They enter Mermix's apartment.
"What the fuck," Kisket whispers to Shanta.
"Shit! Sis!" Mermix coughs. "Fuckin' close the door. You're ball busting my hotbox flow!"
They reach Mermix's door.
"I'm hoping that having you guys go with them tomorrow will change things, I guess." Siscal shrugs.
"I'm hoping that having you guys go with them tomorrow will change things, I guess."
"He's had this plan with his girlfriend to go to a museum in Phora's Well for months now, and now they're both depressed and when they get depressed they start dropping way too many tabs of acid. And it gets so fucking annoying and terrible and... yeah."
"So normally I wouldn't be worried. Like I'd just assume that they'd be drafting up a formal mission statement for him, and his power is taking that into account. But there aren't any missions being drafted, and tomorrow is his day off." Siscal frowns. 
"So normally I wouldn't be worried. Like I'd just assume that they'd be drafting up a formal mission statement for him, and his power is taking that into account. But there aren't any missions being drafted, and tomorrow is his day off.
"And normally things get changed and with a bit of luck Mermix makes it out of these deployments mostly unscathed."
"It's why he gets promotions in the first place. Just being given mission statements that put him in combat is often enough to let command know whether or not we'll win or lose in certain scenarios." Siscal frowns.
"Okay." She says.  "Mermix's oxium lets him know when he's going to die up to 48 hours before it happens. I think he got the alarm 16 hours ago? I'm not too sure. It was the middle of the night and he didn't tell anyone until this morning."
"So, do you guys want me to give you the rundown first? I don't know how well Mermix will be able to like, fill you in."
She starts heading toward Mermix's quarters. She leads them around the large outdoor courtyard.
"O-okay."
"This isn't mission related, so It's coming right out of my pay stub... Who do I make out the credit transfer to?" Siscal asks.
"So like."
"So like. "
"So like. 
"Hey guys!" Siscal waves. "Thanks so much for coming, Shanta."
Siscal is waiting outside for them. She's tapping her foot, nervously.
They reach the dock Taragon's Rock and exit the ship.
They reach the dock Targon's Rock and exit the ship.
Do we know the details on what we're gonna be doing?
"I've definitely heard the chanting." Qitara nods.
"I guess."
"That's cool..."
"Huh."
"I'm lost. Who's Voracious? He lives with you guys?" Peri frowns. 
I think it's been almost three weeks since the last time I even saw Voracious's door open.
I'm still sort of upset that I was the last to find out about this whole thing.
They pile into Krayna's shuttle.
"Right, uh. This is a little confidential." She inhales. "My brother Mermix has an oxium power that tells him uh, when he's going to die, basically, and it's going off. And it's really bad."
"Hey, It's me, Siscal... I've got a big problem."
"Hey, It's me, Siscal, I've got a big problem."
"Hey, is this Shanta? Uh, from Team Shanta?"
Mav's armor explodes with 80 pounds worth of C4.
She grabs hold of it's fleshy bits.
"GIMME THE RAPTOR."
"Give me permission to take out that fucking robot cunt." Mav shouts.
"DEL."
"AAH!" Cecelia shouts.
"AAH!"
[Cece switches the gun to explosive mode and rolls a 19 to hit the closest raptor.]
[Mav rolls a 10/12 for Dex.]
"Shut the FUCK up DELANO."
"Fucking all of them!!!"
"Fucking all of them
"Del call the fucking snipers! And someone shoot the fucking flares."
"Amir!" Mav covers her ears. "What the fuck did you do to this thing?"
[Mav rolls a 19 to shoot it.]
[Mav rolls an 8 to shoot the robot.]
[Mav rolls an 8 to shoot the robot,]
"What the fuck that's gross!" Cece shouts.
"WAIT!" Cecelia shouts. "Aah!"
"WAIT"
She drops her gun out the car window.
Mav looks out the front of the van.
"Why's he mad?"
[Mav rolls a 9 for dex to climb over Rah Rah.]
Jan climbs most of the way up the stairs and crouches with her rifle over the edge.
Condor Blue shouts. "OH GOD NO NO NO NO."
She's fuming.
[Jannessen rolls a 12/16 to shoot hydrin]
"Oh God!!!" Porcea shouts.
[Jan rolls a 6/7 for acrobatics.]
Wrought doesn't realize he's being spoken to.
"Alright."
Condor Blue dips his head. "Ma'am."
"Oh shit! Shit shit shit...." Ceci frowns and tries again.
[Porcea rolls a 10/16 for acrobatics.]
[Cecelia rolls a 14/16 for detection.]
Mav looks vaguely disappointed with the entire situation..
Mav looks vaguely disappointed with the entire situation.. 
"Ariso, is there anything you could do to the trucks?"
[Mav rolls a 5/16 to resist.]
"Look for rope to hold the steering wheel in place.
"We're gonna have to lose one of the cars." Mav frowns.
She tries to climb into the driver's seat.
Cecelia rolls a [7/7] Str to push Rah Rah out of the way.
"Oh my fUCKING GOD!" Cecelia shouts.
"Oh my fUCKING GOD!"
[Jannessen rolls a 3/16 to shoot Amir.]
"Dir, get behind Amir's truck." Porcea says.
"Fuelia, get behind" Amir's truck." Porcea says.
"Shit!"
"There are just three cars, Del. That middle one looks like a transport truck, though." Mav says.
"There are just three cars, Del. That middle one looks like a transport truck, though."
[Oscar rolls a 12/15 to hit the middle right mortar.]
"Ah! What the fuck was that?" Cecelia grimaces.
She begins to pound on Amir's seat. "MORTARS, SHIT! DRIVE FASTER!!!"
"Mines." Mav says.
Del's truck goes first, Fuelia's goes second, and Rah Rah's goes third.
"Lets get back to the ship. Lenvu should be heating up some coffee for us."
"We'll have you fly into the Precipice, cut straight through their defenses, kill Kaiden Trazch, and steal as much information as possible."
"We'll have you fly into the Precipice, cut straight through their defenses, kill Kaiden Trazech, and steal as much information as possible."
"I wouldn't offer it to you if I didn't think you had it in you. You've got the sort of character for it."
"In a few weeks, depending on how soon The Justiczar okays my proposition, I may have a mission for you two to lead."
"Excellent. I was hoping you might say that."
"What about you two?"
"I've always liked the notion of not giving pirates what they want."
"I'
"Which means there's something on the Precipice that she wants."
"They most likely work for Lady Wolf."
"I'd thought they'd had ties to pirates, but now I'm absolutely certain about it."
"They're a small group of bounty hunters called The Chosen. Led by an apex terogoid that goes by Idrethal.
"They're a small group of bounty hunters called the Chosen. Led by an apex terogoid that goes by Idrethal.
"Really. That was them?" Zacht turns.
"What about those terogoids. Did you recognize them?"
"But nobody contacts Sen. And Sen doesn't contact anyone. So that's the first big red flag."
"Lady Wolf hasn't moved for a long time. She deals almost entirely in information, and her dealings are generally legal, by Monad standards. So a government official having connections to her would, while regrettable, not be all that surprising."
Then there are others, still known, but low priority, due to their inactivity. Sen of Akashia and Lady Wolf come to mind."
"There are several, not all of them are known. Ludovica, obviously, The Agean Vapor, Aphodii Kaz-a Tyra, Vox Mortis, The Maw, for example.
We haven't had to deal with them, sir, just Ludovica and Horror Squad.
"There isn't a wrong answer. I'm just interested in how informed you're being kept."
"There isn't a wrong answer. I'm just interested in how informed you're being kept.'
"Agustin, what do you know about the Pirate Lords?"
"Agustin, what do you know about the Pirate Lords?'
"Alright, lets head home."
"There's traces of oxium in it. But I can't be too sure what it does just yet."
"There's traces of oxium in it. But I can't be too sure what it does just yet.
"Lets see that chip."
"There's a few interesting contacts in here. Lady Wolf I can understand, but Sen of Akashia. That's unexpected."
"Put it in that, we'll have it scanned back at the godhead."
Using a bit of his oxium he extracts the chip without damaging it.
"Yes, please do." Zacht says. He continues looking through her phone.
That's not big at all.
It's a small incision on her right side that looks laser sealed.
"Beneath the clothing."
"Beneath the clothing.
"No, I meant in her, like an implant."
"That pirate wanted something in her. Can you help me search for it?"
"Would you two come help me out here?"
"Would you two come help me out here?
"Well fucking done."
The Zachthazel claps a hand on Uti's shoulder.
There's a hole in the wall where the other one once was.
He's glowing bright yellow.
Idrethal's helmet takes the full force of the spike slap and he's thrown into the wall
He hops through.
"Alright?"
Zacht says. "Listen, when he bends down to pick that woman up, you're going to move in. They'll kill all my associates here, and we'll kill all of them as they do so."
"Nice entry, right on cue."
"Nice entry, right on cue"
"Nice entry, right on cu."
"Nice entry, right on ce."
The big white one's helmet has a mane of canisters that stick out behind his head.
They all have long helmets that point out like they're accommodating for snouts.
"Extra points for that."
"Nice entry, right on que."
"Don't fucking move a fucking muscle." The short one says. "We've already disabled all the respawners in here and in your ships, and I swear to fuck, we'll blow the fucking brains out of everyone here!"
He hasn't gotten out of the chair.
"Streaming." He says, "Not recording."
"1."
"2."
It says, "3."
A message appears in Uti and Mars' helmets.
"There we are."
The other people around the table jump.
"There we are."
The man whispers into the woman's ear.
"Right now," Zacht says, "one of you is recording this meeting, with the intent of selling the recording."
"Right now, one of you is recording this meeting, with the intent of selling the recording."
The woman from the couple that walked in last takes the man's hand.
"I don't care who's fault it isn't. All of you are being held accountable." He says, quietly. "The decision is already made, and you'll receive notice of how much you're expected to contribute tomorrow morning. Right now there's another matter we need to consider."
Zacht doesn't respond to any of this.
Left and right, people shout, "Actually, I was forced into it by Embargo! They've been holding my children hostage!" "I was gonna report it, but Suriyah blackmailed me!" "I would have told you in person, if Compa hadn't bought me out!"
"So I'll require all of you to sponsor a mission by Monad to assassinate Kaiden Trazech, and put one of our own in charge of Precipice operations."
"Fine." He says. "Well. If it matters that much to you all, then so be it. The fact remains, Monad can't have The Precipice selling to GP."
"So yea, we did let Sekko Corp crash and burn. Fuck Sekko and fuck Luden. I'm glad he's dead."
"I remember when Tersicore was king of the weapons manufacturing industry. Those were the glory days. I think I speak for everyone when I say we want those days back."
"Go on." Zacht says.
"I think I speak for everyone when I say we're sick of Sekko Corp's superiority in the weapon's trade. So when we saw what was going on, we took the opportunity to bring things back to the they used to be."
He stands in all his three-armed glory and says. "Yes, Councilor, that is exactly what we were thinking."
One person, closer to the back stands up. He's a big furry alien, the same species as Auto, only one of his arms has been replaced by a pair of two prosthetic ones.
"I get it. Business, you all thought, 'Oh, If we sell Monad our stockpile of Sekko weapons, they won't notice that Kaiden fucking Trazch's running that company into the ground selling exclusively to rebels and pirates! Yes we're a bunch of little devious fucking geniuses, aren't we?'"
"I get it. Business, you all thought, oh, If we sell Monad our stockpile of Sekko weapons, they won't notice that Kaiden fucking Trazch's running that company into the ground selling exclusively to rebels and pirates! Yes we're a bunch of little devious fucking geniuses, aren't we?"
"And why didn't anyone report it for six and a half fucking months?"
"So!" Zacht says. "The Precipice. What in the world happened there?"
The Zachthazel doesn't respond.
The guy Compa balks. "Oh, Councilor Ze-yein, didn't see you arrive."
The guy Compa balks. "Oh, Councilor Ze-yein, didn't see you arrive.
"That's why we voted to shut down your project."
"Your escapee became a pirate lord, Compa."
"-all I'm saying is that why the fuck does Suriyah's company get to make her oxium implanted fucking psionic super commandos and cut people open for shits and giggles, while my Man o' War project gets one escapee, and gets shut down. Fucking branded as unethical? What the fuck is that shit?"
Mars sits down next to Uti's blood pool and listens as well.
There's a large group of people sitting along a table.
It's a very good thing the carpets are already red.
"What the fu?"
The dude doesn't notice.
"O fucking k."
"Yes. Cool."
"What's over there?" Mars whispers.
There's someone in a suit walking away from the door. He's wearing a bulletproof vest and has a gun strapped to his hip.
The hallway continues, only there's a glass door to the left here that doesn't seem to lead anywhere, at least anywhere he can see from his vantage on the ground.
It's locked.
The hallway turns left here, and there's another window before the turn.
The hallway turns again here, and there's another window before the turn.
The room is well lit, and there's a deep red rug on the ground.
They're in a hallway. There's a window to their left.
They're in a hallway There's a window to their left.
There's nobody on the other side.
He see's one of Ui's blood eyeballs on the ledge next to him.
He sees a man and a woman in expensive clothes. They don't have any weapons or anything. They're probably just here for the meeting.
"I can probably get us through either."
Mars frowns, "Window or wall?"
There are also some on the bottom floor, but those don't really seem like a good idea.
So we're gonna have to get in there.
There's a walkway that runs around either side of the house.
He doesn't find anything.
A man in a suit steps out. His face is like burnished steel, and all hard edges. He shakes Zacht's hand and claps him on the back, before standing aside to let him in. 
Zacht doesn't answer that one.
"On the bright side, New Avalon sent a few troops to establish their presence in the matter."
"I'm going to be meeting with some less desirabe people, and they all believe I'm coming alone.
"Good."
"You understand?"
"I need you to stay out of sight, but remain within reach."
"Well I suppose that's useful.
"Huh."
"What are your types."
"I mean types."
"Oxium?"
We've been in a couple dangerous situations...
"I got a chance to briefly read your files last night, but I never finished."
"I got a chance to briefly read your files last night, but I never finished.
"So what sort of experience do you have?
The Zachthazel begins talking, it's hard to tell at first if he's talking to himself or to Uti and Mars.
Through the gate, there's a long winding road that leads  up a hill toward a three story house.
[ Commission 66: Wrong Place, Wrong Time ]
"There we are."
"Any second now." Zacht checks his watch.
They catch up with him. He's stopped at the gate, staring up at one of the metal bars as it rises about 25 feet into the air.
If we get left behind again I think Ar-khan'd have me thrown out into space or something.
C'mon.
It's night time here. Probably early evening.
It's night time there. Probably early evening.
And then we'll be spending six and a half hours entrenched in the deepest shit ever, with that guy.
Everything goes well, and we stand around doing nothing for six and a half hours, or it doesn't.
The Zachthazel doesn't keep any personal mementos inside of his ship, the seats are white leather, the walls are genuine wood, and the floors and ceiling are a heavily stained plexisteel polymer.
... He's got a driver...
Zacht takes a seat in the copilot's chair. He leans over to say something quietly to the pilot.
"Well, lets not waste any more time. Punctuality is key here."
"The Zachthazel." He says, stretching out an arm. "You two are reticle's Agustin Azulay and Mars Speaks?"
"You're a little late."
It's 8:01 in the morning
Mars and Uti meet the Zachthazel in front of his personal ship. They're fully geared up for a mission. The Zachthazel is checking his watch.
He's getting his measurements done by an armorsmith on Tersicore.
"See you soon." Lady Wolf says, warmly.
"Alright."
"Acropos, dear, we're heading home. If you would please make your way back to the ship."
Veruvi watches the mask bow it's head in response.
"Absolutely."
Yeah. I'll take it. Sh9uld help with the uh, "sh9w 9f f9rce," 6it 9f the meeting.
On the fourth toss, it doesn't come back down.
G99d.
G99d.
"G99d."
"She's locked in a cell on Ipo-Rakaikon, surrounded by people she spent most of her life killing. She doesn't need it anymore. So we relieved her of it."
"It was your mother's."
"It was your mothers."
He pulls out a white sphere and drops it into Veruvi's outstretched hand. 
"Hold out your hand." Lady Wolf urges.
She doesn't click on anyone.
"Excellent!" Lady Wolf says.
"I already came all this way. I'd rather have you look at it first, before you decide you don't want it."
"Acropos has it. He's in the shuttle now, heading your way."
"My husband dropped something off with me that he thought you might want. He's busy right now, so he asked me to bring it the rest of the way."
Well it's w9rking. I'll 6e fine th9ugh. Why'd y9u c9me all the way 9ut here?
Lady Wolf nods, slowly. "I think it's something of a test..."
"Hello." She says. "How are you doing?"
The eyes on Lady Wolf's otherwise impassive mask seem to light up.
Veruvi smiles, "Hey."
From the ship's bowels, another ship, looking a bit like a fly in comparison, drops out and begins heading toward her.
There's the chime of a notification on the map.
If she were to walk up to the window, she'd see a massive red-blue planet suspended below her. It's pretty, but she's already looked at it for hours.
She's way, way outside of Monad space. It took her six long jumps to get here from the outskirts of Zenithon, and the stops were just to make sure the ship was headed the right way.
so what's the plan for her? are you gonna replace borealis with her when you take out monad?
nah it's all good.
polya's got raros on a leash.
if anyone it's polya
it's me.
who's the unofficial leader of team shanta?
hey uh, ogg, what's raros doing right now?
i'll ask
Don't ask then.
Ask if it's Elise?
EAT.
EAT.
No.
Grab the person's face.
Go left.
Don't answer.
Keep a hand on the girl. Make sure she's safe.
Leave.
Turn around.
Say, "Take her."
Say, "Take her"
Rip it open.
Doesn't matter.
Don't drop the girl.
Eat the grass. Eat the meat.
Reach into the dog's stomach and pull.
Crawl over the beetles to the dog.
Too bad.
That is.
it'll map a 3d model of the cave.
You're dead?
That's...
She seemed pretty upset that she'd never been able to see herself.
Well Shanta's looking at you.
Can you see what Shanta's seeing right now?
She says she's trapped.
We're gonna help this girl.
I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
What's your name?
Hello.
right! jesus christ, i'm sorry.
listen, i don't know what's up with me. what's your name again?
lot of guests tonight.
delicious, isn't it?
Mars tries to cut off Sacrael's fingers.
[Mars rolls a 9 to slide under the table.]
Mars decides to cut his shirt where Sacrael grabbed it.
Mars cuts Sacrael's arm with the glass.
Who's Elise?
[Comission 64: We lost our Haven, COMPLETE!]
[Comission 63: We lost our Haven, COMPLETE!]
"How long have I been on the floor?"
"Yeah."
"Yeah. Uh."
She turns and winces at Uti. She mouths "I'm sorry."
She tuns and winces at Uti. She mouths "I'm sorry."
&gt;Did you kill any of the guards?&lt;
&gt;We've got everything we need Suz.&lt;
&gt;Good.&lt;
&gt;Nothing to say?&lt;
&gt;It's always been that way.&lt;
&gt;Haven can do anything she damn well pleases.&lt;
&gt;Yes she can.&lt;
"I uh."
"What the fuck..."
&gt;Lets go.&lt;
Neon takes Sirie's hand off her cheek and pulls it.
One of Neon's eyes cracks open.
&gt;Not at all.&lt;
"I was really different back then... It sounds like she hasn't changed much, though..."
"You acted like you've seen her before?" 
"I thought she'd died. I don't know what's doing on."
"A couple hundred years ago..."
"We were in a relationship...."
"This... Is Mizerkah."
"Sure."
"Um."
"Actually, I don't really think I can."
"............."
"...."
"I can explain."
"I can explain."
Neon's eyes are closed.
He's still K/O'ed
Franklin's breathing levels.
But it's shallow.
In the doorway, Sirie is holding Neon's face.
Uti notices a stream of blood coming from Mars' nose as well.
Uti notices a stream of blood coming from Mars' nose as well
Uti shakes off most of the pain.
He can make out the word they're screaming.
Look she's fuckin losing it or something.
I didn't think we could actually take him.
They're in the opposite direction of the storage building.
"And the floors in this building are tall as shit."
"We just," She wheezes "Fucking chased her down like three flights of stairs at light speed."
Neon doesn't respond.
Neon's head shaking grows a little more vigorous.
Neon's head shaking grows a little more vigorus.
Neon can't respond.
&gt;I. Uh.... I can't...&lt;
&gt;N-uh. Not right now.&lt;
&gt;N-uh. Not right now.
She looks at Uti's face. Then at Mars.
There's someone in the door.
"Hopefully," The guard agrees.
"Hopefully." Sirie says.
"Yeah nice seeing you."
"Goddammit."
And he's got a shitty hand.
He draws two cards and puts one down. A yellow 2.
It's uti's turn.
"And you were shit talking not two seconds ago?" Sirie shakes her head. "I can't believe you."
"Rules are whoever says it first."
"Draw a fuckin card, baby. I'm the king of this game."
"Uno!" The guard shouts.
"U-"
Sirie puts down a yellow 6, she's got one card.
It's Sirie's turn, then the guard's, then his, then Mars'
You don't wanna finish the game?
"All clear."
"See?" The guard says.
&gt;Definitely.&lt;
"That good enough?"
Neon's eye glows green.
All the screens in the building now show Neon's eye.
She aims it at Neon's eye.
She looks like she's some combination of furious and ecstatic.
&gt;Alright, I'm ready.&lt;
&gt;I'm not acting weird.&lt;
&gt;I'm. Not acting weird.&lt;
&gt;Okay?&lt;
&gt;I'm asking the same question.&lt;
Neon doesn't answer that.
&gt;I'm ready.&lt;
&gt;I'
"Neon you ready?"
"Done."
He checks all the screens. This is the only one where he can see the woman's face.
Neon's staring very intensely at the screen.
They look like they're just talking.
There's two guys, one with blond hair and one with curly hair, a woman with long white hair, and a prison guard, all sitting at a table.
The camera's pretty grainy.
She doesn't say anything.
&gt;You done yet, Tobin?&lt;
&gt;Or that you like to do nothing, for fun?&lt;
&gt;You mean you don't like anything?&lt;
&gt;Like for fun?&lt;
&gt;Susett, what do you like to do?&lt;
&gt;Okay.&lt;
&gt;She'll do her thing, you wanna check the rest of the rooms and come back? Or just wait?
&gt;Yeah, thanks.&lt;
Tobin's already at the computer, clacking away.
On the desk there's also a detailed map of the prison.
It comes off it's hinges, twists, and the edge hits a dude who's sleeping in a chair.
Neon notices how far they've gone and begins to follow.
Considering that all the prisoner's cells are on this side of the door.
Pretty weird that they'd do that.
It's locked.
There's a metallic clank that rings through the cells.
Across the room there's a door like the one below.
She can't quite process what just happened to her.
Zazani's mouth drops open.
Zazani's mouth dropps open.
Right in Zazani's face.
Susett walks back over and jams the door into Zazani's door frame.
She doesn't say anything.
"They let Sirie out of her room not too long ago."
"Probably in a storage area. I don't really know where they'd keep our belongings."
She said it in Susett's head.
&gt;I think we're supposed to be stealing her stuff.&lt;
"Zazani Xhorin?"
"I'm Zazani."
"That room is my friend's," She says.
"Are you letting us out?"
"That room is my friend's."
It's a woman with dark hair, sort of lanky looking, but well built.
He rips it straight out of it's raising mechanism.
There's a tray next to the door as well.
In there there's a cup, half full of water on the toilet seat.
&gt;Nice.&lt;
&gt;Why not like, pull on it?&lt;
&gt;I think you just punched a bendable metal bar.&lt;
There's another metal door like the one on the floor below along the same wall as them.
There's a barred door across the room from them labeled "SOLITARY."
&gt;Why don't we just take those stairs and see what's on the second floor?&lt;
&gt;There are a lot.&lt;
Neon frowns.
&gt;Neon frowns.&lt;
&gt;I don't know what that means.&lt; Neon says in Susett's head.
They don't really know what to think.
But he doesn't stop until he's punched each lock.
There is now half a door between the guard locker room and the cells.
On the far side of this room, there's a metal door with a heavy bar running through both it and the wall it's attached to.
There's about 12 beds in each.
The two rooms look like they're bunks for the prison guards.
Both doors collide and the third door's handle snaps. The door swings open.
There's a prison guard in there. He's warming up a cup of coffee in a microwave.
She's still a little surprised.
Tobin watches. She knows she shouldn't be surprised.
"You want to go in there?"
There's a door to their left as well, and a hallway ahead of them.
The first is labeled Ground Floor , the second is labeled Containment 1, and the third is Containment 2
&gt;Cool.&lt;
&gt;So help us find a security room, okay?&lt;
&gt;Tobin and I have been working on a trick for something like this.&lt;
&gt;Hey Susett you wanna see something cool?&lt;
The door's sliding mechanism sparks pitifully.
"Doesn't sound impossible."
"And it'll be under Xhorin."
"So... The thing we're stealing is a personal item of one of the prisoners?" Tobin asks.
There's a stairwell entrance behind the ship, and a balcony to the left that drops to a lower roof.
"Okay."
"I just don't want any issues here, okay?"
"There isn't anything we can do about it from here anyway."
"Sometimes ships land up top, there's a ship pad up there."
"What do you mean, yeah right?" The guard heads over. "Listen dude. There's nothing to worry about. We get these sorts of things sometimes. Prison fights, break-out attempts. Just give it like fifteen, twenty minutes. The siren always turns off in like thirty seconds." 
"What do you mean, yeah right?" The guard heads over. "Listen dude. There's nothing to worry about we get these sorts of things sometimes. Prison fights, break-out attempts. Just give it like fifteen, twenty minutes. The siren always turns off in like thirty seconds." 
"The prison has an automatic lockdown system, Nothing's getting out or in until the situation is handled and the people up top give the 'all clear.'"
"Sir, please remain calm."
Sirie's eyebrows raise.
"Is this you?"
"I was, really surprised to hear about how Monad brought the two of you back to life... I'm glad they did though."
"Yeah."
"She really enjoyed hanging out with you two."
"Nice... It's probably weird say, but Veruvi used to talk about you and your sister a bunch."
"We haven't ever really talked, Uti, what's your story?"
"So...."
That's not the strangest thing I've heard all week.
The loud rumbling of a ship flying overhead stops Mars for a moment.
"Her mom."
Who's The Zazani chick?
"That's too bad."
"I see..."
It's been... a couple weeks since I last went to their base... but. She wasn't there last time...
It's been... a couple weeks since I last went to the base... but. She wasn't there last time...
"Have either of you heard from Veruvi?"
"Been better." She shrugs.
"Hi, Uti."
"How'd you find me?"
"Um." Sirie shakes her head. "Hi."
Sirie's wearing stiff khaki pants and a stiff khaki collared shirt.
He's very, very interested in it.
It's suddenly very interesting.
What're you looking at?
It's just sitting at the bottom of one of the bookshelves.
Uti notices one of those block jungle gym things that are sometimes in doctors or dentist's offices.
There's a TV on the wall opposite the one they enter through.
It looks like this may be the first time it's been used ever.
Neon takes off to grab Tobin and get a dropship.
&gt;Suzy and I get along.&lt;
&gt;Good.&lt;
"You shouldn't need more than a team three or four to breach it."
&gt;Very alright!&lt;
&gt;YES.&lt;
&gt;Yes, that's true.&lt;
&gt;She can fight.&lt;
&gt;Yeah she is!&lt;
&gt;Can I bring Tobin???&lt;
&gt;And can I go?&lt;
&gt;So, is there a mission or something?&lt;
Neon's tail begins to audibly slap the floor.
&gt;Ohhhhh.....&lt;
&gt;Can you do the thing where you scratch me between the ears?&lt;
&gt;I know.&lt;
&gt;When I'm thinking about people... or whatever...&lt;
&gt;Sometimes It just happens on it's own.&lt;
&gt;I know it's against the rules, and I am very sorry.&lt;
&gt;I heard it in your head.&lt;
She's sitting, wagging her tail really fast.
&gt;I heard my name.&lt;
"You shouldn't need more than a team of four to breach it."
"It's not very heavily guarded."
"The prison is secret, in a remote area of the planet." 
"It's being held in a prison on Ipo-Rakaikon."
"We'd like your help in retrieving one of the orbs."
He doesn't get paid enough to deal with this situation.
"Well... I'll open the gates for you. They're gonna have to hold onto your weapons up there."
"Uh."
"You guys have the visit scheduled with Prisoner H022?"
"It's all that was left in the break room."
"Uh." He checks the can. "Banana cream... I guess. It doesn't really taste like anything."
There's a guard at the gate checkpoint, he's sitting in a little checkpoint cubicle, eating a muffin and drinking some kind of soda.
There's a massive chain-link fence about fifty yards away.
We only learned afterward that the Umbran and his team got wiped out by Horror Squad.
So while they were distracted, I freed us and we escaped onto the dropship.
"What the fuck."
"Uhhhhhh....." Sasha frowns.
"Uhhhhhhh......"
"Uh."
Aradia's hands glow white and Neon feels a stirring in her stomach.  
They're both back alive.
Sasha rolls a [9] to use his Oxium.

&gt;Monad most likely in there.&lt; Neon says to Susett.
&gt;Hey. Asshole.&lt;
&gt;Okay.&lt;
&gt;I can host a link between everyone... but it gets loud.&lt;
Neon's eyes open wide.
&gt;What?&lt; Neon asks in Artifis' head.
&gt;He's either dead or unconscious.&lt;
&gt;I can't speak to him through the link.&lt;
&gt;That's not Czania on the radio.&lt;
That's not Czania on the radio.
&gt;Turn off the radios.&lt; Neon says in everyone's heads.
Neon speaks to Czania in his head. &gt;Czania. Nothing?&lt;
&gt;Czania you haven't heard any of this?&lt;
"Who?" Sasha asks, "Did you see?
&gt;Good.&lt;
&gt;Aw, I thought you'd finally gone and died on us.&lt;
Neon lifts her dog head off of Kate's lap.
"Where are the agents heading?" Sasha asks.
&gt;I don't know either. It just means more time I have to spend associating with the retard.&lt;
Czania doesn't get a response.
&gt;You aren't very much fun to talk to.&lt;
&gt;No.&lt;
&gt;No, only the bald asshole. Everyone else is perfectly fine.&lt;
&gt;How do you cope?&lt;
&gt;I don't know either. It just means more time I have to spend with the retard.&lt;
&gt;I don
&gt;I asked you a question, retard.&lt;
&gt;Hey retard.&lt;
&gt;What the fuck are you talking about, retard?&lt;
"Cool."
"Anything else we should know, Artifis?" She asks.
"Anything else we should know, Artifis?"
"Well shit."
"Do we know which Chromatin?" Sasha asks.
Not that there's anything wrong with you.
Frankly, I don't want to be anywhere near you.
NO I DIDN'T ACTUALLY
Isn't being a fucking crazy bastard his thing?

Then 2, one with him and one without, then release the fourth, make sure to leave that one empty.

&gt;Deeper.&lt;
&gt;Cares? Uti, big one. I've seen her before.... Eh bland. But she's cute. A little more than I'd prefer, but I can see the appeal.&lt;
&gt;Oh my, Mars, you smell like jealousy. Stinking hot envy just layered over everything. It's a little annoying. And Fear. I like that. Excitement, but. Not for your friend? Heh. And you called him a liar.&lt;
&gt;Susett gets to know everything because he's a brick wall. He's a sheet of metal, heh. I'm gonna push a little deeper now.&lt;
&gt;No, see, I can't look into her head. It's part of the game. I've gotta guess, and pick up the tidbits off others.&lt;
&gt;Surface thoughts not too useful.... Old information... You could practically taste the male in the air around her.&lt;
&gt;You've got a lot that I want right now, Mars Speaks.&lt;
&gt;Mars Speaks.&lt;
Mars stares blankly at the wall above Neon's shoulders.
He doesn't say anything.
This shit's way harder.
I know
I'll end you.
I'm only mad at me!
I said that I wouldn't be mad but I still am.
I swear on my mom's dead fucking body.
That I won't make any jokes.
I'm still mad.
His heart may be crushed for a while, but he apparently has balls made of fucking adamantium, so I'm sure he'll find someone.
And I'm not afraid to use it.
I've got terrible, terrible blackmail.
We're all adults here.
Okay. For Vica this time: how far have you let him go?
He's meeting you on his off days?
Don't look like that.
I'm just messing with you.
Don't even try to say that's not accurate.
That's accurate.
But he's like.
Oh my god that is where you went????
But I'm also like.
Oh my god I'm so fucking mad.
I mean look. I'm mad.
I'm not gonna attack my bro's potential girlfriend.
I'm not gonna attack my bro's potential girlfriend
There's no point.
Can you uncuff us now?
I know it's just for show.
I'M THE CALMEST I'VE EVER BEEN.
I've never been more calm in my entire fucking life.
I am calm.
I've got respawners.
Don't squeeze little boy.
AND IF YOU DON'T ANSWER
I'M ASKING THE QUESTIONS HERE.
YOU'RE DATING HIM?????
I'M SO FUCKING ANGRY.
A H H H H H H H H HH H  H H H H H H H H H H H H
HOT
FUCKING
SO
YOU'RE DATING THE FUCKING
YOU'RE DATING LUDOVICA
YOU'RE FUCKING DATING HER.
YOU'RE FUCKING DATING HER.
You're lying.
You're looking more focused than you have been in the past hour.
I didn't want to.
I'm sorry for that.
It's always about the stupid shit.
You're lying to me.
You're my best friend.
I don't like this.
There's nothing about you that seems even the slightest bit scared.
You're treating this whole situation like it's a joke.
He shakes his head.
She didn't ask you for your name.
Mars doesn't say anything.
I... still think you're lying. About something.
You didn't.
Mars is pretty much a geyser of sweat.
Mars's mouth opens.
He's beginning to look like he's really straining himself to sit still.
He's silent now.
With the guy who's going to break our legs.
But I think in this scenereo, It's a....
To be honest I don't talk very much at all.
I'm gonna at the VERY least get killed as pleasurably as possible.
But there's a slight possibilty of both.
I'm not confirming or denying that I'd enjoy it.
I'm....
And I don't wanna die.
And I know you've got the sword bitch who I dropped.
I know you've got the crazy serial killer bitch
I wouldn't say this in any other situation, cause like.
Uti doesn't know anything about what I'm about to say.
Now I'm serious.
At the very most, they MIGHT send the Disciplis.
That isn't all that obvious?
What if I'm specifically suggesting things that edge toward that kinky route?
I already lost an ear today, I'm not gunning for anything else.
I'll go ahead and start calling you "massa" whatever the fuck you're into.
DON'T
Really, you can just ask nicely I'll go ahead and tell you everything I know, lickety split!
I don't see the point in all that.
Or we tell her we're actually just dead weight and there's nobody coming because Arkhan really just sent us here to die like fuckin pigs.
We lie and don't die.
We've got two options here.
I don't see you helping!!!
I'm a pretty big deal back in Monad.
We're pretty big in Monad.
Yes ma'am, whatever you say.
My name's Mars Speaks.
I'm not waking up to that degrading bullshit.
Mars wakes up immediately, but doesn't say anything. Instead allowing himself to be shaken.
Mars doesn't teleport through the ground this time, at least.
Ow! That....
We're gonna take their shit.
If they're gonna lock us in here.
And get two?
But if they're different shapes...
Borealis, you're a girl.
That's NOT funny.
That's a thing!
That's a thing.
Wh-
I can't hear anything on my right side.
I'm takin this bitch out.
Don't tell me you do the arm-sword thing because you like killing people with your arm swords.
Don't tell me you do the arm-sword thing because you like killing people with your arm swords.
I get what he's going for.
She's a very intelligent, very real, and smart lady.
Don't call B a computer.
You're very tall, sir. And that in and of itself is incredibly intimidating.
[Comission 62: ToWtSKIHTM, Complete!]
Anyway, that's all I got.
I can at least flash my license to hook him up with some codeine or valium or something.
I can at least flash my license to hook him up with some codine or valium or something.
Yeah. I've really been uh.
Thanks, I'll run to the pharmacy and get him a refill if he needs it.
Speaking of Iri, how's Pringle?
that's fucking genius...
that's...
Iri definitely.
those powers do some fucked up shit to a person..
jesus.
and you didn't see her in that fight in front of her dad's tower.
You didn't see her in that fight in front of her dad's tower.
the next step is to go to the precipice and kick kaiden's ass right?
that's a lot of shit.
They didn't really talk about anything else. It was all vague. New recruits, tracking shipments, area control, vague estimates of patrol routes.
That'd be
That's really it.
Yvelte was sure that Kaiden wanted the Precipice so he could get access to those factories and Luden's designs.
I don't know.
He said, "It's the precipice part of Kaiden's Precipice."
He said "It's the precipice part of Kaiden's Precipice."
He said he's researching the Ozos II portal.
I don't know why you keep calling it your fault.
It really, really wasn't your fault.
You didn't kill her dad.
"I don't know," Kisket shrugs.
I don't know. Kisket shrugs.
I don't really know what they were talking about there.
And he said, "I think we should get that bitch Ludovica to get it for us." 
And he said, "I think we should get that bitch Ludovica to get it for them." 
Kaiden asked what Idrethal thought about the Zenithon core. And Idrethal started talking about the schematics of some building and how it didn't have any windows and only one entrance that he was able to scope out without some sort of drone.
Luden asked what Idrethal thought about the Zenithon core. And Idrethal started talking about the schematics of some building and how it didn't have any windows and only one entrance that he was able to scope out without some sort of drone.
Vasha had his computer open on the table, and I'm pretty sure he had Kaiden on a video call or something. He was talking, and it was pretty clearly his voice.
We couldn't see their faces or anything.
Kisket's on the couch. Tracy is in the chair across from her. She's typing up a second account of everything on her own phone to send along with the video.
so what'd you see?
She glances at Saime. Her eyes stay on Saime for a moment, to the point of almost looking like she'd zoned out, before they flick back to Shanta.
"Sounds like fun."
"And what about you Mr. Amphiron?"
"Nothing to lose, right?"
"Really? I'd complain a lot. I could picture myself doing something really stupid for money, like stripping, or joining one of those death pit arenas."
"Not nice at all."
"No... It's not."
"Oh." Saime's eyebrows raise.
"That sounds nice."
"None?"
"Hard on your family?"
"Huh. How was that?"
"Where are you from?"
"Uh." Saime looks over "What about you?"
Saime shrugs. "Yeah..."
"You know... I don't remember either." Saime frowns. "That's pretty bad isn't it."
"What? Uh, yeah. It's uh there. Still."
"It's like uh. A lot of people. Always a lot of people. Everyone was the same. Not that interesting. Not like space."
"It
"Yeah, well I lost it, after a while."
"England."
"Earth."
"Yeah?"
They're gone.
Qitara takes Kisket's hand. With her other arm, she pushes through the wall, flowing straight through. Kisket walks through with her.
"Sure. Fine."
"I did do half of the scouting for you."
"She can just come out and grab me."
"Can I come with too then?"
"She can take people with her?" Saime raises her eyebrows.
She's always been looking for information.
"No I like the idea." Qitara nods. "Even if we went through the front doors we could take them. They're positioned so that they'd surprise us by being up high rather than on the ground. But since we already know that..."
"But we can." Qitara says. "He's not wrong."
We didn't come to fight anyone.
"Corners are usually safe." Saime says.
"The corner I went through is safe."
"No. The ones on top are facing the center, and so are the guards at the front door. There are two at the back, looking outside."
"No. The ones on top are facing the center, and so are the guards at the front door. There are two at the back, looking outside.
"There are guards at either end, and there's some scaffolding along the ceiling that some guards are looking down from."
"There are guards at either end, and there's some scaffolding along the ceiling that some guards are looking down from.
"Alright."
"Alright.
"That looks pretty useful."
"Wow." Saime says. "So that was the oxium stuff."
"If you're fine with it, then."
"It just has to be one at a time."
"I can take you with me."
"It doesn't look like you trust her."
"Do we want to let this girl know about that though?"
"If I use my Oxium I can go straight through the wall."
"I can do it, but..." She looks Raros up and down. "I don't know, maybe you can too."
"The dock around the hangar doesn't reach all the way back there. We'd have to climb around the outside." Saime says.
Kisket looks at Shanta and Raros. "What do you guys think?"
"There's definitely people at the front door, but I don't know about the back."
"There's definitely people at the front door, but I don't know about the back hangar."
"The windows can all be opened, but I don't know how quietly." She shrugs.
Saime nods. "There are some windows on either side of the hangar, a glass sun roof on top, the hangar doors in the back, those are open, and then there's the front door and the garage door in front."
"Saime nods. There are some windows on either side of the hangar, a glass sun roof on top, the hangar doors in the back, those are open, and then there's the front door and the garage door in front.
"Something along those lines." Saime nods.
"I'm pretty sure you said," She clasps her hands in front of her chest. "'Yes, Saime, please, come help us with our sneaky stake out thing, you truly are the best, and most sneaky individual we've ever met, and we love you.'" 
"Nope. Pretty sure you didn't."
"Hey. Fancy seeing you guys here!" Saime grins.
I'd still say we shouldn't.
"Should we say hello?"
"Alright."
"Who is this you're talking about?"
That's not suspicious at all.
"What do you see?"
The person turns to face Raros in their loop. He can make out the face, skinny, feminine lips, blueish looking hair, mostly hidden by the hood and the fact that they're keeping out of the light of the street lamps.

The person turns to face them in their loop. He can make out the face, skinny, feminine lips, blueish looking hair, mostly hidden by the hood and the fact that they're keeping out of the light of the street lamps. 
There's one person in a black hoodie and blue jeans pacing in circles in front of it, on the sidewalk.
The street lights are the same, there aren't any cars in front.
Hangar 12 comes into view. There's nothing particularly special about it.
"If he doesn't want any advice it's fine."
"It wasn't very insulting. I have reasonably thick skin." Qitara smiles.
"I was not corny..."
"A what?"
"I think green, or an ocean blue would look great on you."
"Red is definitely not your color."
What does that even mean?
There's grey.
There's grey
It's late, and Kisket, Qitara, Raros, and Shanta are making their way to the address: Hangar 12 in the Colossus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yeah! Very nice meeting you." Saime says.
Well, Kisket stands. It's been nice seeing you Tobin. And meeting you...
Saime only had a straberry milkshake on her tray. She didn't even finish a third of it.
Tracy eats like its the last meal he'll ever have, as always.
We'll be fine.
"I'm super sneaky and quiet!" She says "I'm the best sneaker around."
"But that's sooooo booooring."
"We were going to be working on things tonight."
"No. What?" Tobin says
"No. what?"
"Can I come?" Saime asks.
There isn't a time on the paper. So. Tonight?
Saime shrugs. "Done."
"What kind of oxium stuff?" Saime asks.
I'll be careful. And Qitara is really sneaky with her Oxium stuff.
You don't have to come if you don't want to.
It's just an address.
"What's this all about?" Saime asks.
I'm gonna grab that piece of paper.
Kisket watches the snake pull an envelope out from his coat.
"Oh okay."
"Are you on a mission? Stalking the furry alien?" Saime covers her mouth "Oh no, I'm totally getting in the way, huh."
"What about you?" Saime asks. "Are you bounty hunters."
in tobin's new movie?
"Me? I'm an actor! Or, I'm going to be one pretty soon."
"Oooohh."
"Oooohh."
"Ooh, that's a tough looking alien."
"So what were you all staring at?" Saime cranes her neck to peer off where Kisket's still staring.
"Hey you guys, hi Tracy." She says. "Sorry. If she disturbed you."
"You know Tobin?" Saime grins. "That's cool! I thought I'd have to introduce you or something."
"I'm Saime, it's nice to meet you."
She's got tatoos that look like branches running down her arms. She smiles bright.
"What are you up to, fellow humans and strange accompanying amphiron?"
"Hey there!" She says.
She's staring at a table a few rows over.
yeah we've got to figure that one out.
what's not great about it?
i know it's a weird question. but like, it's good to touch base every once in a while eh?
how's everyone doing?
A few minutes later everyone else comes back.
I'm actually in the mood for something terrible for me.
I don't even remember what's good over here.
It's been a while since we've done something like this.
They all head out to the food court.
He backs up and heads toward Kisket's room.
i guess it's been a bit since we've hung out
He heads over to Raros' room.
"Oh, alright." Eao smiles.
i was gonna go see what's up with.
"Sorry, what'd you say?"
Or wait, no it's not.
Right, yeah it's gonna be great.
That's a terrible idea.
And I'll tell you if I listened to it.
&gt;She's fun.&lt;
"Awesome!"
"Yes, ma'am, Queen."
"Well, actually. I could talk here for hours about what makes me a good candidate. But that wouldn't really prove anything, would it?"
"If I may, I'm currently a captain ma'am, my squad specializes in reconnaissance. I... Uh..."
&gt;Not very well...&lt; 
&gt;Ohhh. I guess she is. Huh.&lt;
&gt;Oh.&lt;
&gt;What the fuck is an understudy?&lt;
"Uh!" Lin gasps. "I'm sorry ma'am. Miss Neon told me to let her do all the talking."
&gt;I taught her myself!&lt;
&gt;And she's very smart.&lt;
&gt;She kills things.&lt;
&gt;I want her in the Horror Squad.&lt;
&gt;She's my first fan.&lt;
&gt;This is Lin-sho.&lt;
"You have this under control, Pringle, we believe in you."
Qitara grins and claps a tiny bit.
"Haha. Oh my, I'm very embarrassed and I don't quite know why."
"I missed didn't I."
"Hello Iri. We've all missed you very much."
"Wow."
"Where exactly?"
"Right here?!"
"Now I wish I brought candles."
"Do you need to call her soul from the ether? Can we set up a ritual of sorts?"
"That'd be difficult, wouldn't it?" Qitara frowns.
"Wonderful!"
"Did you get powers, Shanta?"
"Well, this is exciting."
"I apologize for that, but, uhm, how are the two of you today?"
"Kisket was out shopping, and I was looking around for people to interact with. Maybe my joining you was a little forced."
"Excellent!"
"Hello!"
That's crazy.
Then there's Raros.
I'm sure a few really weird people would be into Ohn.
And like.
I haven't checked cause like. Ew, gross.
I mean, I'm sure Cypress has a huge dick. If you're into that sort of thing.
We don't have much by way of like
Uh yeah.
I guess I'm really petty.
Do you think he's attractive?
He's probably worse than me.
He just doesn't really know... like how to act.
He's not thaat much of a scumbag.
Honestly I've never dated anyone before Qitara either.
That's almost unbelievable.
That's almost unbelievable
Wait really?
That's mostly it.
I don't think anything really changed between us except.
She's great.
Kisket doesn't really care too much about bright colors
Kisket doesn't really know what to say.
he's something.
he's
Tracy's hand flies to his face. He slaps himself with how hard he facepalms.
but i'm just kinda over it... now
like if she walked up to me right now and said "tracy be my fuckin boyfriend right fuckin now" i'd do it.
i don't think im into her anymore.
unless their names start with c and rhyme with eyepress
i'll get it.
and you'd like call anyone who did a fuckin idiot or something.
i mean no. i just thought you were the kind of guy who like wouldn't touch any social media ever
he can't hear us right now?
its sorta like he's your dog, except he can talk.
somehow it's like
i don't  know anymore...

{ Commission 60: The Fool - COMPLETE }
Veruvi goes straight to bed.
They return home without any fanfare, in a mood best described as "pretty fuckin' dull."
In an hour and a half, they reach Zenithon.
They enter the Ferry and take off.
Lady Wolf sees them over to the ferry and says a couple goodbyes.
They land and exit the ship.
6ut, thanks Shanta. Really.
Veruvi shrugs. "I just need a little time to think, I think."
Veruvi nods.
Uh. The sh9rt answer is n9. But the l9ng answer is... Maybe?
G99d questi9n.
And Lady W9lf's lost track 9f it herself, 6ut she guessed between f9ur and six hundred years?
L9nger than Lady W9lf by s9mewhere between twenty and a hundred years.
It's like... C9mplicated? I d9nt even really... Want t9 think a69ut it?

Like how Lady Wolf knows Sirie.
Like uhh.
Stuff.
"Like uhh."
Sirie's at ninety-six percent.
"Stuff."
Sirie's at 96%
We talked a 6it. Then they did the calculati9n thing. Then we talked s9me m9re.
Vervui thinks for a bit.
They fly down to a space station made of hundreds of rings in and around a spire.
The robot, Acropos, enters after Sirie and closes the doors.
Then Kisket, then Qitara, then Tracy and Cypress. Sirie is last on the ship.
"Gladly." LW says. "I'm sorry it wasn't on better terms."
Veruvi looks at Shanta, mouths, "everything's fine," then enters the ship.
Veruvi looks at Shanta, mouth's, "everything's fine," then enter's the ship.
The robot opens up the landing ship's doors and stands at attention.
"Ah, Acropos, if you would." Lady Wolf snaps as they enter the hangar.
The black robot is standing guard a little ways away.
Veruvi's waiting outside the landing ship.
They follow Lady Wolf to the hangar.
"Certainly!"
"Oh! She's at the hangar, waiting for you all."
"Good news everyone, we've just about arrived!"
"I called ahead and ordered a ferry for you all, It will be waiting for you at the docks next to our landing."
Good news everyone, we've just about arrived.
Lady Wolf enters the room without Veruvi.
They fly for about an hour in total silence.
Sirie's sitting off the side of her chair looking at the floor.
Sirie's sitting in her chair looking at the floor.
They're left alone.
Veruvi and Lady Wolf leave the room, heading toward the elevator.
"Well, we'll be back shortly, then."
"Alright."
Cypress hasn't been paying attention at all.
Sirie doesn't say anything.
no.
Tracy frowns.
Kisket shakes her head, as does Qitara.
"Would any of you like to come to the lab with Veruvi and I?"
"Is anyone else interested?"
LW leans in closer to Veruvi. "I'm sure you're interested in seeing these results too. I was thinking of keeping it mostly private, but... Well how 'bout it?"
She takes a couple steps back and calls an attendant, who takes the bit of blood away.
"Thank you." LW nods.
Lady Wolf draws a tiny bit of blood and removes the needle. From her other pocket she unwraps a band-aid and places it over where she stuck the needle.
Sirie doesn't resist.
In one motion, LW draws a needle from her coat pocket, and sticks it carefully into Sirie's arm.
Sirie stands still.
LW gets uncomfortably close to her.
Sirie stands still.
LW takes a step toward Sirie.
"But that's nonsense! I'm absolutely sure she loves you tremendously!"
Veruvi gives the slightest of nods.
"I'm sure it'd be hard for anyone, to think someone they care about has lived for so long, and will continue to do so with or without them." LW says to Veruvi. "It makes your life seem rather inconsequential in comparison... Like you don't matter to them at all in comparison to how much they matter to you. Doesn't it?"
"Mm." LW folds her hands together.
"I've raised her since she was very young." Sirie says.
Veruvi nods.
"Are you and Sirie close, Veruvi?"
Sirie frowns hard.
Sirie frowns.
"Understandable, It's not something easy to bring up in normal conversation. Usually the next question is something along the lines of, 'Will you forget about me after I die?' To which the answer is generally, yes, yes I will."
I never knew a69ut that.
"Yes, of course."
And the same g9es for Sirie?
Veruvi swallows.
Lady Wolf thinks for a moment. "A few things.... Most important of which is... As long as someone doesn't kill me first, I'm going to live for a very, very long time."
82... That's high, right. What d9es that mean... In practice I guess.
Tracy frowns.
"I've got to know, actually."
"So it's just been nagging at me. I really want to know what Haven's looks like."
"I've got a percentage of 82." LW says.
"Nah-Rii average at about 23% Ahmkara themselves average at 30."
"The highest recorded percentage was 59% And that belonged to that emperor of theirs."
"As far as Blood Oxium Content goes, Ahmkara didn't push any normal beings past 60%."
"Good question!" LW says.
... wait why?
"A BOC test, I'm sure you all heard all about those inside Crotia."
Sirie narrows her eyes. "What kind of test?"
"Just Sirie."
"It's really just a test, that I've wanted to do for a while now. It doesn't even have to do with you all."
"All that said, now that you're all here, I do have one thing in mind."
LW claps.
"And miss the chance to get to know you, Shanta?" LW tilts her head to the right. "Why would I do that?"
"And miss the chance to get to know you Shanta?" LW tilts her head to the right. "Why would I do that?"
"Look, if I wanted to harm you I would have used the laser I destroyed your ship with. And I would have done it from the comfort of my room." She stretches her arms out palms up. "I wouldn't have come down to speak with you, and I certainly wouldn't have let you on my ship."
Lady wolf drums her fingers on her legs.
As does Kisket
But she relaxes a bit.
Veruvi frowns.
"I suppose though, I have to apologize for the inconvenience. Though I'd hope I was making up for it already."
"I suppose though, I have to apologize for the inconvenience. Though I'd hope I was making up for it."
"If you had been in any other ship I would have undoubtedly left you for dead on that planet."
"I'd thought my old ship was lost to space somewhere, but there it was, and in such marvelous condition.... I couldn't stand the sight of it!"
"Anyway. The ship, right. I'm sorry. I saw it parked there, and well," She laughs. "It made me incredibly angry!"
"It's been a while since I've seen this face though. I'll be honest, I miss it dearly." LW puts a hand on her neck and lets it run onto her shoulder. The two of them are about the same height, With Sirie being only a fraction taller.
Lady Wolf walks in a straight line to Sirie.
Lady wolf walks in a straight line to Sirie.
"Clearly not too much." LW sighs, "She's not too outgoing in that sense, is she?"
"No." LW says, "I guess I was interested in knowing how much you know about her."
"No." LW says, "I guess I was interested in how much you know about her."
S9rt 9f...
"Well, I certainly thought so. Did your friend Sirie ever mention it was stolen?"
"I apologize for eaves dropping, but I couldn't help hearing that last bit."
"I know! It really is a shame. That was a beautiful ship."
"I know! It really is a shame. That was a beautiful ship.?"
She's wearing a suit with a fur coat, and a new mask over her head. This one is ovular, pointed on the ends, with six slits for eyes. It looks like Vox's.
Lady Wolf walks out.
The door next to the bar opens.
Sirie shakes her head.
"Don't tell her to shut the fuck up like that. Rude."
"Hey." Sirie pipes up.
The bartender starts mixing immediately. A waiter picks up the drink, runs it to Veruvi, then scurries off.
Uh, excuse me? Can I get a rum and c9ke?
Veruvi raises a hand.
Well, y9u watch this.
Veruvi rolls her eyes.
Veruvi rolled her eyes.
"No."
"What?" Sirie frowns.
Like, sh9uld ap9l9gize f9r being all suspici9us? Cause like. She's 6eing pretty gener9us.
What d9 we d9 if it's n9t a trap?
So we wait it out.
“Ok.”
Cypress nods.
"Trap avoided"
"Trap avoided
"For my money, I say I drop my wall, you all get behind me, and I kill everyone." Cypress folds his arms.
"Mhm." Cypress says.
She just still doesn't get people things sometimes.
Its adorable.
Kisket hugs Qitara.
"The timing was very comedic!"
"Well, I thought that was an effort to share some form of comedy with us."
Are y9u kidding?
"I like her." Qitara pipes up. "I liked her landing ship a lot, and she hasn't said or done anything personally threatening."
fishy as fuck.
absolutely not.
puh! like, no! duh. 
So I guess the next thing is the vote on whether we trust this bitch or not.
Kisket looks around, then sits on a lounge chair.
They're left alone.
"Now, if you'd excuse me for a moment, I need a change of clothes. This dress is far too warm." Lady Wolf dips her head and heads through a door next to the bar.
"The bar is fully fleshed out, and there's a kitchen in the back, if you want anything, feel free to ask one of the waiters."
"We'll rest here while we wait to arrive, alright?"
LW leads them down a hall and into a lounge with a massive glass dome for a roof. There are rows of beach chairs in front of a swimming pool and a bar with a waiter in the back. 
The elevator doors open up.
“Well I can respect that.”
“Sticking to good honest work.”
sticking to good honest work.
"I've heard a lot of bounty hunters tend to aspire to catch famous pirate lords." 
"Do you ever hunt pirates?"
"I see... Well regardless, I always love bounty hunters, they're surprisingly easy to get along with." LW says.
"Really? You must lead exciting lives." LW claps. "What kind, though. Like criminal hunting, odd jobs, contract work for a specific faction?"
"So can I ask what you all do?" LW says.
"So can I ask what you all do?"
The doors close.
The doors open, they enter, and LW chooses a floor.
The robot stands behind them as they wait for the elevator to come down to them.
They reach an elevator.
They continue down the hallway.
Lady Wolf whispers to an attendant as they pass by. He rushes off.
"Sure. I'll have a bed prepared for you too."
Uh.
Not...
No I meant like. An actual nap.
"As could I!"
I could go for a nap.
Honestly?
"Me personally, I like to have some sort of tea in one of the lounges during long flights."
"If anyone's tired I can get some beds prepared as well."
"Well, that's good."
Sirie is in the unresponsive camp as well.
Cypress doesn't respond either.
"No I'm not too hungry currently." Qitara says.
Not really.
Tracy shrugs.
Veruvi shakes her head.
"Are any of you hungry?"
"Great."
"I hope you don't mind if I get you on a ferry from there to.... Zenithon? Or Veilus?"
"If I had the time, I'd take you straight home... But as it stands I need to return to Awakazi as soon as possible."
There are a few windows through which they can see themselves exiting the planet's atmosphere.
They follow Lady Wolf out of the docking bay and into a corridor along the side of the ship.
"Sure," Tracy says.
"If you'd all follow me?"
"If you'd all follow me?
Lady Wolf steps off first.
The black robot stares at everyone.
They land and the doors open.
There are some guards waiting outside the ship.
The interior is polished steel, with even white lighting spaced across the ceiling and walls.
The interior is 
The ship enters the docking bay.
"Wonderful, It's a pleasure to meet you all."
"Who are you all?"
"I go by Lady Wolf." She tilts her head to the side.
"Oh, I'm so thoughtless sometimes, I completely forgot to tell you my name."
They turn in their chair to face Shanta and Co.
The person sits in the pilot's seat and presses a button, the ship begins an auto-docking sequence.
After everyone gets on the ship, the doors close behind them.
"Excellent." They clap their hands together. "Climb aboard."
Up close, they can see the person is wearing a long robe covered in designs in varying shades of white. They get more intricate the closer one comes to them. They're also wearing a black veil that hides all but the dark mass of hair that's tied around their face.
They all follow her.
"Why don't you come down here! It's a little bit of a chore to shout into the speakers!"
"Now it's mostly disintegrated!"
"It was already a wreck."
"Nonsense! I was only helping to reduce your carbon footprint!"
"Especially with a ship like that!" The person gestures at the molten remains of Sirie's ship.
"Right now I'm your best chance off!"
"Well. For starters. If you don't come with me, you'll all be stranded on this planet for god knows how long."
"... I almost don't want to answer that question."
"Yep! Pretty unusable!"
A blast hits Sirie's ship for four seconds, reducing it to molten shrapnel.
A cannon on the ship above glows red for a moment, then fires.
"I don't know. It looks fairly unusable to me!"
"I don't know. It looks fairly unusable to me."
"But from orbit I spotted that ship of yours and I came to see if I could offer some assistance!"
"But From orbit I spotted that ship of yours and came to see if I could offer some assistance!"
"Well, first, I saw the oxium signatures and was going to make a stop on my way home, but they had stopped by the time I got here!" The person shouts.
Tracy, how do you know it's.... Actually. Nevermind.
she sounds nice tho.
Tracy shrugs.
"I mean my ship's right there..." Sirie says to Shanta. "Without the oxium signals going off, I'm sure we'll be able to turn it on..."
"I mean my ship's right there... Without the oxium signals going off, I'm sure we'll be able to turn it on..."
Sirie frowns.
"It looks as if you're stranded!"
"Hello!" The voice is amplified by a speaker system on the ship.
The person is in a thick, expensive looking dress. They wave.
There's one person standing in it, behind the person is a tall, black, bipedal robot, hunched over with one large red eye in the center of its face.
A door opens along the side.
The ship flies down and lands just in front of Sirie's ship.
The ship is white, ovular, with long purple and gold streamers that trail behind it fluttering in the wind.
It stays stationary, and a smaller ship flies out from a dock on the side of the ship.
A large ship enters the atmosphere above them.
Everyone rushes outside.
Sirie looks up. "What the fuck."
Vervui is cut off as a massive boom is heard above them.
S9. Im just w9ndering, like-
Sirie chews on her lips.
As in the sec9nd.
That v9ice d9wn there was calling you 02.
Sirie smiles, "Sure, shoot."
Uh. I've still g9t 9ne questi9n...
Kisket wraps her arm around Qitara just a little tighter.
"It was getting to the point where it was painful, but I'm fairly used to fasting." Qitara smiles.
"Had we both needed to breathe, and had I not brought water, it would have been a serious issue."
"It could have been better." Qitara nods. "That said I experienced being trapped in a small room with Sirie for almost three days."
yeah that part wasn't great.
at least, i don't feel like. too mentally drained or anything.
this one wasn't as bad on the weird oxium shit.
Veruvi frowns.
Sirie nods.
"So.... Uh, sorry."
"Hey guys. Uh..." Sirie scratches her head. "I feel like most of this is my fault. Pushing you all to come here and all that."
Sirie turns around.
Tracy's chillin with Cypress of all people.
Veruvi's hanging back with Kisket and Qitara.
Sirie is standing outside of the cave.
Sirie's ship is off in the distance.
They are all at the mouth of the cave they entered through.
Veruvi and Cypress leave.
Tracy walks through.
The lady raises a hand and waves.
Qitara follows Kisket.
Kisket looks around, shrugs, then walks through.
Sirie walks through.
A portal opens up at the top of the steps.
"Well the energy fields should have relaxed by now..." Toska says. "I'll open a doorway to the entrance you used."
"Well the energy fields should have relaxed by now..." "I'll open a doorway to the entrance you used."
"You're all sure you're ready to leave?"
"
"I can show you the way out."
"O-oh." Toska sighs. "I suppose If you'd like to leave."
"We're leaving." Sirie responds.
"What?" it says.
"We're leaving."
"What?"
"And Sh-" The voice stops.
"Show us the way out." Sirie says.
"02 always had a knack for languages. She picked up Ahmkara in a little less than a hundred hours."
"02 always had a knack for languages. She picked up Ahmkara in a little less than a hundred hours.
"She has her own, already, and it's impossible to understand. Much easier to get her acclimated to the languages we speak instead.
"It's important to introduce language as early as possible."
"Excellent!" Toska says.
The woman stands awkwardly.
"Okay well, any time."
The woman looks down for a bit. Then she hums low, then high, then low then low then high.
"Yea."
"Yeah."
"What's I name?"
The woman tries to copy the smile but it looks more like she's just showing her teeth.
"Any time."
"Thanks you for asking how hungry I are?"
"...What the fuck....." Veruvi whispers.
"Hi! How hungry you are?"
"Hi! How hungre you are?"
"How are you?"
She copies Voraj. "Hi!"
The woman tilts her head to the side.
"Nobody?" Toska says, sadly.
"Nobody?"
Her eyes close, then open.
She reaches the top then looks at everyone, one by one, she still lingers on Sirie a little longer than she should.
The woman struggles for a bit, then steadies herself. She climbs up the stairs with renewed confidence.
okay.
Tracy nods.
can i go?
Tracy looks finally at Shanta, he seems a little helpless.
He looks back at Sirie, then back at the other woman.
Tracy looks at Sirie, then at the woman currently trying to climb the stairs out of the pool.
"She has no concept of language currently, but that shouldn't be an issue."
"Why don't you go introduce yourselves."
The walls sigh, "Too late for that now."
"I've touched upon the feathers of gods and produced a masterpiece in the corporeal world. Hah... They should have named me Emperor....."
"It's a testament to the heights of greatness that we Ahmkara have achie-no, that I myself-have achieved."
"And essentially immortal too, aside from 01, of course, there are no known cases of a Svelle yet dying. Though I have yet to see what's become of 03. It's incredible, isn't it?"
"Precisely!" The room trembles. "Just look at its exquisite features, sculpted by god itself."
"precisely!" The room trembles. "Just look at its exquisite features, sculpted by god itself."
and that was.......?
Toska's idea of a perfect being, right?
which was........
"And that's why I didn't want to come in here and watch."
"I remembered just a little bit ago where we were." She frowns.
She rubs her eyes with her hands.
Sirie turns away and looks at the black stone.
"Fucking shit." Sirie sighs.
"Sirie, 02, The Tower, meet your sister." Toska says. "04, The Fool." 
The woman grins absurdly wide.
Sirie looks at her.
She looks at Sirie.
She looks around at everyone looking at her.
She takes the things and drapes them over herself, a little haphazardly.
Uti, Mars, and Aradia step forward, carrying some clothing.
Uti, Mars, and Aradia step forward, carrying some cloting.
Slowly the woman sits up.
Kisket nods but doesn't say anything.
"Possibly yes!" Toska replies, also whispering. "But also possibly no, it depends entirely on what you think you just watched."
"Did I just watch what I think I just watched?" Kisket whispers.
"I would ask you remain fairly quiet. She needs time to adjust to experiencing sensory inputs."
"I would ask you remain fairly quiet, She needs time to adjust to experiencing sensory inputs."
The room speaks quietly to Shanta and Co.
The woman on the bed opens her eyes.
The stream of light stops.
Matching eyebrows, and lashes, pink lips, all held together delicately.
The body now has a full head of snowflake white hair.
Sirie frowns heavily.
The figure comes to rest on a cushioned bed built into the floor of the pool.
It soaks up almost all of the liquid.
nothing!
Tracy looks at the ceiling.
the fuck? what?
Tracy breathes heavily out his nose.
Tracy breathes out his nose.
Fingers become defined, shoulders draw inward, hips grow, breasts take shape.
The limbs begin to extend slightly, it's waist begins to find a shape to settle into. 
It sprouts clean colorless eyebrows, and the beginnings of hair begin to grow on its head.
The body begins to suck in the black liquid through its skin.
It aims at the body's stomach, then holds still.
the stream swivels around the body for a moment, before focusing.
Eventually they all focus into one, and that lens wobbles slightly.
Inside is a multitude of lenses and mirrors that reflect and refract the light into dozens of streams of colors.
The dome opens.
The stream of light reaches the upper dome.
The body is hairless, sexless, colorless. It's bland in every way.
Inside is a body, submerged in black liquid.
As the lenses continue to fall into place, the dome in the floor splits down the center.
Other lenses drop and swivel to catch and refocus the stream of light.
The streams of light converge at the hole in the center, and a lens from the ceiling drops down to redirect it.
The etchings on the stone slab begin to glow, faintly at first, then in bright streams of white light.
"Excellent! Now, let us proceed as procedure dictates."
"No more questions then?"
"I'm sure she'd be very, very happy to share with you all."
"She'd know a lot about what's coming."
Sirie frowns.
"I could tell you, but that would ruin the surprise... If you don't care much for spectacle, I suppose you could ask your white-haired friend. Sirie? You called her now?"
Tracy frowns.
"Yes, more or less."
"Well, an occasion like the one you all will bear witness to is always in need of spectators. You just happened to land your ship on my planet at the right time. I suppose I found it all to be... Auspicious?"
"Imprints in the oxium that brought this facility back to life. I asked them to take a form that was comfortable and inviting, specifically for you all."
"Images."
"Yes."
"An unexpected influx of oxium came through means that I am, as of yet, still unsure of." The walls reverberate.
"We've recently experienced a revival of sorts, which is why those three, who guided you here, currently exist."
"Well, nothing in particular any more. Not since our extermination."
"This is installation 06," The room says happily, "a top secret facility where Ahmkara scientists researched the usage of oxium for the express purpose of creating and altering lifeforms."
"This is installation 06," The room says happily, "A top secret facility where Ahmkara scientists researched the usage of oxium for the express purpose of creating and altering lifeforms."
"For any of you who are wondering, you're currently speaking to Toska Fari, or at least the downloaded consciousness of him. If you have any questions for me before we begin, I'd be happy to answer them for you."
"That's good." The room says.
no... not really...
no... not relly...
Tracy shakes his head.
uh.
"I hope getting here wasn't too much trouble."
"Hello," the room says. It's voice is soft, unisex, pleasant.
um...
Tracy shifts from side to side.
Nobody says anything.
You will now speak to Coronus, The Omnicron, The 0th Sentinel. Uti says.
Veruvi watches Sirie stare sullenly at the space between the two domes.
Kisket frowns.
A part of the wall descends from above to fill in the entrance.
Mars, Uti, and Aradia funnel the the group onto the two platforms. They themselves remain below.
There are two sets of stairs on either side of the room, that lead to raised walkways around the dome, near the back of the room, the walkways have a set of stairs of their own that reach a platform set up at the base of the hole in the slab.
The slab itself is covered in etchings that match those of the domes.
There's a hole cut into the slab, that doesn't quite reach all the way through. 
Past the domes stands a massive slab of black stone.
The domes themselves are etched with markings that don't look to be any discernible language.
The domes themselves are etched with markings that don't look to be any discernable language.
Attached to the hanging dome are several lenses of varying shapes and sizes.
There's a large dome in the center of the room, and a similar one hanging over it from the ceiling.
They enter a circular room.
They head onwards.
The glow from further inside the tunnel is warm and inviting.
It hardens into the ground around them.
It merges with the pools of water.
The metal flows into the walls and the floor.
It pools onto the ground.
The metal slowly melts.
They walk forward, until their bodies touch it, then keep going, until they enter the plate entitrely.
They reach their arms into the metal.
The other two nod.
Great. Mars says. Good. Lets open the door then, shall we?
Edited previous message: "Alright."
Alright.
Sirie steps forward.
"No, I'll do it."
Sirie frowns.
Edited previous message: So that one, Aradia says, pointing at Sirie. Will enter first.
So that one, Aradia says, pointing at Sirie. will enter first.
Coronus wants this moment to be perfect.
We're going to open it for you. Uti says.
Dust filled Aradia and blood soaked Uti climb out of the portal in the ground after Mars.
Don't just mess with the door like that.
Oil-covered, plate-faced Mars appears out of the ground next to Shanta.
Edited previous message: Stop stop stop!
Stop stop stop!_
Qitara frowns.
"Don't bite it."
"No." Sirie says.
"No."
Sirie frowns.
But nothing in particular happens.
The glow from behind gets a little brighter.
Water drips from stalactites above it.
There's a dull orange glow coming from behind it.
It's made of a mottled metal that looks like copper or bronze.
The way forwards is blocked by a circular plate in the wall.
After a short walk they reach a dead end.
They head down the tunnel.
Edited previous message:  "Fine." Cypress says.
Edited previous message:  "Fine." Cypress says."
Edited previous message:  "Fine." Cypress said.
 "Fine.
Cypress frowns.
Cypress falls forward.
Tracy lets go.

They head up to cypress.
"The fuck?" He says.
He looks around.
Cypress stops in place.
Tracy uses pull at full mast.
alright.
full mast you said?
or quarter mast?
or half?
full mast?
right, fuck.
He's keeps stomping onward.
Cypress is halfway down the tunnel already.
"Uhm." Qitara says, "Lets hurry, though."
Kisket and Qitara look down the tunnel.
lets just get going.
yeah
Sirie nods.
"Man I wish we didn't come here."
"S' just not right."
She glances at Veruvi.
Edited previous message: "You know what? Whatever."
"You know what. Whatever.
"But."
"I doubt we'll be able to do that."
Edited previous message: She trails off.
"
"I... Uh."
She shakes her head.
Sirie takes a breath.
"Shit."
Sire frowns.
"Head back."
"We can go up there."
Sirie points at the tunnel Raros came down.
Sirie frowns.
Edited previous message: "Nononono. Nothing good up there."
"Nononono." Nothing good up there.
"NO!" Sirie shouts.
Everyone is in the tunnel.
They make it through the door.
"WE'RE COMING!"
Edited previous message: "HEY!" Sirie waves.
"HEY!"
He sees Sirie and Qitara jogging over to them.
It opens.
"I just want to go home."
"No?" Cypress frowns. "My head hurts too much to tell jokes."
"And if I stayed with them, they'd obviously kill me."
"I left them behind because they were clearly oxium temptation demons."
"Who?"
"Pushed the buttons."
"Did all the crap."
"I went through the door."
"I did it."
He looks straight at Shanta.
He stomps right up to everyone.
A door opens in the wall, and Cypress steps through.
They wait longer.
fine.
Tracy frowns.
all in favor of staying?
okay.
I'm with moving.
Kisket raises her hand.
Veruvi frowns.
Kisket looks around.
Tracy pumps his fist in the air.
aye!
right. all in favor of moving on, say aye.
Tracy nods enthusiastically.
go forward or stay?
why don't we vote on it?
I don't either.
Talking too much?
I think she's been acting a little odd.
I guess.
You do?
we can peek and come back.
fuck that. now i wanna see what's ahead even more.
really?
Edited previous message: "And she looked very upset." Qitara sounds concerned.
Edited previous message: "She was translating at first but then she stopped in the middle of a speech." Qitara says.
Alright.
She hangs up.
Sirie doesn't say anything.
"And she looked very upset."
Edited previous message: "She was translating at first but then she stopped in the middle of a speech."
"She was translating at first but then she stopped in the middle of a speech.
"I would like to know too." Qitara's voice pipes in.
"Um."
"Lets just."
Sirie sighs.
"Whatever you do. Don't keep going okay?"
"It's NOT worth it."
"Whatever is ahead of you guys? Alright?"
"So."
"Okay."
That was really quick.
She answers and puts it on speaker again.
Kisket's phone rings again.
A minute passes.
They wait.
Sure.
Kisket rests her head against the wall.
She shakes her head.
Veruvi shrugs. "I don't know."
Cause she's a crazy 6itch.
Veruvi nods.
She d9es that crap 9n every single call.
That was Sirie, y9u kn9w. Making th9se s9unds?
Veruvi frowns.
Kisket frowns.
The call ends.
"Krashssjt! OKay! See you! BUH BYE! Qitara gimme my phone."
"Sorry, Oxium vision en route!" Sirie says. "Krsssht Kzzztt! We're breaking up!"
"YEah it's a good tim- Oh shit! Look at that guy!"
"He's like a fuckin zombie!" Sirie says, "Stomping around all angry and shit."
"We're following him right now. He hasn't talked very much, surprisingly."
Edited previous message: "Siri and I were released from the room by Cypress."
"Siri and I were released from the room by cypress."
"This is good news."
 "Well I hope you find something," Qitara says.
Kisket visibly relaxes.
"How are you?!"
"Hello.... Voraj?"
"Oh there's Shanta."
Kisket nudges Shanta.
"They don't seem to be responding."
"Um."
"Hello everyone else."
Edited previous message: "Kisket?" Qitara says.
"Oh! That is good."
I'm with everyone else right now, I put you on speaker phone.
Qitara! Hi!
"Kisket?"
There's a rustle.
"Hey Kisket, Qitara wanted to call, lemme give her the phone."
Sirie, hello?
She answers the call.
Kisket pulls out her phone. She puts it on speaker.
Hold on.
Uh.
Kisket's phone buzzes.
------------------------------------------------
Sirie takes out her phone.
Qitara nods.
"Wanna call her again?"
"I don't."
Qitara shakes her head.
"So..." Sirie asks, looking at all the pictures, "do you think Kisket's still alright?"
Sirie and Qitara are walking behind him.
He just keeps stomping forward.
He doesn't stop to look at any pictures, he doesn't go in any doors.
Cypress walks down a long hallway filled with pictures of different people in lab coats, holding little plaques.
{Door 6}

Well. Lets keep going then.
Alright.
Her hand is still firmly on her gun's grip.
Kisket nods.
Qitara's not with you, is she?
Kisket puts her gun away.
... Okay.
She walks a little closer.
Just not to be an asshole or anything, but I kinda feel like I gotta check...

Tracy shakes his head.

They head over and meet up with Veruvi, Dir, Raros and Elesa.
9h, Tracy, is that y9u?
One of the people looks over.
hey! who's there?
There are some people up ahead.
They walk into a long cavern, lit by pools of water in the floor.
Shanta, Voraj and Tracy come out the other side of the door.
------------------------------------
S9. Did y9u guys see anything interesting?
Veruvi looks between Raros and Elesa.
Veruvi, Dir, Raros, and Elesa are left alone.
She walks through the wall behind them.
Good bye!
I'm very happy.
Oh thank goodness.
Say yes please.
Please say yes.
This is becoming upsetting.
I can't leave until you say you are.
Are you comfortable?
Hello.
Dir.
Dir.
Hello.
The dust lady is snapping her fingers in Dir's face.
Mars drops through the portal.

Veruvi looks at Raros.
Um. What. The fuck. Did I just l99k at.
Veruvi looks at the oily guy. Her mouth falls open.
The oily guy wraps the swirly one in something resembling a hug.
THANK YOU. These people just don't understand true comedy when they hear it.
Ah! Mars! I thought I heard an immensley funny joke.
There's another figure here, this one made of swirling dust, and rock, with a metal band where its head should be.
Veruvi and Dir are sitting cross-legged along the wall.
They enter a long hallway, lit by bright blue pools of water along the floor.
And so the guy says, "Wait a minute, you're not my dad, you were a dog the whole time!" Hahaha!
Mars follows them all the way to the end of the tunnel.

Mars climbs out of a portal in the ceiling ahead of Raros.

Not a fruit, like all of it.
It wants the rest.
It looks at Shanta.
The snake snaps out and catches the fruits out of the air.
Tracy tosses the fruit.
Toss the fruit.
Just like.
It opens its mouth. It's got rows upon rows of layers upon layers of teeth.
Then it smells the fruit.
It has thirteen large eyes on its head. It looks a bit puzzled as to why Tracy, Shanta, and Voraj are there.
The head drags with it the rest of the limbless body.

So now you just touch the egg and it'll hatch.
They gather the fruits.
The oil dude points out the trees.
which fuckin fruits.
i WAS FUCKING RIGHT.
sEE!!!
And then it won't kill you.
You just gotta feed the monster inside the egg some fruits from the trees.
Well.
what if the ball was an egg with a monster inside that would kill me?
i mean hell
that's why i don't fuck with that shit.
yeah i am used to it.
its better to just not.
fuck i've touched way too much oxium bullshit in my time.
i didn't know what it was gonna do.
what?
Trying not to scream at him.
I was fucking
That fucker just stood like ten feet away and shot at it.
Literally all you had to do was touch the thing and you would have found out.

Voraj wakes up.
Tracy and Shanta have been digging for eleven hours.

He hasn't pissed in eighteen hours.
Cypress doesn't give a fuck about that.
Straight past the other guy who's stomping up to him.
He walks straight past the weird dude with hundreds of arms, who appears to be looking for a book.
He walks through the library.
If this place doesn't have one he's going to be disappointed.
Cypress is lowkey looking for the gym.
He's not a fan.
He is now in a library.
Cypress walks through a door and lets it close behind him.
Silently they follow him.
They can't really find anything to say.
Sirie and Qitara watch Cypress do this.
Then he walks straight past them and through the walls.
Cypress looks at them.
They land on the ground.
Sirie and Qitara fall out from them.
The walls separate.
The room shudders.
He touches the orange blinking light.
Cypress stares at the place where the door was.
This time he notices that the door he came in through is gone.

He narrows his eyes.
He looks real closely at it.

It's blinking orange.
There's a pad like the one outside, a few feet away from the walls.
He walks into a room with a pair of massive bronze walls.
Cypress heads through his door.

Tracy leads the way through the forest.

He tumbles into a tree and scrambles into a sitting position
Tracy rolls on the ground.
hOLY SHIT!

He tackles Shanta.
Tracy jumps out of a pair of bushes.
aAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Suddenly, they stop.
Louder!
Louder.
Louder.
They pick up speed.
And louder.
And louder.
The footsteps get louder.
Shanta hears footsteps crash though the bushes a ways off behind her.
 It says Decidera Conipera
There's a name on it.
It's lodged into the ground
At some of the shrubs and ferns as well.
There are tiny metal plates at the base of each tree.
Shanta notices something off. The air is too still, the light is too uniform.
There's a soft, distant sound of birds chirping.
The forest is bright.
Shanta and Voraj are in a forest.
Uti walks straight through the wall.

Uti heads to door 5.
The door closes behind him.
Very slowly, he walks through.
And slowly.
He slowly walks over to door six.
He very slowly gets up.
"Fiiine."
Cypress takes a huge breath.
"So it's fine if we wait like another ten minutes then?"
Then covers them back up.
Then uncovers them.
He covers his eyes with his arms.
Then his back.
Then onto his other side.
Cypress rolls onto his stomach.
"Ughhhhh"
Tracy is not in the room.
"He's not in a group."
"I mean I guess Tracy can do it."
"Who's going to do door six?"
"I think it sounds good."
"That sound good?"
Cypress rolls back onto his side.
"And then I'll do door six?"
"Twenty minutes?"
"And wake up in like."
"You can take door five and I'll go back to sleep?"
Shanta your friends are a mess.
Cypress shrugs.
You guys split up, but not enough to cover every door?
Definitely not Uti rubs the mask over his face.
Cypress points at doors 5 and 6.
"Nobody went into those two."
"No."

Cypress rolls onto his side, away from Shanta.

Cypress huffs and lies his head back down.
He looks at Shanta, Voraj and the blood guy.

Kisket nods and puts it in her pocket.

Kisket grabs the gloves, takes the man's place, and pushes her hands into the incision the man had already made.
There are a pair of gloves on the table with all the man's tools.
Kisket frowns.
The body is already dead, and shooting it didn't do anything.
The man clutches the wound, and continues to talk a little longer, before falling to the floor.

It stands up.
So you're very special. And its my job to make you feel just how very special you are!
Here, everyone's already dead! Except for you, of course.
I hope your journey here wasn't too uncomfortable.
Hello, welcome to the innerest, most insidiest reaches of our facility.
It stoops down onto one knee and looks up.
Great!
Veruvi nods silently.
Is it alright If I start over from the beginning?
It has almost completely settled down.
The mass stops a few feet in front of where they're standing on the submarine.
Veruvi tightens her hand around her machete.
Dir and Veruvi can make out arms, legs, a head behind the plate.

It would be nice if you could go ahead and be comfortable now.
Oh.... The door isn't very comfortable.
But.
Your friends are lifetimes away. But you're very close. If you'd follow me I can take you to the right door.
The plate spins in a circle.
Oh. That's too bad...
Veruvi frowns.
Are you comfortable yet?
Coronus also wants to make sure you're comfortable.
Coronus wants me to make sure you don't get lost.
Coronus told us where to find you.
You came here with friends, correct?
Thank you.
Well I'm very comfortable!
The plate looks between the two of them.
Oh. That's too bad!
So are you comfortable now?
Veruvi doesn't say anything.
We're all here to do our best to make you comfortable.
Well you're here now.
Oh. That's too bad.
Veruvi frowns and takes a step back with Dir.
Have you been well?
You're early!
The mass touches the floor.
Hello!
A metal plate tears itself through the rock and affixes itself into place near the top of the mass.
A mass of of dust and rock fragments tear away from the ceiling. They fly in circles in a cylindar that's vaguely the height of a person.
The pilot and the passenger fade away as they walk toward the exit of the room.
The floors are shiny polished stone, and the water refracts light onto the ceiling.
There are several submarines docked in a sectioned off area.

Veruvi nudges Dir.
It stops at a little dock, and the two up front open the hatch and climb out.
It rises above water.
The sub enters a tunnel.
Neither of them say anything else.
"He says, yeah. That sounds nice."
The pilot nods and speaks.
He holds it to his mouth for a solid thirty seconds.
The pilot pulls a gigantic bong from between his legs and lights it up.
"He wants to show fish dick how nice they are."
"Anyway he's saying now that his first shape shifter died, and he made a second series. And they're super nice."
"Yeah I guess so."
"Uh."
"Or the dogs with the squashed noses."
"Like a really fat baby?"
"Cause he thinks they're super cool, and their faces are so ugly they're cute?"
"And he really likes making eels."
"He says when he was first making animals he started with sea creatures, cause they're like easier?"
"Uhhh. The other guy's talking...."
"Haha your friends are weirdos."
"The guy just said he's genuinely worried that a fish might bite his dick off one day, but the risk just turns him on more and makes him keep going."
"Holy shit that's funny as fuck."
"They're high right?"
"Are they high?"
"And the other guy is like. Asking him if a fish mouth feels like a regular mouth."

Dir gets a call on her coms.
They seem pretty relaxed though, all things considered.
They're speaking in a language that's completely foreign.
Veruvi follows.
The two up front are having a conversation neither Veruvi nor Dir can hear from where they are.
There's a menu on each of the seats with around a dozen food items on it.

Huge fish swim past them, undaunted by their presence.

I mean it's close, but in the end they're totally different things.

Dickface?
What's your name hot stuff?
Mars runs a hand through his nonexistent hair.
Fuckin fine as hell.
Are.
You.
You.
No stop.
They're pointed at Elesa.
He sort of slowly moves them up and down.
Mars points both oily black hands in front of him.
Move move!
Dude move aside.
I'm not good with the- WOAH
I don't remember your name honestly.
Im fuckin with you. Sorry.
How's it going wrinkly eel boy?
Yeah you did.
Yeah.
We've met like two times?
This woman's on a hot streak.
We've got a winner here, someone get the fucking poker chips and the bingo balls.
Spot on, lady.
Oh shit!
"That's... Mars?" Sirie frowns.
Sirie narrows her eyes.
I like that plan.
You don't ask stupid questions, and just go through the window eh?
Here. How about this.
A black hole opens up on the door. A head pokes through. There's a metal plate bolted into the face. Behind the plate, the head is dripping with oil.
I mean I do. You don't though.
But come on we don't have all day.
I mean you could like. Break the door. If you wanted to. It's not a good idea though.
That's the fastest way, at least.
The window.
Not that way.
It's locked.
"Wanna try the door?"
"That's pretty nutty."
"He's got like fourteen arms right now."
Edited previous message: "Looks like the scene's over." Sirie looks at Toska's arms.
"Looks like the scene's over."
Nothing moves anymore.
Toska puts his head in his hands.
"Yeah..." Sirie says.
Toska speaks a little louder,"...can change shape at will. Will be perceived as potential military usefulness." He puts the pen down.
He sits back down, opens his notebook, and writes again, talking quietly to himself as he does.
He sighs.
Toska watches the door for a moment.
The door behind them slams open, then shut.
"Try it out, I'll give you a cookie for every person you fool." Toska grins.
"If you put on my coat, and try pretending to talk like me, I bet none of the others will be able to tell the difference."
"Tell you what," Toska takes off his coat. His arms fall around him.
"Now we really do look just like one another."
"Wow."
Then he nods with approval.
Toska watches a space in the air for a minute and a half.
"You can, really? I'd like to see that!"
The chair Raros is sitting in slides back a foot and a half.
"Yes you're the first! The Etzika are a brand new species. You could say I'm like your father. Even though we don't look very alike."
Toska smiles.
Sirie frowns.
"We want to make you feel welcome though. If you're lonely, I'd love to help."
"Nobody's missing. You're the first of your kind, Ishwani."

"Directions?"

"Okay."
Toska closes the book.
Edited previous message: "Pull up a chair."
"Pull up a chair.
He points at a chair in the corner.
"No I'm not too busy."
"Can I help you?" He asks.
He's writing in a notebook. He looks up briefly when they enter, but returns his attention to his writing.
He's got a lot of arms. His coat doesn't have enough sleeves for them, so they pile up behind him in his chair, twisting and turning.
And his arms.
He'd look human if not for his nose.
At the desk is a man in a white coat. He's got medium length black hair.
There's a window with a view of a serene beach to their left. Waves rolling gently onto white sand.
Inside is a sparse office space.
They open the door.
They reach the planet. Sirie heads to the back to let everyone know they're almost there.
[Commission 60: The Fool]
"Toskaa...... Fara, Toska.... Fareh, Toska Fari. Nice."
Eventually they reach T.
There are a lot of names, and they're listed in alphabetical order.
They walk down the helix hallway, checking the doors they walk by for names.
It's the same for the other side.
The Siries continue infinitely down the straight hallway.
He sees Sirie in front of him, then another a little ways off in the distance, followed by another much farther off.
"I need a haircut."
"I think I pull off a good enough 31."
Sirie looks down the hallway.
"I don't fight anymore so I don't have to see this stuff."
Sirie nods.
"You get used to it."
"That's pretty weird."
"Ohh wow."
Sirie heads a couple feet down the left path.
"Nice."
Sirie nods.
The hallway twists in on itself in a helix formation.
There's a hallway that stretches out infinitely to their left and to their right.
They step outside.
The doors open smoothly.
They head to floor -20.
The doors open and they step inside.
It takes about fourty seconds.
They wait for the elevator to arrive.
The receptionist waves back.
There's an elevator that heads down there right down the hall.

"Not sure."
"It's home to someone special named dr. Toska Fari."
"Oh."
"It's a hospital."
The receptionist responds.
Sirie starts growling and squeaking incoherently.

"She thought you said something about their toilet paper making you itch in all the right places."
Sirie laughs.
She speaks again.
They say something amicably in a language Raros does not understand.
The person has long dark hair, and is wearing blue eyeliner, but its hard to tell if they're male or female.
There's a person at the receptionist's desk.
Behind them are large glass windows. The sun shines through them.
They're in a lounge area.
The door closes behind them.
{Door 2: Raros, Elesa, Sirie}

"Oh shit."
Cypress looks up.
The doors close.
They all head through the doors.
Cypress lies back down.
Sounds good.
Alright.

Cypress just got assigned to our group.

I feel like that never happened.
Can we like stop for a minute and hash out our goal here?
Definitely.
Tracy walks back to the rest of the group.
...cause we brought anyone who wanted to come.
Why'd we bring the impulsive, hyperactive raptor?
The door won't budge.
He tugs on it, pushes it, slams on it, punches it.
Tracy runs to the door.
oh shit!
The door closes behind her.
Shanta runs after Voraj
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A section of the wall opens up, and the thing carrying Voraj heads through.
Okay!
Voraj is covered in blood where she touches him.
Hup!
He picks up Voraj over his shoulder.
I'm gonna go without you if you aren't ready! Haha!
He looks at Shanta.
It continues to bleed.
It reattaches the plate to its face.
Haha. That would have been bad.
Oh! There it is!
It searches the room frantically, until it stumbles on the metal plate.
I lost it.
Oh no.
Where'd my face go?
He looks around, surprised for a bit.
We don't want that.
Or else The Fool will be unhappy.
We gotta get you to the rest of your friends.
I'll carry her then.
Okay.
No?
Is the raptor ever gonna wake up?
Haha!
About you, that is.
He doesn't think very much.
Actually I'll tell you what he doesnt' think.
I'll tell you what he thinks of you.
Yeah! It is a pretty good joke! Haha.
Cause I'm your brother!
Stop!
Blood sprays across the walls and the floor.
Blood splatters out the hole made by the gunshot.
His face begins to bleed some more.
Edited previous message: It's Uti.
It's uti.
It's me!
The bleeding stops and the skin heals immediately.
His face is now bleeding profusely.
The metal tears off of his face, along with most of his skin.
Almost....
Something tears.
He pulls really hard. The metal's covered in bloody fingerprints.
Fuck.
This thing just.... Doesn't come off.
It starts to pull at the metal on its face.
Let me....
You wouldn't believe me, would you.
Wait.
Okay.
Do you want to know what your brother thinks of you?
Wow.
Like face first.
I thought the joke was pretty clever, but you decided to walk into the mirror.
You're not very smart, are you?
Then at Shanta.
The man looks at Voraj.
Not very cool of you.
Edited previous message: Ow.
ow.
blood splatters through the wound and onto the floor.
The mask doesn't have any features on it, aside from a plate that fans out over his head.
There's a male humanoid standing over her. He's covered in blood, and has a large metal mask grafted onto his face.
Voraj is lying on the ground on the other side.
The mirror shatters.
Knock knock, it's supposed to be simple.
Knock knock!
Edited previous message: Then back on the one in front of Shanta.

There's another knock, but on a different mirror pane.
It's a fucking mirror.
She mashes her face into the mirror.
Which should have been obvious, considering she was knocking on it earlier.
It's flat and cold like a mirror.
Come over here and find out.
Knock knock.
Voraj is gone.
I took your friend.
Knock knock
Shanta's image in the mirror smirks at her.
Something stupid as fuck.
Knock knock
Knock knock
Edited previous message: Knock knock

Shanta hears a loud pair of knocks from the other side of the mirror.
Voraj in the mirror is asleep on the floor, looking fine.
But it looks like it's just a regular mirror.
If she jumps she probably could.
It's a little too high.
Shanta can't see where Voraj is lying in the mirror.
It's just Shanta.
There's nothing in the mirror.
From the direction of the mirror.
Shanta feels like someone's watching her.
The room is still.
"Yeah bye!"
"Oh alright."
"Hey I'm great company!"
"She also says: Please come and rescue us quickly, I do not know how much longer I can bear to spend in a box with this woman."
"Oh Qitara says good luck!"
"Now that I know that I can call people I'm gonna try everyone. If anything's up I'll let you know okay?"
"Anyway, yeah."
"Sounds like we were missing a bit of the conversation there."
Edited previous message: "Huh." Sirie says.
Huh.
The speech stops.
"Good! I know I am too."
"I hope you all are ready."
"Or the first rung on a very tall ladder."
"It'll be our first stepping stone through a very large river."
"This book. It's a good start I think."
The book flips through its pages.
"Most of his notes are on that."
"Toska focused entirely on the randomness aspect."
"Hah, I know.... What a terrible idea."
"We'd be treated like kings, wouldn't we."
Edited previous message: "Imagine we present the emperor with immortality?"

"The oxium in the blood is related closely to the longevity of the lifeform, and the ...randomness... randomness? of its form."
Edited previous message: "Uhh. He's saying." Sirie lowers her voice a bit, "Toska's notes refrence an inherently high blood oxium content in all forms of Ahmkara."

The alien speaking is still going on.
"And he's really loud and annoying."
"I can't help but notice but there's someone talking to you."

"Yeah! I'm talking to Shanta right now."
She hears a garbled "It worked?"
"Shanta?" It's Sirie's voice. "Wow I didn't think this would work."
Shanta gets a call on the team channel.
It begins to speak in a language Neither Shanta nor Voraj understand.
Then flips two more
It stops.
The book flips through pages.
The thing that might possibly be sitting at the desk sort of looks at the tables maybe.
It's hard to say one way or the other.
But there might maybe be something there most of the time.
Sometimes there definitely isn't a person at the desk.
Edited previous message: There's sort of something sitting at the desk maybe.

Kind of.
The desk isn't empty.
The book opens.
The desk is empty, there's a book on top of it.
The arms are loaded with drills, saws, scalpels, pliers, tweezers, et cetera.
Mechanical arms pry themselves out of panels along the sides of the tables and prepare themselves over the empty cushions.
Bright lights turn over the operating tables.
They enter the room.
Shanta can only see the outside edge of the desk.
In the right hand corner, next to the door and the bookshelf, is a desk, facing the center of the room.
In the center of the room there's a set of three operating tables.
There's a room with a large bookshelf on the right side and a mirror that stretches across the wall on the left.
They're a little tall for Voraj though.
Shanta can easily look through them.
Edited previous message: There are windows on the doors.
There are windows on the door.

The left door swings a little more.
There's a double door at the end of the hall. The left door is swinging.
It's lit by lights on the floor, angled at the walls to form a series of inverted triangle shapes.
They're in a hallway.
{Door 1: Shanta and Voraj}
The door closes.
Goddammit.
Kisket watches Voraj go.
The north door is door 1.
Hold on.
so lets see what's through these doors.
Cypress wobbles a bit.
Edited previous message: "Don't need it anyway."
"Don't need it anyway."\

He sniffs.
Cypress shakes his head.
He looks like he might be about to cry.
He looks at Raros.
Cypress looks up.
"It's not in there..."
"Its."
He frowns.
Cypress looks inside.
Cypress goes to dig in his pack.

"I see twelve" Cypress says.
Yeah, more or less.
like six?
there are a couple doors around here.
looks like
Maybe more, maybe less.
Shanta can count 6.
But looking closely, there are clearly several.
At first glance, there doesn't appear to be any doors.
The walls are white, but also gold, but also dull grey, but also silver and blue and red and purple.
They are in a circular room.
They elevator comes to a soft landing.
Just as quickly as it starts, it stops.
wind whips by them, they feel light, like they're free falling.
In about ten seconds it's beginning to feel like they're hurtling down toward the center of the planet.
It goes slowly at first, but it picks up speed as it goes.
The elevator starts heading down.
It activated as soon as he stood on it, but the stomping definitely helped.
Edited previous message: "That sounds like a reasonable course of action." Qitara nods.
"That sounds like a reasonable course of action."
S9 we head back in?
9kay.
There's no sound or indication that anything's different.
They stand there for a bit.
Tracy frowns.
Tracy looks at the button.
[Director’s log: I’ve yet to come up with a title for this project. It’s eating me up from the inside. I’m hysterical. With so much of the God Rock at my disposal, I don’t know what to do with myself. With Toska Fari’s research and my vision, I can feel my goal at my fingertips. I cannot be bothered to be weighed down by procedures.]
 [Director’s log: As of today, I have replaced Toska Fari as director of this facility. The high council approved of my project, and, with myself a facility of my own, and taking into consideration Director Toska’s recent major success, the council decreed a promotion was in order for the both of us. Toska moves to work directly under the Lord Doctor, and I now direct the facility on Crotia IX. What could be a greater turn of events than this? That’s what I had thought, until I checked the storage chambers to find not ten, not a hundred, but one thousand and one crates of Element O, left untouched. I could hardly believe my eyes. I still can’t.]
Veruvi, Cypress, and Sirie make up the rear.
Kisket and Qitara follow Tracy.
Tracy follows her.
The elevator goes down for a little longer.
...jesus what the fuck...
Tracy whispers.
The floor rumbles a little.
He lands.
He runs over and drops into the ever-growing hole that is where the elevator used to be.
Cypress takes a little while to notice.
Tracy Sirie And Veruvi Do as well.
Kisket hops on.
oh fuck
It slowly starts heading down with only Raros and Qitara aboard.
The elevator activates.
You're just going to stomp on it?
Raros really?
Qitara joins Kisket.
Kisket checks out the pad on the floor.
It's kind of hot to the touch.
Hmm. C99l?
Veruvi does the same, and her hand glows green.
He feels a bit of a spark and his arm lights up gold.
She frowns with Raros.
Sirie looks around.
The light in this room is unbearable, but there still doesn't appear to be any source.
There's an array of constructs, each humming with energy.
They head down the path and enter.

Everyone notices the tunnel is getting brighter, everyone's looking for the source.
They head down a dark tunnel.

The door
She presses her forehead against it's still-warm exterior.
Sirie rubs the hull of her ship.
i agree.
yah.
South leads toward the mountain. There's a small cave off in the distance.
The mountain is a little rocky, but mostly covered in short tundra grass.
They pile out of the ship
Everyone gets up.
Cypress slowly stands.
"Uh huh." He says.
Cypress' head slowly turns toward Shanta.
Everyone is relatively unhurt though, all things considered.
He's just staring at the ceiling.
He's sprawled out on his back on the floor.
Cypress was the only one who didn't manage to strap himself in somehow.
We'd all be dead.
Like... Imagine if Tracy was pil9ting.
She's 6ullshitting... The p9wer cut 9ut f9r s9me reas9n and Rar9s did the 6est he c9uld.

Sirie.
Veruvi's sprawled over her seat.
Tracy's hands are locked like a vise around his armrests.
"He only crashed my ship a little bit."
"No, Shanta, It's fine." Sirie holds up her hands.
It slides back into the basin.
The ship slides uphill for a moment, then stops.
They slide into a small basin in the mountain.
The ship slows considerably during the slide.
"You're garbage!"
Edited previous message: The ship shudders violently as it slides down the hill.

Sirie grabs onto the chairs to steady herself.
There's a rumble as the ship touches solid ground.
They pass the peak, and Raros angles the ship so it glides nearly perpendicular to the downhill slope.
Edited previous message: They head toward the mountain.
They head toward the ocean.
The ship bursts through a layer of clouds, and Raros can see a beach, a forest, a mountain, and the ocean.
They're no longer angled straight at the ground.
Just a little bit.
The ship pulls up with him.
The ship continues to fall.
"UP UP UP UP UP UP UP!!!"
"PULL THE FUCK UP!"
Sirie barges into the cockpit.
Then the controls suddenly grow hard to jiggle, like they're sticking in place.
The ship falls for a while.
Tracy's jaw is clenched.
Veruvi is grabbing hard onto Raros' chair.
Kisket and Qitara are as well.
The ship starts to shudder.
They're going incredibly fast.
They start entering its atmosphere.
The planet is very close now.

All y9u.
Yeah it was.
it wasn't just my idea.

So what did we get like....
Tracy sits in the co-pilot seat.
There's no effect.
She heads out of the cockpit.
Sirie gets up and pushes past Tracy.
"Alright, Raros, you take the controls, I'm gonna go check the engine and see if I can get anything running."
Sirie taps her hands on her knees.
Kisket heads back to everyone else.
Yeah that's fair.
She nods.

She looks out the window for a bit.

Sirie taps on the map.
"Uh."
All the lights turn off.
The light turns off.

It flashes brighter.
They draw closer.
The green light continues to flash.
They draw closer.
"Pretty interesting I guess."
"Pretty uh."
The light flashes rapidly.
"That's the signature again."
Sirie opens up the map.
A green light on Sirie's console flares to life again.
They head toward the surface of the planet.
Sirie returns and Veruvi swaps back.
Y9u helped a l9t I think.
Thanks Rar9s.
Hmm.
Veruvi nods.
She looks out the window at Crotia IX

Veruvi watches her, then swoops into Sirie's seat.
Sirie heads to the back to let everyone know they're almost there.
They reach the planet.
They fly the rest of the way to Crotia in silence.
Sirie doesn't say anything else.
"Can you blame me for wanting to talk to other actual adults every once in a while?"
"Fine I get it."
Sirie sighs.
"Where are you from?"
"Yeah, of course."
Sirie laughs.
"What's up your ass all the time?"
Sirie rolls her eyes.
"Yeah."
"Back in the day, I stole it with a good friend of mine."
Sirie activates auto-pilot.

"Yep, sure."
Sirie nods happily.

Sirie hops into the pilot's seat.
The ramp lowers and everyone heads in.
"Raros was saying bad things about you, beautiful." She whispers to it. "You've gotta show him your stuff now."
Sirie rubs the pearly white metal while she unlocks it.
They head to Sirie's ship.
They all head to the hangar.
Tracy sighs.
Kisket's hiding her eyes.

ay can we like.
"My ship's fucking awesome. When you step inside you're gonna wish you had a ship that was as awesome as mine."
"That's mean, Raros."
"Damn."
Tracy covers his mouth.
"How?"
"At least look at the thing before you bash it."
"You fuckin bitch!" Sirie grins.
Sirie frowns.
"You just want to shoot the shit with Krayna, huh?"
"They're in the same hangar."
"Why would it be faster?"
"Stop.... Asking difficult questions."
"I'll show you."
"It was built for 6 people to live full time in."
"There's more than enough room."
Edited previous message: "Yeah."
Yeah.
Sirie grins.
"I wanna show off."
"Mine is all clean and sparkly now."
"Naw."
Sirie gets up, "I'll fly us."

Tracy walks out ready as well.
Veruvi's in full gear.

The group walks through the doors.
The inside is brightly lit with sparkling white walls and ceilings. The floors are a light brown imitation wood. It's not particularly dirty in the main foyer area. It doesn't really look like Sirie uses this room at all. There's an expensive looking holographic TV mounted on the wall. Sirie turns it on. It looks like one thick pane of glass that the picture is projected into. It's been angled slightly to accommodate for the people who're sitting at the couch built into the wall on the other side of the room. There are marks on the floor that look like they were made by a coffee table, but it seems as if Sirie moved it to her apartment. The room is bare aside from that. There are three doorways that lead to the other parts of the ship.

Sirie turns on the map.
She looks over at it.
A green light starts to flash on the ship's map console.
Sirie grins.
Veruvi laughs even harder.

So a lot of things? You hang out with her a lot. Do you have a thing with her?

Tracy opens his mouth and closes it immediately.
You mean by Tobin, right?

Kisket tilts her head to the side.

so... you mean to say you've been like, literally living under a rock since you were sixteen?
Kisket, Tracy, and Veruvi take turns sharing stories of growing up on Earth. Sirie listens for the most part.
The ship is practically sparkling. They had ended up doing much more than they all had planned to.
It's been three and a half hours.
The four of them meet up in the cockpit of the ship when they finish.
------------------------------------------------------------
They all find brooms and dust pans in the closets and get to work.
Tracy rolls his eyes.
It's n9t wr9ng th9ugh.
what? don't put it like that.
Yep. My p9wers are super great. I'm like a human gar6age disp9sal.

"So on the left are the living quarters for the crew." Sirie points down the left hall and shrugs. "The ship was built to house six people. I don't have a crew and never really use that side, except for like storage.... We can ignore that side entirely. You've got the captain's quarters, the cockpit, the engine control room and all the system monitors straight ahead, defense systems, shield generators, and the stairs that head down to the actual storage room to the right."

Anyway.
You could have not done it.
Then I turned off the power before you could make up your mind.
I asked to go to the bathroom first.
I guess so. But from anyone's perspective it'll look like my idea.
Kisket thinks for a moment.
So don't worry. I'll take the blame if it comes down to it.
It's mine.
None of this is your fault.
Don't worry about it.

That sounds pretty scary for anyone who uses oxium.
Woah.
So it's like, and oxium sword?
Oh?
Is kind of freaking me out.
The whole hand squeezing your sword like hell thing.
I'm just saying.
You don't have to guard me if I head over there do you?
Cool, thanks.
Hey Ariso, where's the bathroom at?
Kisket gets up.
She glances at the sword.
That's uh... a little threatening.
Kisket looks at Ariso.
Kisket goes back to looking for the switch.
What are you looking at me for?

His chair slides back a bit.
Tracy stands up.
Tracy frowns hard.
Mars nods.
It was fuckin blowing its goddamn gasket.
We had no idea you guys were on this planet until your fuckin crazy fucked up ape thing started screaming at us.
Yeah, but you forget.
We figured they probably missed a ton.
Well we both know how bad Monad is at securing oxium.
What the hell else would we be doing on this boof ass planet?
Like good reticles are supposed to do.
We were scouting the robots for oxium.
And besides, how were we supposed to know that you guys had a base hidden in all these trees and robots?
And suddenly all your dudes were shooting at us.
We were just going for a little stroll.

They step outside.

Maw walks over to the glass and watches as a big burly Wall Agent stomps on the nose of his ship.
Some of them land on the nose beneath the bridge.
They begin to punch and kick and shoot at the hull of the ship.
Some of them, the ones with spikes or magnets on their walls, stick.
The agents float aimlessly off into space.
The vast majority of them bounce off.

Oh what the fuck.

Uti takes a grazing hit on his side.

[Combat start!]
"Oh shit it's some monad fuckos!"
And notice them immediately.
They stop for a moment.
There are 10 pirates that are running toward the right wing.
They enter the main hall of the ship
Edited previous message: "Alright."
"Lets go."
There are slightly more guards and less space to avoid them as the ship heads to a point at its front.
They make their way toward the helm of the ship.
Alright.
Siscal sighs.
"Talis wouldn't try to kill us, she's like my best friend."
"Pfft."
"Alright."
"If worse comes to worst, He'll just respawn back on the flagship."
"We'll just have to go by instinct."
Siscal frowns.
"I can't get in contact with Mer..."
"I'm totally down with that plan."
"So we're going for Talis first?"
A pair of the squads are yellow, indicating that they're under attack somewhere on the left hand side of the ship, opposite them.
Siscal checks her radio, it isn't working.
All of these locations are toward the back of the ship, while Maw is clearly at the head.
There's also a few singular cells in the back that are labled solitary.
The map of the ship has both a brig and a pair of prisons.
The ships layout is now displayed on their HUD's as well as markers for different squads of The Maw's soldiers, with colors showing their current status.
These are the maps used by the crew members.
They all download maps.

They walk up to a door labeled MAP ROOM
Mars shrugs and follows her.
She heads straight.
Siscal grins.
"I think we oughtta go straight."
She looks totally confounded.
Siscal looks at Mars.
Why do we need a map?
[Mars rolls a 19 for wisdom.]
They can go left, right or straight. The head of the ship is to their right.
They're at a fork in a hallway.
"First order of business... Find a map of the ship."
"Okay."
Siscal takes off her helmet.
Alright! We're in.
They all jump in and Siscal puts the piece of hull back in place.
Uti melts a wide square through the hull for them to drop through.
"But now I don't have to do it!"
"Oh that's cool!" Siscal shouts, "That's like, exactly what I was gonna do."
The ships hull starts to melt.
"Yeah we could try Uti's gun."
"I need to know the place where I'm putting a portal, like see it."
Mars shakes his head.
"Hey, Chocolate, can you do the holey thing to make a path into the ship from here?"
"Oh!"
Mars nods.
Uti, dude your guns are just looking dumber and dumber.

"Alright, Mermix doesn't like to waste time, he's probably already found a way inside.
The four of them are alone. There are marks along the hull where other teams have landed.
They fly a bit further and land on the surface of the ship.
They narrowly miss a piece of the hull.
They fly toward the ship.
A quick look, and they realize that the pieces around the ship are hitting the knights that jumped earlier hard.
They fly fairly quickly toward the ship.
"AAAAHHH!!!!!"
Mars jumps.
Siscal jumps.
"JUMP!"
"1."
"2."

She takes a deep breath.
Siscal frowns.

"Alright." fine we'll do it your way. "They jump first and I'll wait here to jump with you guys."
"I guess he can handle it."
"And that means..... Mermix will have to lead the charge once they're down there."
"But only after all my guys jump out on the signal."
"Fine. We'll turn the ship."
Siscal grumbles.
"Besides we're too awesome to die, haven't I explained this to you?"
"No it'll be super fucking cool."
"It's absolutely perfect."
"That way nobody will get lost yeah!"
"You'll stand on our backs while we fly down."
"Everyone has gravity boots, right?"
"No I've got the best idea ever."
"No that's a terrible idea."
[Siscal rolls a 19 for intelligence, and a 2 for charisma.]
Siscal looks back and forth between the two of them.

It's not like we're gonna fall on it.

The hangar doors open.
Everyone is suited up.
The ships are in position.

He can see a ship, it's looks like several rings of jagged edges and pieces of reflective glass, strung together to form some sort of unbalanced whole. It doesn't look like there's a main body to the ship at all, but from the right angle Uti can see the imprint left behind by an oblong shape hidden by all the extra pieces.

Mermix waves the chocolate bar toward Artesh.

Mermix sort of crawls over Uti.
Brian passes Mermix a piece of chocolate.
"Yo Brian," He turns to one of the knights. "Pass me the juice."

"WAit you don't even remember?"
"My dick's been metaphorically hard as metaphorical fuck for like 2 metaphorical years for this mission."
"Are you as hyped as I am for this shit?" Mermix grins.
Mars looks even harder out the window.
"Maybe for you."
It's been less than a week since he's last seen Mermix.
"Hey dude, long time no see."
One of the knights, some goat head ass looking motherfucker slides into the seat next to Uti.
The knights are talking quietly amongst themselves.
So Mars is looking out the window.
But it happened.
He doesn't know why Artesh is that third person either.
Mars doesn't know why there needed to be three people for this mission.
Artesh is there too.
Mars is looking out the window.
Uti and Mars are in a ship filled with New Avalon knights.
----------------------------------------------------------
Mars's hand is on his pistol, but he doesn't get to use it before he blacks out.
He falls on his ass.
Mars notices Ariso for the first time.
He drops it through a portal.
Mars limps over to the skull.
The forest floor is covered in oil now.
The oxium thing melts too.
They wriggle for a bit before melting.
Oil and disembodied limbs spew out of the cut.
The sword lands just below the skull and splits it open lengthwise.
It grows arms and begins to claw its way toward him.
Mav's shredded corpse is forgotten.
The oxium thing lets out an unholy, static-filled screech, and darts straight for Ariso.
AH!

From within them, a cow skull with antlers tears out of the oily flesh.
The hands coalesce into one long body.
[Mars' Oxium rolls a 1.]
She falls, and begins shouting incoherently.
Mav tries to shoot the hands, but they pull her gun away.
They pull on Mav and push her and hit her lightly.
Thousands of hands spew out from either side.

There is a Mars shaped hole in the tree, where he once was.
Maybe.

Uh.
Good job dude.
He is covered in oil.
Mars is embedded in a tree.
Hey man.
Kapri sheathes his sword.
Uti realizes he has been cut in half at the waist.
Kapri doesn't respond.
"Sorry kid. You're already dead."

He covers his face with one hand.
He stops.
He runs straight past Uti.

They all grab Mars and begin to pull him back.
Eight long black arms reach out of the portal.
A portal opens behind Mars.
He pushes his hand a little further.
Mars does as well.
Mars raises a hand out toward Rah Rah.
[Mars rolls a 20 for using his Oxium.]
Mars sizes up Rah Rah.
He doesn't even attempt to dodge it.
Xerpin looks at the shitty looking gun.
Xerpin pulls out a basic assault rifle, and Kapri pulls out a sword.

They fly back in total silence.
An hour later a Monad ship comes by to pick the three of them up.

Then the ship takes off through a hyperspace gate and they stop.
They tear all of it off and flip off the cameras.
Mars and Uti begin peeling the tape off their armor.
They all stand facing the ship as the bay doors close without them inside.
Petra walks stiffly out of the cockpit and off the ship.
Uti and Mars step back into the empty cargo ship.

Mars is moving them by tens with his portals.
Mars starts moving them to their ship.

Mars stomps on its balls.
Mars' acid shots wear off.
Mars shoots the body a couple more times to make sure it stays down.
His head crumples under the might of Uti's boot.
Uti power slams the mangled body into the floor and stomps on his head.
Mars riddles the guard with acid bullets while he's up there.
He hoists him into the air, Vlad the Impaler style.

The back door to the room opens up, and five guards enter.
Neon heads around the crates, looking for an opening.
It's not okay.
The ship is blinking red, and screeching at the top of it's lungs.
The alarms are on full blast.
There are two big crates in the hold.
They are in the main cargo hold.
They all hop out onto the cargo ship.

They can get onto the ship through the cockpit.
The  nose is just spiked enough to puncture the hull.
Peri rams the ship into the side of the cargo ship.
They reach ramming speed.

Neon nods.
These turrets are complete ass.
At the same time, his turret catches fire.
He slips and falls on the landing.
Uti jumps down from his turret.
It's time to engage ramming speed.
With only two thrusters left, the cargo ship has slowed considerably.
Uti's second shot hits one of the thrusters on the back of the ship, then it bounces off and hits three more.
Uti misses.
The cargo ship is nearing the next gate.
Petra speeds up to follow them.
The cargo ship is gaining speed.
&gt;I guess I spoke too soon.&lt;

Mars' turret jams, then catches on fire.

Mars takes the bottom turret.
There are 2 turrets, one on the top and one on the bottom.

&gt;You're trying to tell me to be considerate of people?&lt;
Mars tapes himself up.
They walk in a line for a little while, until Neon gets tired of the position.
&gt;I'm gonna try this on Kate.&lt;
Neon grins at each of them.
&gt;But it helps when the friends don't have a choice in the matter&lt;
&gt;Normally I'm not one for friends.&lt;
&gt;This buddy buddy thing that we've got going on.&lt;
&gt;I'm really liking this thing.&lt;
Neon gets between Uti and Mars and throws her arms around their shoulders.
They pick up black tape from the convenience store nearby and begin to head to the ship.
[Commission 56: The Color Neon.]
&gt;We've got a plan!&lt;
"Alright!" Neon claps her hands.
&gt;I'm not too into that kind of stuff.&lt;
Neon shakes her head.
&gt;That was not very cool.&lt;
&gt;Remember when you nearly killed Vica and I?&lt;
&gt;Hello Monad's AI.&lt;
&gt;That's Monad's AI, right?&lt;
&gt;That voice in your head.&lt;
&gt;That's cool.&lt;
Neon's smiling, her pupils are bright green.
Okay.
Mars nods.
What do you think?
Listening to this whole thing?
You've just been...
&gt;I don't have black tape.&lt;
&gt;Any more details you want to hammer out?&lt;
&gt;Alright? Are you ready to get this show on the road?&lt;
&gt;That was a joke.&lt;
&gt;I'm joking.&lt;
&gt;Damn, your biology sucks.&lt;
&gt;Oh really?&lt;
&gt;What do you say?&lt;
&gt;I mean it definitely helps, but I can make it work if need be.&lt;
&gt;I don't need you conscious to control your body.&lt;
&gt;You can get shot and die because that was a stupid fucking idea.&lt;
&gt;You could take your armor off for the raid on the ship.&lt;
&gt;We'll work something out.&lt;
&gt;That can be arranged maybe.&lt;
Neon waves a hand.
&gt;Maybe I'll name it. Something real edgy.&lt;
&gt;That I'll just keep with me.&lt;
&gt;A really nice one.&lt;
&gt;I'm hoping for a nice knife.&lt;
&gt;And the precipice is known on the more uncommon channels for its oxium weaponry.&lt;
&gt;Nobody should know about it, whatsoever.&lt;
&gt;The deal between Luden and GP just got signed off.&lt;
&gt;Not only that.&lt;
&gt;Go for it, dude.&lt;
Neon scoots to the side to show him the door.
Neon smiles.
&gt;I like you guys.&lt;
&gt;I don't give a fuck about any stupid fucking reticle.&lt;
&gt;Cause this is way more fun.&lt;
&gt;Oh that's easy.&lt;
&gt;I can try, I guess, but it'd look like crap.&lt;
&gt;I can't shapeshift into armor.&lt;
&gt;And once we're done, you get to take your pick of whatever we get, and you get to go home.&lt;
&gt;You'll do it because I want you to.&lt;
&gt;No.&lt;
&gt;You're still under the assumption that you have a choice in the matter.&lt;
&gt;Oh.&lt;
&gt;And it makes them pissed at you rather than at me.&lt;
&gt;It pisses Kaiden off.&lt;
&gt;It pisses GP off.&lt;
&gt;A few reasons.&lt;
&gt;What do you think?&lt;
&gt;That's where you come in, of course.&lt;
&gt;And we're gonna make it look like monad did it.&lt;
&gt;Right now we're going to steal the weapons from him.&lt;
&gt;We're not focusing on that bit.&lt;
&gt;Well whatever.&lt;
In my life.
Ever.
That's the worst lie I've ever heard anyone tell.
&gt;Beat's me.&lt;
Neon shrugs.
Neon grins.
&gt;Maybe you don't remember.&lt;
&gt;That night when the crocodiles killed him.&lt;
&gt;I was with you two when you escorted Luden that one time.&lt;
&gt;Yeah!&lt;
Neon frowns.
&gt;As the Amaranthe girl.&lt;
&gt;I had been stalking that man for two months.&lt;
&gt;I forgot you didn't know.&lt;
&gt;Sorry.&lt;
&gt;Oh.&lt;
&gt;OH!&lt;
Then she has a moment of realization.
Neon looks at Uti like he's stupid.
&gt;Why are you gonna help me?&lt;
Neon laughs.
&gt;And you're gonna help me.&lt;
&gt;And I'm gonna kill him.&lt;
&gt;The guy who killed the Sekko guy.&lt;
Edited previous message: &gt;That's Kaiden Trazch.&lt;
That's Kaiden Trazch.
A Kordovian, dark brown, with black zig-zagging lines across his face.
They're all of the same man.
Neon drops four photos on the table on front of Uti and Mars.
I don't know.
Mars frowns.
&gt;I wonder what happened to it?&lt;
&gt;Apparently that used to be one of your Monad places.&lt;
&gt;It IS going through Veilus from Luden's Precipice.&lt;
&gt;There IS a shipment of experimental weaponry heading to GP.&lt;
&gt;Anyway.&lt;
Mars slowly nods.
&gt;How about you tell me... If I get off track, that might help.&lt;
&gt;But that's not the important part, sorry, I'm getting distracted.&lt;
&gt;And I read a lot.&lt;
Edited previous message: &gt;And I started reading.&lt;
&gt;And I started reading.
&gt;So I thought, "why not?" You know?&lt;
&gt;Vica wants us to be more independant.&lt;
&gt;I came up with a plan, see.&lt;
&gt;All that stuff about the information I was going to give you is true by the way.&lt;
Neon taps the table on either side of her with her fingertips.
Mars frowns even more.
&gt;That was a cool tidbit that you shared about Rivium, Mars.&lt;
Me neither.
Mars frowns.
Neon sweeps her arm a bit.
&gt;Had to get you here.&lt;
&gt;I just.&lt;
&gt;First thing's first, whatever you think this is, it's not it.&lt;
&gt;No no, don't be mad or anything.&lt;
&gt;I'll give you props for that.&lt;
&gt;It was really hard to get into your head.&lt;
&gt;You're really stubborn, Uti.&lt;
The girl is Neon.
There's a table, with a girl sitting cross legged on top of it.
They're not strapped to them.
There are two chairs.
There are wooden floors.
They're in a room.
Uti and Mars wake up at the same time.
---
She leans over the back of the couch, accidentally placing a hand on Uti's shoulder.
She walks over to Mars.
Saime is in the room with a little bag.
The lights turn back on.
"Bumped into the wall."
"Sorry about that!"
It's daytime, so some light streams in through the windows in the kitchen and dining room to the left and straight, respectively.
The lights in the house turn off.
Nothing's coming out of that door.
He waits a while.

There's nothing in the mango juice.

Uti is alone with the unconscious Mars.
She gets up and walks behind Uti down the right hallway.
Okay yeah, sure.
Saime frowns a little more.
"How about I just tell you the deal, and I'll use some smelling salts on him or something in a sec?"

"Well."
Mars is dead to the world.
Edited previous message: "That must be tough."
"That must be tough.
"Does he have like an issue with that or something?"
"He just passed out."
"Woah."
Mars falls asleep.
"Yeah."
Mars nods. "It was like what you'd imagine doing shrooms is like."
"No, never."
Like, have you ever done shrooms?
And there was all this crazy oxium crap going on.
"Something."
"That's."
"Wow."
"Like, what's your shtick?"
"What do you do?"
"Cool."
That place was fucked up.
It was.
"Sounds dangerous."
Like just a few days ago we went to this planet called Rivium, wayy outside of Monad Space.
Yeah.
"Really?"
We've gone on some pretty top secret missions.
We're like pretty cool though.
"Duh."
We're reticles for Monad...
I'm Mars.
Uh- okay.
"It'd be cool to like, know a bit more of what I'm getting myself into here." Saime shrugs a bit.
Edited previous message: "Before we get to business, why don't you tell me a bit about yourselves?"

She looks back and fourth between the two of them.
"So..."
Saime takes a sip of the water she poured herself.
"If you say so."
Saime's face scrunches up a little.
"So like."
"I'm not a great coffee maker...."
"Right? I was surprised."
Oh this is pretty good.
Mars takes a sip.
Uti has a coffee, and Mars has some Mango shit.
She places them on coasters with pictures of sunflowers on them.
Saime comes back in with the drinks.
He doesn't say anything else.
Mars frowns.
...
Distan would probably tell me I'm in the right here.
No...
There are a bunch of worthy mouths out there that you're tryna just deny.
That's pretty fucked up dude.
You just want a monopoly on all my food.
Profernicus?
Fuckin.
Baldr?
Who else would I cook for, Ren-ia?
And like.
Well you were out on friday, visiting Shanta.
You need someone to eat with you or you don't get as much out of it.
Nah It's like.
What?
Aradia's an old friend and all.
And like
And I've been really into this whole cooking thing.
Well I can't like, see V that often.
...
Mars nods.
Is it gay for a dude to cook for another dude?
...
Im gonna make some for you sometime soon.
It was fucking dope.
Did I tell you I made some bomb ass carbonara for Aradia on Friday?
Oh.
Mars stretches out a little bit more.
From the other room, they can hear the sound of the refrigerator being opened and closed, coffee being poured, Saime softly humming.
Fuck. Now you got me all tired and shit.
Mars yawns again.
He leans back into the stiff couch, trying to make it a little more comfortable.
Feel what?
Mars looks over at Uti.
The pillows are a little stiff.
Mars carefully takes a seat on the couch.
Saime heads through a doorway to their left and heads into what must be the kitchen.
A glass jar filled with stones placed on the edge of a cabinet on the right-hand side of the living room.
There's a vase with a couple orchids placed in the center of the coffee table.
It's a nice apartment, everything is very tidy.
Mars looks around.
"Have a seat, I'll be right back."
"You too!"
"I'm Saime," she smiles.
The girl shrugs. She looks about thirty, but she could be younger.
"Water?"
"Um... coffee, tea (but only chamomile and peppermint), this mango juice i bought on a whim yesterday..."
"You guys want anything to drink?"
She lets them in the house.
"Come on in!"
"Hey!"
Hi.
A bit of a punk rocker vibe on this one.

The door opener is a human girl, olive skinned, with blue hair and dark eyes.
The door opens.
They wait for a bit.
Mars rings the doorbell.
There's a pair of potted shrubs by the door, and a mat beneath it that says "Home sweet home."
They speak to the receptionist, and their contact buzzes them up the elevator to the front door.
The house is part of a compact housing complex. It takes up the entire fourth floor of the building.
Mars has to clarify the address with Borealis a few times before they find the house.
They walk into a residential area.
They walk past a little patch of park nestled between apartment buildings, a few lupinian children are playing on a swing set.
They walk past this area.
The area nearest to the docks is full of shitty bars and clubs.
They head through the hangar and into the streets of the station.
C'mon, we've gotta meet this contact.
But that's his problem.
He's got issues.
That's almost as dumb as assuming someone's trying to one up your death.
What the fuck.
Ride off your yawn?
They're contagious dude.
Fuck.
Mars sees this and is prompted to yawn as well.
They hop out into the crowded hangar.
Mars waves bye.
"See you later."
"Im gonna look for a place to get lunch then."
"Cool."
Mars shrugs.
Maybe an hour tops?
Like.
"So how long do you think you'll be gone for?" Petra asks from the cockpit of their ship.

I'm gonna have to call in an emergency session with Set after all this.
I'm gonna.
Yeah.
Mars shakes his head.
Uti, did you talk to the voice in the golden park?
Yeah.
That planet is fucked up.
Mars frowns.
Oh, damn.
What was going on when we landed?
Are you alright?
Thanks, B.
Mars flips the switch.
And pull down to go up.
Go for it.
Both work.
Maybe I'll just bum rides off you.
Or
Me too.
Do you have a license for this?
Mars does as well.
Right right.
I guess it means she cant track you when you flip it.
Edited previous message: Yeah...
Me neither.
What does it do?
He sits it on the seat next to him.
Mars picks up his helmet.
Lets get back in the ship.
We're not gonna find out.
I don't think those are real people.
For getting me out of there.
Thanks.
Mars nods.
Yeah.
He swallows.
Mars nods.
Jesus fucking christ.
Jesus fuck.
Mars jets to his feet.
He notices the figures.
He notices the path.
Mars notices Uti.
Mars looks around frantically.
nO NO NO NO!
Mars stumbles forward despite himself.
Mars furrows his brow and keeps walking forward.
He starts walking toward one of the dancing people.
Mars frowns hard.
Mars steps out and guestures at the building.
Can anyone tell me what this is?
Hey!
Mars heads to the door and peeks outside.
Mars heads out to the first room.
Lets go.
Okay.
Mars frowns.
Mars looks up at the glass dome.
Well.
Mars listens to the voices.
Sitting there.
Or.
We can only try leaving.
It's over.
Oh.
Mars opens the door.
I'll take mine.
You just took yours.
We're taking turns though.
Nothing.
...
It looks like you already got more fucked up than I did.
No, I'll do it.
Mars shakes his head.
Mars frowns.
Mars can't really find anything to say.
Mars looks at Uti.
Mars drops the leaf.
Right.
Right.
What about burning?
Wait.
You're very easy to not listen to.
Looks at the veins inside the leaf.
He raises it up to the sky.
Mars looks at the leaf.
I get it.
Mars plucks a leaf off a tree.
How about I deny that purpose too?
Sounds like a shitty purpose.
To deny?
What's her name?
Mars starts to walk around the park.
Sure.
Mars nods.
As a matter of principle.
I don't believe in god.
About me being wooden is all.
I'm just saying you're wrong.
I know.
I wouldn't say wooden.
Mars stands up.
I don't think I understand.
Mars nods.
What do you mean?
Sort of like being dead.
Mars nods slowly.
And no sort of reality?
But no mind?
I can understand not having eyes.
Mostly, yeah.
Mars frowns.
Mars stares at this goat head fuck.
Mars heads through the door.
It'll be dope.
We'll switch off.
Mars nods.
Yeah, but the next one.
You'll eat it.
If it comes to that.
You get to eat the drug fruit.
I held the statue's hand.
I'm not making them do that, if it feels any better.
Sorry.
Mars makes another hand. It waves at Uti.
Maybe I'll just try and become the hand guy.
Or the void types.

I've seen worse inside my own holes.
That's me.
Totally unphasable.
Not at all.
Nope.
Can't phase me with this stuff.
As long as there arent any weird dancing fucker's I'm good.
Mars nods.
Sometimes you just gotta roll with your powers doing their own thing, right?
He drops his hand to his side, and a crack opens up around it.
Maybe the oxium's got the right idea.
Mars nods.
So I don't have to look at it, you know?
I might just put it back in that hole.
This is fucking nasty.
No.
Um.
He pulls his hand out of the water again.
Mars looks down.
I don't think it matters that much.
Probably.
The hand is in a crack again.
Mars' shoulders sag with relief.
Mars looks around for black figures.
Okay lets go.
With his good hand.
He pushes himself upright.
Fuck me.
He slides to the ground.

A hole swallows his hand, dipping it in water.
Mars lets go.

Mars grabs the hand even tighter.

Mars pushes it aside and touches the hand.
Oh mother fucker....
The arm slowly reaches out and grabs the hand.
Mars creates an oily arm to grab it for him.
Then he reconsiders.
Mars starts reaching out.
I can try...
Mars frowns more.
He's frowning very very hard.
Mars looks at Uti.
Mars looks at the angel statue.
Lets check it out then.
Okay.
Mars backs off.
Mars starts really slamming on the door.
Mars knocks on the door harder.
And knock on the door.
Lets go up to one of those houses.
Okay.

Why are the walls green and shit?
Mars follows.
Done.
They retreat back into the hole.
Thousands of little black arms reach out and feel the statue.
Uti and Mars can not see it from where they're standing.
Mars creates a wide crack in front of the statue.
I've gotta find a new word for this.
My glassy thing.
...
Edited previous message: In my crack I mean.
In my crack i mean.

For like future reference and shit.
Actually, I was thinking of saving this imagery.
Lets just.
I dig it.
Nice.
We're on the same page then.
Good.
I don't really want to know.
And they showed up way too fast.
There were way too many of them.
Those people out there got me fucked up.
Mars nods.
I mean fuck, you could say I'm an oxium bullshit connoisseur...
I can deal with crazy oxium bullshit.
You know.
Mars heads through.
Nah I'll go.

Mars bites his lips.
And quickly.
Agreed.
What the fuck.
Do you see the people out there?
"Uti..." Mars whispers.
Mars leaves his helmet behind.
Okay, lets go.
It worked out.
But.
You probably have waited for us to put our helmets on before opening that door.
...
Yeah.
They go back into the crack and it closes.
I like 'em.
The three hands wiggle their fingers.
Pull you into a hole... And have these hand fuckers tickle you to death?
I dunno.
I feel like I could...
Two more follow.
Tentatively, a little oily black hand climbs out of the crack in Mars' palm and looks around.
Mars opens up a crack in his palm.
I mean like, this is the most in control I've felt in a long time.
This place fucks with borealis, but I've personally never felt better.
It's weird.
I don't know.
Mars frowns.
We're alone now.
.......... :\
Mars does the same.
Mars takes off his helmet as well.
How the fuck can't you BREATHE???
What's going on?!
Woah!
Space ghost shit.
This is gonna be some ghost shit.

Mars looks out the window.
Mars puts his face in his hands.

Is that you?
You hear that B?
Um.
That's fuckin weird.
It's the opposite of how I felt back on Crotia.
Yeah.
Mars nods.
Mars gets in the pod.
Mars slowly nods his head.
Mars looks out the window.
Don't bullshit us, lets get going.
What do you mean?
I'm as ready as I'm gonna get.
We're totally good.
I was joking.
Yeah.
....... :\
That sounds absolutely fucking terrifying.
No.
I mean.
Sounds cool.

Alright...
How far outside Monad space?
Sup.

Yeah of course.
I wasn't planning on doing anything.

"Hey bros, come to send you off back out into the great beyond man." Mermix coughs a bit.
Before they leave, Siscal and Mermix meet them by their transport ship.
Uh. Yeah. Alright.
Mars nods.
"I will do my utmost to uphold our side of the deal."
He shakes their hands. "Thank you for your service gentleman...."
Amos meets Uti and Mars as they find themselves back in the courtyard.
Upon landing back at the New Avalon base, they deliver Talis to the medbay.
The ship's landing sets off alarms, but they take off before anyone can get out of the base to shoot at them.
They climb the ladder that leads outside, and Siscal calls down the ship.
They head back, to the hangar, up the vents by the stairwell, and Mars creates a pair of cracks that lead through the wall and back to the first room.
"Agreed."
Lets just get the fuck out of here.
Mhm.
Mars nods.

Okay, lets get a move on.
Catatonic as fuck.
Well then we'll have to make them catatonic.
That'll fuck her up.
Do that to one of Vica's guys in front of her, next time.
That's terrifying.
Jesus.
Siscal enters first.
Mars makes a pair of cracks to climb through again.
They carry her body back under the vent.
I'll make a crack back into there.
Okay.
Jesus...
Have you done that to anyone yet?
Yeah that's fuckin nast dude.
"... Woah that's gross."
"She can't even crawl she's knocked the fuck out."
"How's she gonna fit through the vents?"
No.
"I mean we gotta do that but we gotta do it quietly, so the guards don't notice us."
[Siscal rolls a 16 for wisdom.]
"...What?"
So lets just run out of here as fast as we can so they don't shoot us.

She grabs them before they fall and sets them down gently.
Siscal finishes cutting open the bars.
"Is she breathing?!"
"Is she okay?"
She drools a bit as her mouth hangs slack.
She bleeds from her lips. and her tongue.
Mars frowns.
Siscal lights her sword on fire and cuts a hole through the bars.
"Jesus fuck."
The heartbeat monitor beeps softly.
Talis looks frail, she's covered in cuts that have been crudely sewn back up. Her mouth is sewn shut, and she has both a life support system and a heartbeat monitor grafted into her right wrist.
Siscal runs up to a cage and clutches the bars.
"There she is! Oh shit."
Siscal frowns as she scans the cages.
Most of them are slow to look up at the three of them as they walk down the hall.
There are people as prisoners as well, mixed in with the beasts.
There are all kinds of different creatures in these cages, most of them look as if they've been cut, maimed, or branded in some way or another.
They walk down the prison hall.
Alright lets find Talis.
They drop out of the vents and Siscal slits their throats with a dagger.
They crawl down the length until they find a pair of guards.
"We found it."
"Sweet!"
Edited previous message: The hallway is dark and a little wet, there are bars lining different cages down the entire length.
It appears that they've found the prison area.
The hallway is dark and a little wet, there are bars lining cages down the entire length.
They head past a doorless wall and into a hallway that immediately turns left.
The left turn slants up, and the right heads straight down.
Theres a left turn, a right turn, and a straight path.
There are no rooms. but there are paths through the air ducts.
They follow the curve.
The hallway turns left again.
There are a few other labs, all working on different projects, from bio-chemical weaponry, to fuel efficient jetpack designs.
They head right.
Mars nods.
Do we want to sweep back that way?
Left goes back to the hangar...
They turn the corner and appear above another hallway, this one going both left and right.
I don't think being blood makes any difference to motion sensors.
We haven't seen any guards walking around...
What if there's like motion sensors.
"Yeah, lets jump down and break it all!" Siscal grins.
No.... We should just find your friend.
"We should steal their plans for whatever they're working on."
The room is empty.
Maybe some kind of armor.
It doesn't look like a weapon though.
There's some ugly looking machinery being designed down there.
The vent heads straight past the bedroom and into a little lab before it turns left.
They keep crawling.
"You guys have no sense of adventure.
Siscal scrunches up her nose. "Fiiiine."
It's kind of really dumb.
But it is kind of a dumb move.
I'm all for it, cause like fuck pirates.
I mean...
"I'd have a shitty week if my super nice bed caught on fire."
Edited previous message: "It would fuck up his day, or maybe his week!"
"It would fuck up his day, or maybe his week.!"
"No way, he's in the shower, it's now or never!"
I don't have any.
"We should totally light his bed on fire."
"Hey do you guys have any matches?"
"I bet this room is the Maw's."
Edited previous message: The duct heads straight into the last room of the hallway. It looks like a massive master bedroom, with a large king sized bed in the center of the room. Off to the side is a bathroom; they can hear the shower running from there.

It's totally bare, it looks like it had been cleared out a while ago.
The room after that only has two beds, and it's much larger.
They find that in the next room as well, and the next.
In the next room they find the same six bunk bed setup, with no people inside.
Edited previous message: Yeah.
They keep going.
yeah.
Yep.
Mars scratches his shoulder.
So I just make little two way holes and cracks and shit.
Was never curious enough.
I don't know what it looks like in there.
Nope.
Mars shrugs, then shakes his head.
Yeah.
...
That's weird.
Um.
Mars closes the hole.
Uh.
And a sun above that.
He sees something that looks like it could be a house.
He can kind of see something that looks like a tree, or lots of trees.
Uti tilts his head to the side a bit, and the image through the vent appears far in the distance and off to the side. Instead his view is dominated by empty black space, with what looks like afterimages that have been burnt into your retinas, blurry circles and lines.
"I don't care."
"Don't."
"Or like."
"Really? I just saw weird shapes. Try another angle."
There's a pirate in there, taking a nap.
All the beds save for one are empty.
There's a couple desks against the wall.
Looking straight at it, he can see the room under the vent. There's six pairs of bunk beds with nightstands and drawers next to them.
"Cinnamon, check it out!"
Edited previous message: "That's fuckin weird."
"That's fuckin weird.
"HMMMMMMM....."
"Hmm...."
Mars does so.
"Okay!" Siscal shoots him a thumbs up. "Now make the other hole in front of me."
You can't usually see the backs of them.
It's there...
They can't really see it.
Mars makes a hole.
"Make a hole that looks through that vent where light's coming out."
They crawl next to the first room.
"Okay lets try today!"
I've never tried just looking at one of them.
Maybe?
Um.
"What about you chocolate, can you use those holes as like, complex mirror systems to look through?"
"Okay."
Siscal frowns.
"Cinnamon, do you have like a super cool blood sense that can sense blood vessels and shit nearby?"
"Maybe there's a way we can like scan the hallway for people?"
"We can check every room, but I get the feeling that'll be a waste of time."
After the first left there's a few right turns that lead to different rooms.
The air ducts follow a hallway that also turns left after a little bit.
They go straight.
I can't even argue with that.
WOW.
First left.
Uhh.
"Okay, which way do we go? There are two lefts and a straight route."
They must have had their shields up during the explosion.
The room is blackened with soot, but there are four ships that look mostly intact save for some scratches and dust.
They can see through the shutters by their feet that they're above an underground hangar.
They crawl down a spiral slant that follows the stairwell, and land on a straight flat that splits off left a couple times.
Siscal takes the lead and they begin to crawl.
"Okay, lets get going."
Mars follows after Siscal.
Edited previous message: The vents are just barely big enough to crouch in.
Siscal shimmies down the drop and lands in the vent with Uti.
Mars narrows his eyes.
"Hey, Cinnamon, I'm climbing into your shaft!" Siscal whispers.
The vent's are just barely big enough to crouch in.
There's a drop at the end of the room that leads down to Uti's shaft.
Siscal smiles and pulls herself in, followed by Mars, who pulls the cover of the vent back on.
Mars steps aside, "Ladies first."
Mars elbows Siscal and creates a pair of cracks above him that let him reach the ceiling vent without jumping.
Well that's too bad.
Mars looks at Uti.
The one on the floor is not quite big enough to crawl through, unless you were somehow able to turn into a liquid substance.
There's an air vent in the ceiling, and another on the floor, next to a stairwell that heads down in the back of the room.
Mars looks around too.
I see.
"It was just Talis on her own. She's super cool, one of the best knights in the order."
So these other guys fucked this place up.
They can see the remnants of some furniture, and maybe a carpet.
There are light streaks of unaffected metal across layers upon layers of soot.
Everything in this first room has been charred or crisped in some way or another.
They take it down.
There's a ladder leading into the base.
"Nice!"
They start stomping through the woods until they find the burnt entrance.
...
"Yeah! SO lets go!"
"And Mermix is the only Pirren who would do that kinda shit."
Edited previous message: "I'd say we're gonna do some snooping, but really there's a big black hole in the ground that Talis probably used to get in through in the first place. So like if I said that it'd just be a lie to make me look cooler."
"I'd say we're gonna do some snooping, but really there's a big black hole in the ground that Talis probably used to get in through in the first place. So like if I said that it'd just be a lie to make me look cooler.
"First things first is to find the entrance."
"So!" Siscal whispers.
They all parachute to the snowy ground.
Mars thumps his fist against his chest and jumps out the ship as well.
Mars looks around him.
She opens up a parachute.
Siscal jumps out of the ship.
"Perfect!"
All the troops raise their hands.
"So who's staying?"
The ship comes to a hover above the forest where Maw's base is hidden.
They enter Roen-Heib's atmosphere.
All the troops grumble.
"Unless you have oxium powers."
"And anyone who doesn't like it can stay in the ship!"
Mars narrows his eyes.
"Alright! We're doing option B then!"
The troops look crestfallen.
"Option A is no longer an option."
"We're crossing A off the board."
"Hell no."
"Now you want to go with A?!" Siscal asks incredulously.
"HELL YEAH FUCK PIRATES."
"HELL YEAH."
"FUCK PIRATES."
The troops stomp their feet.
Yeah, fuck pirates.
Edited previous message: "You want to run in and kill everything." Siscal says, frowning.
"You want to run in and kill everything."
Lets go with A.
Mitchums nods. "Exactly right ma'am!"
"Of course you do, Mitchums, that's cause you don't know how to do anything else."
"I like the option where we run in and kill everything."
Mitchums clears his throat.
"Yes, Mitchums."
One of the grunts raises a hand.
Edited previous message: "They're all good options."
"They're all good options.
"Yeah that's the thing."
"Cause you know grunts, they like to bicker and banter."
"I just don't trust these fuckers to be quiet."
"I like option B, honestly."
"Option C will be slow, and we run the risk that they have much better security than we anticipate, and we may let them set up for an ambush because of that."
Edited previous message: "Really?"
"Really?
Edited previous message: "If we go A we run the risk of them killing Talis before we get to her."
"If we go A we run the risk of them Killing Talis before we get to her."
"There's good and bad to each."
"And Option C is that we run in there and try and take everyone out without triggering alarms, get Ao Zelen, and get out as fast as possible."
"Option B is to try and be sneaky, you know scope the place out, leave our clunky armor in the pods and sneak through the air ducts and crap."
Edited previous message: "So we've got a couple options." Siscal grins, "Option A is to drop in there, kill everyone and blow the place up after we find Ao Zelen."
So we've got a couple options. Option A is to drop in there, kill everyone and blow the place up after we find Ao Zelen.
Everyone takes a seat.
She pulls Mars in as well, then shuts the sliding door.
Siscal reaches out a hand to Uti.
"Awesome, right on time!" Siscal shouts over the sound of the engines. "Hop in!"
They come back as everyone begins to get in the ship.
Mars does the same.
They're in the back of the main hall. There's bathrooms on either side, but the ones on the right have heated toilet seats.
Mermix nods.
"Mermix! Tell them where the good bathrooms are!"
Siscal starts walking backwards into the bunker.
"Mermix will tell you."
"See you in a bit!"
"The bathrooms on the ships are terrible."
"You guys should use the bathroom or something..."
"Anyway! They're gonna have the ship ready in a couple minutes, I'm gonna go give a motivational speech to my troops before we board."
"Totally wild..."
Siscal nods, almost wistfully.
"I've seen it with my own two eyes...."
"It's happened before."
"But like you could cut off his head and he'd keep punching you until you both died."
"And when I say super dumb, I mean like sooooooo dumb."
"Mermix's powers are cool too, he gets really strong, tough, and fast, but he gets super dumb like as soon as he uses them."
"Nope!"
"It's a real hassle."
"Then I'd get demoted and file all kinds of paperwork..."
"Until I accidentally burn one of my troops."
"Yeah it is!"
Edited previous message: "So I try not to use them too much, especially when I'm commanding other soldiers."
"So I try not to use them too much, especially when I'm commanding other soldiers.
"Sometimes they set me on fire, sometimes they set my swords on fire, sometimes I can breathe fire, sometimes I shoot super heated fire beams out of my eyes."
"My powers do totally different things all the time."
Siscal shrugs. "It's reliable, though."
"That's a pretty useful power in a fight."
"Oh, cool!"
"What are you then, cinnamon?"
"It makes sense."
"What about you vanilla?"
"I know the chocolate one said reality warping powers."
"Do you guys have oxium powers?"
"Sure!"
AH FUCK!
No!
"And wanting to have sex with AI's is totally okay. Because they don't have bodies." Siscal nods.
Yes, exactly. Wait.
"Cause your waifu is an AI." Siscal offers.
And I'm not a fuckin creep who's waifu is a robot.
Yup.
My brain! Get it out of my brain!
AAAAHHH!
Mars presses his hands against his forehead.
Oh god.
What the fuck?
I've got an overactive imagination. Blame it on the reality warping powers.
Look if someone took your voice and personality and put it on like, any mildly attractive girl of course my heart rate would go up when I talk to you.
Oh really?
Hahaha!
Uti wants to fuck Monad's AI.
"That's awesome!"
Um what?
"Does monad have like cool laser swords or something? Do you have ships that transform into robots? Do you have computer programs that grow up into real girls?"
"Wow."
We're reticles... We do missions for monad and stuff.
"What do you guys do?"
"Cool!"
"So!" She smiles, "You're helping me on my mission!"
Mars shakes it.
Siscal stretches her hand out to Mars.
Okay.
Uh.
"My brother Mermix is retarded sometimes, sorry."
"I'm Sir Siscal Pirren, nice to meet you."
The girl stands up and reaches out her hand.
"Whew." Mermix tries to wipe the sweat from his brow, but he only succeeds in scratching his gauntlet across the top of his helmet.
"Yeah. I know."
The goat girl nods.
"It was your mission the whole time, Sis."
Mermix falls back onto the bench.
"HOLY SHIT"
Yeah.
Uh.
"They said that series of words???!"
"They said look for Sir pirren, SHE'S in the courtyard?"
Edited previous message: "It was a girl?"
"It was a girl?
He jumps up to him and grabs him by the shoulders.
Marmix looks at Uti.
"WAIT!"
"I'm sure they won't demote you too hard," She says.
"It's okay Mermix."
The goat girl pats him on the back.
"Again...."
"I'm getting demoted...."
He drops his head in his hands.
He sits back down.
"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!"
Mermix stands back up on the bench.
"FUCK!"
"Damn damn damn dman damn damn."
"Damn."
"And if you want we can go back to the pad and smoke a fat bowl."
"And then we can just forget about all of this."
Uh....
"Like be all. Nope that mission is for your sister or something."
"Or somethin like that?"
"Nah fam you good."
"Just say like."
"So like please don't tell me that I forgot that mission my man."
"And I'd be like yoooooooooo."
"Mermix duuude you fuckin suck at ur job bro."
"And then all my friends will be like."
"Like one demotion per month, bro!"
"A demotion a month, bro!"
"That's like."
"Fuckin three!"
"And that'll be thee demotions in three months man."
"If I forget another mission they're gonna fuckin demote me."
"OH fuck don't tell me I forgot about another fuckin mission, man."
"Am I doing that?"
"I'm not doing that."
"What?"
The guy takes another bite of his sandwich.
Uh.
"Well that's me. I'm Sir Pirren, and so is she," He indicates the girl. "We're both Pirrens, what'd you two dudes want?"
His mouth is full and a tiny piece of lettuce falls out from his mouth when he speaks.
He takes a bite of a sandwich, then says, "Hey what's up fellas, you're lookin for Sir Pirren?"
The dude presses a button on his helmet, and the bottom half covering his mouth opens up. He's got a mean goatee.
Her pupils are horizontal slits, like a goat's.
The girl has long ears that poke out to the sides of her head and her nose runs flat down her face.
The dude is in full armor, sitting next to a girl with long, wavy black hair.
They reach the bench.
Some people stare at them as they walk by, but most shake their heads and continue doing whatever they were doing before.
They walk over to the bench.
Mars follows Uti.
He stands on a bench by one of the bunkers lining the courtyard and waves his arms.
one dude in the back yells. "YEAH, OVER HERE!"
Everyone in the courtyard turns to look at Uti.
Wow.
...
Edited previous message: Mars looks around.
Wanna ask someone?
They look around.
I should've asked who the fuck Pirren was.
They leave, and head back to the courtyard.
Alright.
Uh.
Okay.
"Sir Pirren is heading that mission. You can speak with her in the courtyard while the preparations for the mission are completed."
"Alright."
Amos nods.
"But don't let that affect your decision."
"In all honesty, I would very much like Sir Ao Zelen back at our side."
"I chose those because of that fact."
"Both are about equal in that regard."
Edited previous message: "The pirates have some new weapon that they've been using to annihilate our men."
"The pirates have some new weapon that they've been using to annihilate our men.
"The Maw is famous for being exceptionally cruel to those around him."
Amos shrugs.
Which is easier?
Um.
"Whichever situation you'd prefer to handle is perfectly fine with me."
"And starting last week, our installation on Beaumare has been under periodic attacks from a group of pirates that are hiding in in the asteroid field nearby."
Okay.
"On Roen-heib, one of our knights has gone missing for over 24 hours. We believe she was captured by The Maw, and is being held in an underground base."
A lesser pirate lord, who goes by "The Maw," and an unidentified group of pirates.
"Both are pirate related."
"We have two tasks that we could use your help with."
"Excellent!"
Okay fine.
Mars frowns more.
"Think of the people who could benefit."
Mars frowns.
"We help each other."
"It's what Monad and New Avalon do."
You're asking us to do one of your missions for you?
"We could shift focus back to those areas if one of our problems was dealt with, though."
"Frankly we've had a lot of pressure in other areas, and we've had to compensate by cutting our manpower in certain, more domestic areas."
Amos thinks for a bit.
"I see."
I want you to fuckin' do a better job protecting people. Like the guy's truck had been missing for three days after he called you guys.
Mars' mouth drops a little bit.
"So what do you want from us?"
He stares for a long time.
Amos stares at Mars.
So yeah.
And that pisses me off!
Just to handle your shit.
Instead they had to call us alllll the way from the Godhead.
But
All they needed was a cop to come and taze the fucker.
Like a fuckin' tree branch, dude.
Like, some assholes stole a truck with a tree branch as a weapon, and took off.
Cause this was a simple deal that shouldn't have happened in the first place.
And I was wondering like.
We were just doing a mission on Roen-heib.
Uh.
So.
Shit, right.
Uh!
Nobody says anything for a couple seconds.
Mars is still chewing on the inside of his lips.
"I...." He breathes. "Would hear them now..."
Mars bites his lips.
"My men have said you come with.... complaints."
"My name... Is Amos Tolthiew."
Uh.
Then at Mars.
Then at Uti.
Then at Mars.
Then at Uti.
Then at Mars.
He looks at Uti.
He looks at them one at a time, his head not really moving, as his eyes switch between the two.
The guy looks at them.
Uti and Mars sit.
There's a big burly guy sitting behind a desk that was definitely built for someone much smaller than him.
They walk for a little bit and enter a large office.
Edited previous message: These are some really big dudes. Like 9 or 10 feet tall at least.
The soldiers leading them share a look of disgust after the people are out of sight and keep walking.
The pair walk past them and through the door.
"Thank you, little person."
The guy clicks a couple times, and their translators spell the words in a chat box.
Nice face you got there.
Nice uh.
Mars looks at the spider-face-dude.
Uti, you'll- woah.
Mars comes through the door.
Edited previous message: His head looks like a spider's.
Only it has about thirty eyes.

The guy on the right stares at Uti.
"Good to see youngsters doing their part for their galaxy."
He nods to himself.
"Hello, there, son, nice monad armor you have there."
The one on the right is bald, and his skin is scaly and stretched tight across the bones of his face.
They stop in front of Uti.
These are some really big dudes.
A pair of massive men are walking toward the door.
They reach another big door.
They walk up another flight of stairs.
Naw all you my dude.
Uh.
The guy with the massive shield has a machine gun slung over his back.
It's like they're back in the steel age. With swords or spears and shields.
Uti notices that none of the New Avalon people have guns.
Edited previous message: Uti notices a heated argument between a New Avalon soldier and a man with a big ass shield.

There's a crowd on the left side of the yard, opposite them.
They're all sparring with each other.
There are lots of knights in training gear.
They're led out of a bunker and into a massive court yard.
They are on Taragon's rock, a moon orbiting the planet Chiffewar. New Avalon's high council is situated on a colony here.
Uti and Mars step out of a teleporter.
[Commission 54: Merlin's fucking beard?!]
They drive off.
I dunno, man.
They're the ones who're getting screwed.
I mean what about the people who live here?
All I'm saying is this shit shoulda been taken care of. But instead we've gotta fly millions of miles to do some bullshit.
... Maybe?
They hop into the passenger seats of a snowmobile type car, with treads in the back and skis in the front.
I didn't like this whole thing. It smelled like bullshit from the get-go.
Im gonna tell that asshole what for.
Naw dude.
Tibe smiles genuinely, even though he doesn't know what for.
He scoots around Uti and into his cabin.
Tibe nods again.
Tibe nods anyway.
How is hot chocolate fire? He thinks, What does that mean???
Tibe doesn't understand what that meant.
Edited previous message: "Good fucking luck." Tibe whispers.
"Your friend is a fool."
"Good fucking luck."
Tibe looks at Uti.
Mars starts following them.
"Alright, follow us." The soldiers say.
"Okay," Mars nods, having finished the conversation while Uti wasn't paying attention.
Tibe looks at Uti like "what the fuck was that?" then he shakes his head.
Tibe's eyes close and he brings his hands up to pray.
Tibe mouths "please save me" back.
What?
Mars looks back.
Tibe frowns.
Yeah I'd like that.
Seriously?
Mars looks back at the guy.
"We can take you through the teleporter on the base and you can tell him what you think in person."
"Listen if you have a problem with how we run things around here, you're welcome to talk to my superiors."
Bust a nu- what the fuck?
Mars turns to Uti.
The soldier dude frowns.
Bull shit. If you were, we wouldn't have had to chase down that truck and kill the guys who stole it.
"That's what we're here for."
Like the only reason he'd need something like that is to protect himself, right?
Tibe is sweating, fidgeting a little.
But like, he was only trying to protect himself, I mean the only reason we're here is because one of his trucks got stolen.
Mars frowns.
"We would have arrested him and anyone else we found here and brought them back to the installation for questioning."
What were you going to do if it was some militia crap?
Wait, what?
"We had suspected he may have been harboring militia forces, but it appears we were wrong." The right one says, "We're sorry for bothering you, reticles."
Uh.

Pretty fuckin lame.
She's got like a Roenjard friend, and all he does now is complain about New Avalon.
I heard Jan talking about it.
Police to do that shit.
Normally you'd have like...
They just found and returned a stolen truck that had been carrying a shipment of money to the city's major banking system.
This didn't really feel like a mission for monad.
So like.
Mars blows even more on it.
Like someone took a block of chocolate and melted it in a half cup of milk.
It's also incredibly thick.
Mars blows on the hot chocolate.
He quickly backs out of the room.
"This is nothing."
"No, thank you!"
Thank you.
Mars accepts his cup
Their host, Tibe, comes in with a cup of hot chocolate for each of them.
They just completed a small mission.
They're in a log cabin on Roen-heib.
Mars and Uti are sitting around a fire pit.

Aradia sighs happily.
She presses her back to the door.
Aradia closes her door.

Aradia nods.
Mars nods.
yeah! just, uh, stay safe.

She opens it up and Mars heads through.

Aradia nods softly.
You'd like her.
She's really sweet when it counts.

He chews.
Mars shoves a piece of potato in his mouth.
Oh jeez.
I mean.
She's fine!
No! She is though!
......she d0esn't s0und very appreciative.

Mars sighs a bit.
So like I guess it won't ever be as big of a deal to Veruvi.
An amazing chef. I can't compare.
Like honestly her mom is like.
Mars shrugs even harder.
But that was really the only time I did.
One time we went on a camping trip with uti, and I cooked there!
Sometimes.
There wasn't really ever a reason for me to.
So like.
I learned how to cook from uh.. her mom, actually.
Mars shrugs.

we're running!
gogogogogogogogogo!
lets get the fuck outta here!
go go go go go!
Everyone piles into the ship.
She stays there.
Kisket trips and lands on the floor.
Tracy shoves Kisket in.
They run all the way back to the ship.
The hole they left through is now a flaming spout of death.
Kisket climbs out, followed by Tracy.
that's becuase you're fucking piss drunk kisket.
None of you saw it, but I did.
He did the yellow glowy thing there.
It lands twelve yards away.
The rock flies off its hinges about twenty feet in the air.
Raros punches the rock.
There is a large rock at the top of the ladder.
She destroys furniture and stuff, but not the base's structure.
The ceiling now has a large charred spot on it.
It doesn't do anything, but it was worth a try.
Everything is on fire.
The explosions rip through the hangar.
Idrethal frowns.
Until a charge lands on his face.
And again.
And again.
Then he shoots her again.
Idrethal shoots her.
She flies into the side of the ship.
He pulls it from her hands and kicks her in the chest.
Idrethal catches her by the sword.
Talis jumps at Idrethal.
"AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!"
She draws her sword.
Talis jumps on top of one of the ships.
Tracy helps Kisket up the stairs.
But the ones around the fringes of the ships are still working.
Most of the charges are caught in the blast.
He tosses an emp grenade on the floor between all the ships.
Idrethal dodges.
"Who did this?"
"...What the fuck."
He looks at all the charges.
Idrethal steps out of the back door to the hangar.
"But I'm still more badass."
"Only if you say I'm way more badass than her."
"You stuck up, fucking hypocrite, BIIIITCH!!!!"
"Telling ME about being self-righteous?!!"
"You were the one in there, talking about how cool you were, and all the shit you've been through, and how that pirate had to give you a million fucking credits!"

Talis is still tied up.
Kisket leaves.
"My hero."
Kisket drops the bullet unceremoniously on Talis' stomach.
Kisket pulls out the bullet with a pair of tweezers.
Talis nods at Kisket.
Edited previous message: You've got a bullet embedded in your shoulder. I'm gonna take it out.
"You've got a bullet embedded in your shoulder. I'm gonna take it out."
Kisket shooshes her.
"Oh my... Who are you?"
Talis' eyes flutter open.
Then she runs over to Talis and heals her as well.
She pushes Tracy out of the way and heals Shanta.
Kisket nods and runs over.
you okay shanta?
bitch what the fuck are you doing?
Tracy narrows his eyes at Raros.
He drops.
He ricochets an entrobounce shot off the ceiling and it catches the right guy in the center of his head.
[Tracy rolls a 1 for math on the right guy.]
I'm fucking saving Shanta first!
Tracy sprints after him.
raros why do you have scissors?
Jesus fuck which asshole did this?
Kisket stumbles down the rest of the stairs, rushes over and heals the two of them.
Veruvi is bleeding profusely from two bullet wounds to her chest.

Kisket looks down.
Tracy hops over the railing.
They look just in time to see four people being dragged in chairs, kicking and screaming from the door in the back of the room, past a pair of ships and in through the door on the left.
They look out over the hangar.

The shot echoes throughout the room, but the three dude's heads pop open one at a times.
Tracy looks at Raros.
They are totally engrossed in the film.
There are three pirates sitting on the couch in here.
The first left room is another break room, with a large flatscreen TV.
He's out cold.
Tracy looks over at the guy on the couch.
you're into some weird shit dude.
but apparently you like seeing her drunk off her ass.
it was gonna be for kisket.
Edited previous message: Tracy reaches for the coffee pot.
Tracy fills the cup with coffee.
He finds one.
Tracy looks through the cabinets for a paper cup.
That door leads to a break room, There's a pirate guard taking a nap on a couch, and a pot of coffee being kept warm in the coffee machine.
The balcony heads around the entire hangar, but the two stairs leading up to it are both in the center of the left and right sides of the room.
The three of them haven't been noticed yet.
Pirates run back and forth loading and unloading crates, cleaning up spills and refueling the ships.
huh.
yeah
that had the crocodile and the racoon dude
that's that ship
hey.
There are three four ships, two of which are landing ships, one, Tracy recognizes, and the last one is almost totally spherical.
The  staircase leads to a balcony overhanging an underground hangar.
They head down another staircase.
Fuck you I can do straight if I want.
the second right.
lets go right.
Lets just go straight.
I don't care.
There's a single door at the back of the room and two doors on either side.
There are couches and tables in the indent.
There's a large walkway around an indent in the floor with stairs heading inward.
They head down the stairs and find themselves in something of a foyer.
Kisket follows Tracy.
Tracy shrugs and follows him.
I count backwards from nine hundred in threes.
Am not.
Like every single time.
All the time!
You get drunk on the job and nobody shoots you...
Kisket pouts.
YOURS!!!
And who's fault is that?!
You took my water bottle!
I should be middle fingering you!
Why the extra hate for me?
dude what the fuck.
He hears the mechanical squeal of machinery trying and failing to hold itself together.
Raros lifts the rock.
what are you doing?
...
there was like
Tracy rolls a 14 for intelligence.
There are no important features on it right now.
The rock is covered almost entirely by snow.
yeah it only makes sense.
Kisket is slowly walking through the trees.
The tracks stop there.
Raros and Tracy arrive at a boulder.

Kisket carefully picks her way through the snow.
Tracy runs off after the tracks.
Kisket lets fucking go!
what the fuck!
wait why didn't i see those!
why the fuck would those be you?!
Tracy looks at what Raros is looking at.
what?
They weren't hard to find.
Raros finds the tracks.
He walks straight past the tracks. Twice.
[Tracy rolls a 17 for finding tracks.]
fine, fuck it, i'll go find the tracks.
Kisket blatantly ignores that.
Whoever frees her first gets firsts.
So we gotta fight the ninjas to free Shanta.
Edited previous message: no. by fucking ninjas.
no. buy fucking ninjas.
By what? Pirates?
Kisket scoffs.
Kisket reaches into her pocket for her water bottle, but it is no longer there.
It's like my specialty.
Did I ever tell you that I'm really good at finding people?
I'll do it.
Clearly you guys need me to show you the way again.
Kisket rolls her eyes.
Some snow.
That's it?
so what'd you find when you were looking around, raros?
yeah but it was a bank we already owned.
Weren't you the one who convinced us to rob a bank?
is it?
unless like new avalon is some pirate shit.
or pirates.
like monad.
and stealing is only okay when you're stealing from bad guys.
that's called stealing
no.
Or anything else for that matter?
You're not gonna take the key?
He leaves the key in the drawer.
Tracy puts it back.
some kind of shitty cartoon character?
what is this?
Both look well worn....
The plush toy is a giant headed version of the same character.
She has curly hair that's way too long and a grin that looks kind of stupid, and she's holding a sword that's as tall as she is.
The action figure is of this girl in some high tech looking armor.
An action figure and a plush toy?

Tracy tries out the keys on all the drawers.
Tracy waves the crest into the air.
hey raros, you know what this is?
Tracy finds a pair of keys and a New Avalon Orbital Knight's crest.
Tracy rolls a 2 for investigating the pod.
What a profound revalation.
Raros notices that the planet has snow on it.
Tracy heads over to that.
The clearing is devoid of people, there's some weird grey pod thing sitting in a pile of snow.
That's mostly because Kisket spent nearly as much time falling into the snow as she did walking.
It takes fifteen minutes to make it to the clearing with the downed tree.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pirate leads them down.
A staircase leads underground where the boulder used to sit.
It's held up by mechanical hinges.
He punches in a code and the boulder begins to raise above the ground.
The pirate wipes some snow off the boulder to reveal a keypad.
They walk for a while until they find a large boulder.
Veruvi and Talis follow as well.
"Stay in a straight line and follow me." he says, sounding a little bit less energetic.
After waiting thirty seconds, the pirate groans very audibly and starts heading out of the clearing.
Everyone waits.
He waits.
"Please let me shoot this fucker."
He raises his radio to his mouth.
The pirate stares at Talis.
"Why would you say something like that?"
"Like your mother that's fucking?" Talis raises an eyebrow.
"I swear on my fucking mother."
"If you fucking move an inch out of line, we'll melt you with plasma bolts before you can say 'whoops'"

Kisket carefully picks her way back through the snow.
Alright. Lets go.
you saw it?
It's north.
It was incredibly hard to see.
It's not really that tall.
Raros sees a tree fall over.
You're not smart like me. You wouldn't know these things.
I told you Tracy, that was a fucking avalanche.
if you haven't, we could probably just follow that huge boom sound that came from up north.
have you seen anything yet?
not the right thing to say to the guy right now.
that's.
You look really stupid right now.
Kisket looks up at Raros in the tree.
---------------------------------------------------------
Did y9u see it?
Veruvi radios Raros.
Fine.
9h is that the new thing?
We're n9t just g9nna m9ve n9w???

The tree shoots to the left and falls amongst the other trees.
Because Dir circled the tree in explosives.
She walks over to everyone else.
She sheathes a sword at her hip and slings her rifle over her shoulder.
Talis finds whatever she was looking for in the pod.
Veruvi gets on her radio and makes the call.
"Now not only are you a pirate impersonator, but you're an environment hating bigot too?"

"Ugh."

Veruvi frowns.
She sort of grumbles to herself as she does so.
She opens it up and rummages around inside.
Talis heads over to her drop pod.
"We're lost as fuck dude." Comes the reply.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracy pushes his head deeper into his hands.
We're lost as fuck, dude.
She pushes the talk button.
She looks Raros in the eye.
Kisket raises the radio to her mouth.
Kisket picks up her radio.
"Kisket where are you, over."
"Kisket!" It says.
Kisket's radio comes to life.
Tracy puts his face in his hands.
Whyyyy.
Kisket reaches meekly for the bottle.
It's vodka.
No. Of course I'm not.
She takes a sip of water.
Kisket pulls out her water bottle.
Am I?
Was I?
you were following tracks earlier
arent any tracks here.
there.
Yeah cause Dir probably spun around it. You know that girl walks strange.
It's like my specialty.
I'm good at finding people.
Nah I'm definitely sure they're somewhere around here.
Kisket leads them in a circle around a tree.
They've been heading south for 20 minutes.
So I'm pretty sure they turned here and went this way after that....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Duh!"
"And then report back!"
"With my sick sword!"
"Kill 'em!"
"I was gonna fucking!"
"Because you were pirates earlier!"
"What the fuck do you mean move?!"
"And its your fault!"
"So the mission's a fucking bust."
"And now I called down my gear and all the pirates know I'm here."
"But YOUUUU decided to go and shoot me! And scare me! Like an asshole!"
"I was supposed to stay hidden and observe and report back on all the locations and operations of all the pirates here so New Avalon can send in a strike team to root out the pirate scum without causing harm to the nearby citezens."
"Fuck you, you fucking ruined my entire mission!"
"No."
Talis stands up.
"No."
Talis frowns.
"AAAAAHHH!!!!!"
Talis sort of falls over and rolls.
"FUCK YOU!!!"

"Like I said, you wont get a genaviven out of me. So you might as well give up now."

The person rolls a 16 for getting up.
Veruvi's jaw drops.
Dir shoots her shotgun and blows Veruvi's carefully rolled snowman base to to chunks and dust.
Shanta dives, but her feet get caught in the snow and she faceplants as well.
Then the person begins to flail and shout into the snow as they try to push themselves upright.
There's exactly two secons where nothing happens.
Shanta dives out of the way, and the person flops into the snow.
Shanta.
For.
Straight.

Veruvi is rolling a ball of snow as she trudges on.
Every once in a while there might be a berry or two, poking out from beneath the snow.
It's all very pretty.
There's snow, there's rocks, and there's trees.
There's very little to see.

They head into the forest.
Kisket starts following the tracks of very obviously disturbed snow.
They headed this way.
Okay.
Nice.
Responsible.
Kisket looks at Raros.
Once or twice.
when the fuck have you ever talked to veruvi?
Knowing Veruvi, She probably went to go make snow angels with Dir.
Actually scratch that.

Kisket watches it fly a ways then fall into the snow.
You want to try some?
It's some good water.
Sorting out your guy issues or whatever.
Kisket takes another sip of her water.
You looked busy.
Kisket shrugs.
but didn't say anything?
you watched them?
Tracy narrows his eyes.
I watched them head Northeast.
Kisket shrugs.
I don't know. Maybe two or three minutes ago.
how long?
what????
Hey, Shanta, Dir, and Veruvi left like... a little bit ago.
Then she decides to tell them.
She watches Tracy and Raros argue for a bit.

Veruvi pulls Dir 9ver t9 Shanta.
Cm9n!
I'm g99d. Lets gra6 Shanta, ditch all these guys and g9 make s9me sn9wmen.
Hey.
Dir.
Hey.
Veruvi walks up to Dir.
Kisket leans against one of the trees.
She puts it back in her pocket.
Kisket closes the water bottle.
Kisket takes a long drink of water.
She looks at Tracy and Raros.
Kisket opens the water bottle.
She pulls out a water bottle.
Kisket digs in her pockets.
Tracy shifts around impatiently.
or are you seriously about to make a tree blanket?
c'mon it's fucking cold. lets stop standing around.
lets get going.
you know, soft, cuddly... a little gay maybe?
[Tracy rolls a 3 for charisma.]
sounds like your kind of thing.
make a blanket with it.
why not like
cool.
He notices that the tree trunks look incredibly stringy, and fiberous. they look pretty soft, too.
Raros looks at a tree.
Kisket's bored as hell.
Veruvi watches Dir and grins internally.
or.
lets go.
okay.
It's much quieter than a place filled with pirates should be.
Wind whistles through pine needles.
They hit the entrance of the forest.
They head down a small path down the cliff face.
just get going then.
lets uh.
This sh9uld 6e a walk in the park.
It's practically 9ur thing.
Fuck, we fight pirates like weekly.
We've f9ught pirates 6ef9re.
maybe underground too, tobin wasn't super sure.
so the pirates are hiding somewhere in that forest.
alright.
The skies are full of thick grey clouds.
Snow is piled atop the trees and beneath, coating every surface in a layer of thick white.
They land on a cliff overlooking a dense conifer forest.
They arrive at Roen-heib.
[Commission 52: One Track Mind]
They take off.
Tracy walks up to the front seat.
I can give you the location on the planet and shit.
we've gotta get to roen-heib
 We're great.
Sup 6itch! H9w's it g9ing?
Shanta, Tracy, Kisket, Raros, Dir, and Veruvi enter Krayna's ship.
------------------------------------------------------------
"You've probably seen it..."
What movie?
"I made a fuckton of money off my last movie."
Kisket squints.
"...If that's what you guys need." Tobin shrugs.
So like, 500 thousand credits?
"I mean whatever you want really."
"I could do 200 or 250."
Edited previous message: i don't think shanta liked that amount.
i don't think Shanta liked that amount.
Tracy watches her leave.
"Okay, okay, how about a hundred fifty thousand credits?"
so like it works out.
yeah, but like, normally we get paid really well regardless.
"Wow really?"
yeah.... we kind of do.
Tracy frowns.
"Do you?"
Edited previous message: "Like, don't tell me just take them as they come."
"You okay, Shanta?"
"Uh."
"Do you have like, a starting price?"
what?
"How much do I pay you?"
"So."
shanta we can do it right?
definitely.
"Can you take care of my pirate problem on Roen-heib for me then?"
"Eh, Alright I guess."
Tobin thinks for a bit.
that's not a thing.
Tracy shrugs.
"I don't want to have that kind of employer/employee relationship between us that always ends up happening."
"I mean."
"Really?
we can handle that shit.
i mean you're looking at a bunch of kickass bounty hunters right now.
"What?"
we'll do it for you.
"Would that be weird?"
Tobin looks at Shanta.
"Which will be weird."
"Im gonna have to like hire bounty hunters or something."
"I guess I'm gonna have to either handle it myself, but I don't have the time for that these days."
"So like."
"I don't know."
Tracy nods.
"It's just annoying."
"And the whole ordeal could take a month or two, for the sake of 'keeping the galaxy peaceful'."
"And then there's all kinds of procedures and bullcrap."
"It's just that Roen-heib is part of the New Avalon order or whatever. So like, the planet itself can't hold any standing armies, and all military procedures have to be like processed and shit."
"No not at all."
so it's gotta be like a shitton of pirates, right?
literally nothing?
Tobin scratches her head. "And I just got a call from the government there, saying that there's nothing they can do about it."
"There's this place I really want to film at, but it's like really close to where a group of pirates set up a little base."
"It's like an issue on Roen-heib."
"I mean... Okay, so."
Kisket raises an eyebrow.
"Oh, that? Oh... Nothing you need to worry about. Just a pain in the ass situation."
so what were you doing when you ran out.
It was okay.
Kisket shrugs.
"It was excellent!" Qitara smiles. "I love motion pictures."
Tracy frowns.
"See, pretty good, huh? Do I have good taste or what?"
Tobin stands and stretches.
Eventually the movie ends.
Edited previous message: Qitara likes the movie about as much as she'd like fast and furious 15, which is about as much as she'd like Casablanca.

Kisket has been watching Tracy fidget for the past 20 minutes, taking mental notes.
Tobin comes back at the beginning of the climax.
Eventually it starts getting really good.
They watch Construction Obstruction.
But Qitara will like anything.
As is Qitara.
Kisket's into it.
He's hardly even concentrating on the movie anymore.
Tracy's looking pretty concerned.
She doesn't come back.
And she leaves.
About halfway through the movie, Tobin stands up very suddenly, she whispers to Tracy and Shanta sitting next to her that she's going to the bathroom.
Tobin may have surprisingly good taste.
The movie starts off and it's actually pretty good.
The three of them arrive as the opening credits are rolling.
They head inside.
Qitara nods.
What Shanta said.
Yes
Like this is too much.
Edited previous message: Okay lets stop.
"Okay lets stop.
"Everything is a thing."
Is that a thing?
"She could really enjoy constantly turning him down, though."
There's no way you secretly have a gigantic crush on Tracy.
Okay I'm done, sorry.
Kisket laughs.
Probably.
Qitara giggles and covers her mouth.
Kisket wiggles her eyebrows.
"It can really only mean one of two things."
Which means...........
And that's not okay with Shanta......
So she's got a crush on Tracy...
Wait, stop getting distracted.
I like it a lot.
It's a very funny show.
Edited previous message: "I've watched far too much New Girl recently."
"Blame Kisket."
"I've watched far too much new girl recently."
"Excuse me I thought we were supposed to be making fun of her."
Qitara chuckles.
"And her shoes. my god."
"That hat did not match that dress, for one."
Me neither.
Kisket shrugs.
So what's your problem with Tobin, Shanta?
Fair.
Oh.
Kisket inclines her head.
"Nothing. Yours are great, mine don't exist."
But seriously Qitara, what's so uncomfortable about boobs? I like talking about boobs.
I wouldn't know.
"I'm uncomfortable with this line of conversation."
There's something to be said for boobs.
I mean.
I mean.
It's because she's cute.
He fucking disappeared every time she entered his eyesight.
We all saw what happened after the incident with him and Elesa.
I mean.
"If he had an Idea he'd be a complete mess."
I'm totally sure.
I guess.
I mean.
But yeah.
I concede.
Kisket looks at the two of them.
"No you were worse, Kisket."
Even I'm not that bad.
That was disgustingly blatant.
"Well, obviously, yeah," Qitara grins.
Kisket nods.
Kisket closes her mouth.
Kisket was about to say something.
Edited previous message: They disappear behind a corner.
They dissappear behind a corner.
Tobin tugs Tracy through the front doors.
"FUCK WE'RE MISSING THE PREVIEWS."
"It's wild how pretty the place is though."
"Yeah just straight up."
"I've heard people say that's the best planet in the galaxy."
"This was made by this director from Beaumare."
"Nahhhh"
okay that's awkward.
"He fuckin has me beat by a mile."
"And then however many times afterward."
"Tracy saw Hojart twelve times in theaters."
"Nah."
"Yup."
Five?
"It's great I've seen it like five times now."
Edited previous message: "Anyway lets go, the movie's about to start."
anyway lets go, the movie's about to start.
"Nice to meet all of you, I've heard some as well." Tobin smiles.
Kisket waves and qitara smiles.
that's shanta by the way, and this is kisket and qitara.
Tracy shrugs.
"Hi! I didn't know Tracy talked about me?"
Tobin's pretty short, with four fingers, long necked, but she hunches her shoulders a bit.
tobin what's up?
Tracy leads them over to Tobin.
Edited previous message: hey that's her!
Hey that's her.
She waves to Tracy.
It's wearing a sundress and a nice straw hat.
The hair is tied into a braid in front of it's chest.
It has long black droopy ears, and dark hair that runs down its spine.
They see a white, almost canine looking alien by the box office.
Tracy doesn't notice.
Kisket's not even hiding how she's looking for Tobin.
Tracy leads them all to the theater.
They get going.
Okay lets get going. I really want to meet Tobin too.
Qitara nods.
It was a joke by the way.
He took that joke worse than I thought he would.
Kisket frowns.
Tracy goes through the teleporter.
that doesn't even matter we're gonna be fuckin late!
Tracy shakes his head.
Joke?
Tracy frowns.
that's not a funny joke.
seriously.
Qitara keeps her lips sealed.
Nah you definitely said it.
i seriously didn't fucking say that.
i didn't say that you bitch!!!
And that he wanted us to film it.
He said he was gonna ask you to be his date to the wedding at this movie.
"Wow, Tracy actually convinced you to come?"
They meet Kisket and Qitara by the teleporters.
okok lets go!
Two minutes later Tracy is back.
Tracy leaves.
Edited previous message: Two minutes.
Edited previous message: we're leaving in like
Edited previous message: well get ready
Tracy looks at Uti.

kisket's coming, with qitara.

we gotta go quick!
do you still wanna see a movie?!
sHANTA!
Tracy pops into Shanta's room.
Mars walks backwards toward the hallway.
You never know what they might do.
Just in case that raptor starts walking around...
But I'm gonna go into Veruvi's room and lock the door.
Alright.
Mars narrows his eyes.
Can we leave?
You ready to leave?
Mars rubs his face.
I don't know what WALL is.
And I had a twenty minute conversation about WALL procedure.
I met a dude.
Mars looks at Uti.
He looks like he lost something precious.
Mars walks up the stairs from the training room.
Voracious screams more for good measure.
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH"
"GET THE FUCK OUT"
"GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE"
"WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?"
"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?"
"WHAT THE FUCK."
"What in the FUCK?!"
"I'll be around."
"Yeaah for suree."
"Good luck."
Edited previous message: "Or something..."
"Or something...
"You've got fuckin' balls of iron..."
"Yeah, go for it."
Liz drops her leg.
Liz lifts her leg instead.
Liz tries to shrug but realizes that it's too hard in her current position on the floor.
"And I'm too scared to go in, and everyone ignores him so it's not like I can find someone to follow in there."
"And like he apparently never leaves his room."
"Me too, there's one guy."
"Have you met everyone yet?"
"Same here, this place is pretty cool."
"How's it goin'?"
"Sup."
She props her head up on her hand.
Edited previous message: Liz rolls over.
"Liz rolls over."
"Ahk! Shit!"
Liz flails around for a moment, then falls off her bed.
"He- GAH!" Liz's bubble gum falls out of her mouth and onto her nose.
Liz is chewing bubble gum.
She flashes Uti a peace sign as he walks in.
Liz is lying half upside-down off her bed.
Liz's room is empty save for a single bed.
Mars is missing.
alrighty, see you around.
Tracy is holding back a grin to appear cool.
Tracy offers his fist.
you're the man.
but i fuckin like you dude.
you know, i wasn't sure at first.
Tracy nods for no discernible reason.
no prob.
yeah.
no that one's actually fucking golden.
no...
Tracy scratches his chin.
...
Tracy shrugs.
okay.
my name is a girls name.
look
that's a pretty good name.
wow.
if he's like.
you know.
Edited previous message: or maybe, "I bet you can't fit your hand in me."
or maybe "I bet you can't fit your hand in me."

it'd be safe to assume you're surrounded by hot girls, amirite?
so like.
you're one of those monad guys, everyone lives in one place right?
dude.
okay.
...
okay.
okay.
He looks around, sees Shanta walking off, appreciates Shanta walking off, then slams his door shut.
Tracy walks to the hallway.
Tracy beckons Uti inside.
yes.
i mean.
you do?
no way.
you do?
yeah lets go with that actually.
Tracy frowns a little at first.
nothing really.
um.
pretty okay!
it's uh.
oh! uti! hey!
Tracy looks up again.
Tracy keeps texting.
what the fuck?
Tracy looks up.
His feet are on his table while he types rapidly on his phone.
Tracy's sitting at his desk.
Mars retires to the couch.
Don't let us stop you my man.
Well go, go, keep touring.
Mars frowns.
Edited previous message: M&lt; I didn't say that.

Sirie waves.
Okay?
Lets not talk about fucking raptors.
This is a cool place.
They're in the other room.
Veruvi and Sirie brought me over.
Ayy, I thought I saw you walk over here.
Mars pokes his head into the hallway.
Kisket and Qitara wave, then quickly head off to their own rooms.
Yeah, but he looks like that to everyone.
Kisket nods.
It fits though.
"He's a cool guy."
Qitara giggles a bit.
"That's john."
Good job.
I'm surprised he didn't start talking about wall.
Cypress leaves his meat and protein powder sandwich on the table and heads downstairs.
"I'm just gonna go do some push-ups."
Cypress shakes his head.
"Why would anyone call themselves something like that?"
He's got a really big forehead.
He wipes his forehead.
Cypress has to put his sandwich down.
"Like what?!"
"I'm Cypress, what's yours?"
"Oh."
"Why are you just..."
He brings it up for another bite.
Then lowers the sandwich.
Cypress takes another bite.
As if it were a weight.
He's lifting his sandwich.
It looks like...
Cypress takes another bite of his sandwich.
"Suit yourself."
"Everything you need for a good meal."
"And protein powder."
"It's packed full of protein."
"You sure you don't want a manwich?"
"I can fix you a manwich."
"Oh have you eaten yet?"
"Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle."
"Good."
"Do you work out?"
"I didn't know Shanta had a brother."
"No way."
He switches back and forth a few times.
He looks back and forth between Shanta and Uti.
Cypress squints.
"And thanks!"
"Oh, hey, what's up man," Cypress says with his mouth full.
He notices them come in.
Cypress takes a giant bite of his massive sandwich.
It's fucking massive.
Cypress is munching on a sandwich.
Cypress is sitting on the couch.
Yeah...
"It's alright."
"Small world, I guess?"
"You must have been one of the reticles Yvelte asked for..."
"Big alligator aliens killed him?"
You're not talking about Luden, are you?
... What?
"I definitely do."
Qitara nods.
"Nicely done."
Okay?
Oh...
It's all good.
Kisket
"I'm Qitara, it's wonderful to meet you as well."
She and Qitara stand up.
Kisket smiles.
Kisket and Qitara are sitting on a bench.
Shanta, Kisket and Qitara are waiting at Grroas Park in the Baluster.
The next day rolls in.
-------------------------------------------------------
She puts the headphones back in.
Tracy shooshes her immediately.
Liz takes her headphones out and opens her mouth.
She grins.
"If it comes down to it, just lie." Kisket says.
"Just. Lie." Kisket whispers to Shanta.
Are we gonna get paid for any of this?
If Dapeo is kidnapped...
So....
Kisket thinks aloud.
Edited previous message: "Nothing." Tracy waves it off.
nothing Tracy waves it off.
i promised tobin i'd be there at 4.
look i don't know about you guys but i've got to see this movie anyway.
Kisket waves as well.
Mars waves.
See y'all in a bit.
Alrighty.
Mars hups dapeo over his shoulder.
Tracy frowns.
Kisket smiles.
or something?
do you all wanna see a movie?
Tracy's eyes are still narrowed.
I see that my jokes are not welcome.
Alright.
Tracy's eyes remain narrowed.
If Shanta says you're a fuckwad, that carries a little weight of its own.
But like.
I'm just kidding.
Tracy's eyes narrow.
Well, I didn't say that
i'm not a fuckwad, thank you.
i get it.
Seriously.
Like
I didn't mean to say that you were a fuckwad or anything.
Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you're a fuckwad man.
Oh thank god.
Tracy is a little taken aback.
Is it you!?
Mars looks at Tracy.
Is she dating some fuckwad?
That's not funny!
Mars' hand flies to his forehead.
Oh god.
Like, holy fuck what if she's dating someone...
It's been a while though. I don't know what I'm gonna say.
My girlfriend... from Earth.
She's like.
Tracy elbows Liz.
"Who's Veruvi?"
Edited previous message: Holy fuck.
Holy fuc.
I...
Mars looks stunned, then confused, then very conflicted, then stunned again.
Like, every day? Where is she?
You haven't seen Veruvi, have you?
Shanta...
And.
We'll come hang out.
Yeah!
We need to complete our mission first...
We won't know unless we try.
...I guess.
...Yeah.
like you've got no idea.
to have shanta be this happy all the time
but it'd be fucking awesome.
and excuse me for butting in.
i mean.
Or the super devil.
He's like the fuckin devil.
You gotta be careful about guys like him.
He might have been playing you.
And apparently the guy who killed us went rogue.
It's kind of a big deal.
JUST for us.
Like they literally created a way to bring dead people back to life like.
And it's not like it's just a simple process too.
We kind of owe them.
It's like...
They've done a lot for us, you know?
Mars frowns.
They're gonna respawn though.
We beat all his guards and took him out singlehandedly. It was pretty sick.
Yeah.
Cool right?
Mars picks him up.
Nah.
Who, him?
Edited previous message: Uh, yeah.
Uh, yeah.
Edited previous message: Mars looks at Dapeo.
Mars looks at Deapio.
Mars stands up.
"Sup dude."
Liz giggles.
Tracy narrows his eyes.
He kisses her hand.
And hello beautiful.
Mars gets down on one knee and takes Liz's hand in both of his.
Mars brofists Tracy.
Hey there, Tracy.
Well.
Mars nods.
Dude, I would have thought they were brother and sister.
Mars squints.
Mars pats Kisket on the shoulder and heads over to Tracy.
Tracy frowns.
"That was a weird question to open up with."
"I'm his cousin, by the way."
my. what???
...
"Nope, Tracy's too much of a pussy to ask me out."
Liz smiles back.
same here, man.
Tracy takes the hand.
Kisket pats Mars on the shoulders.
nah.
totally someone else.
nope.
that was another dude.
nope.
Uh...
Kisket steps back, then hugs Mars.
Kisket gives Uti a hug.
Mars waves too.
Kisket steps forward.
Liz waves.
hey guys.
Tracy nods.
Kisket's got her arms around the shoulders of Tracy and Liz.
Mars nods.
It's really good to see you.
Mars grins.
He twists a little bit, to and fro.
Mars hugs the hell out of Shanta.
Mars lies Dapeo down, gently.
Shanta!!!
Kisket falls back to admire the reunion with Tracy and Liz.
Edited previous message: Mars smiles.
He folds his arms.
Mars looks down at them, then at the rest of the team.
oh.
What's up?
Tracy and Liz follow the two of them.
Kisket follows.
Kisket nods.
Kisket frowns.
We should get back if only just to check.
Maybe she respawned.
Soul out of her body?
What happened?
Edited previous message: Kisket doesn't say anything.
Kismet doesn't say anything.
Tracy gets the memo and pulls his cousin away.
Kisket shoos Tracy and Liz away.
She pulls Shanta into a hug.
Kisket rushes to Shanta's side.
Kisket frowns.
...
Is she okay?
absolutely not.
"Fuckin' count me in." Liz smiles wildly.
"I've never been so fucking terrified in my life."
"F U C K."
"H o l y."

Kismet's at the tunnel entrance.
Tracy and Liz follow.
Tracy follows Liz.
Liz sprints after Shanta
Tracy scrambles to his feet.
He punches the Saccharum's arm and breaks his wrist.
Tracy glows and becomes incredibly solid.
fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck!
Tracy begins to fly around the Saccharum, hitting him repeatedly with very little effect.
He kicks the Saccharum in the head and it does....... nothing?
He runs straight at the Saccharum, looking as if he could be in four places at once. He jumps!
it becomes impossible to tell where tracy ends and the oxium glow begins.
The blur effect quickly covers Tracy's entire body.
He starts to become blurry at the edges, where the grey glow begins.
Tracy begins to run at high speeds!
I WANNA DIEEE
AND I DELETED TRACY's wall of text explaining his powers
I WAS TRYNA COPY PASTE
AAAAAAAAAAA
check this stupid shit out
ay
He charges The Saccharum
Tracy glows gray.
The beat's flowing through his veins.
Tracy doesn't even hear that part.
go out with me.
if we live.
shanta.
who???
wat?
"Oh my god he's so scary."
"He was," Liz says between gasps of breath, "right behind me."
Liz slams the door behind her.
Or four.
Or two.
I also want to see a medic.
Lets get the fuck outta here.
Right.
Mars frowns.
Hah, we could just kill them again.
Then he goes back to firing the cannon.
He pulls a pistol from his belt and shoots Mars four times in the abdomen.
Xerpin looks at Mars.
[Mars rolls a 16.]
Hey man, can I have a turn?
Mars walks over to Xerpin.
That does not look good.
Ooh.
Edited previous message: Xerpin is having a blast shooting the cannon.

Mars talks about random bullshit as he follows Uti.
You can't interrupt it with something as trivial as a radio call.
Poker is a very serious activity.
Totally possible.
Maybe they're busy?
Hmm.
Lets try heading outside.
No reception?
What's up?
Mars goes and picks up his forehead drawing pen.
Yeah sure.
...
I don't think I could have fought that thing.
Nice one.
Wow. That worked.
Edited previous message: Yeah see, that's not a, 'I'm about to not kill you guys,' growl
Yeah see, that's not a, 'I'm about to not kill you guys, growl'
Yo I think you're making him mad...
What the fucking fuck is that fucking thing?
Then back at Hydrin.
Mars looks at Fuelia.
Mars looks for the first time at Hydrin.
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING, DIDJA???!
GOTCHYA BITCH!
WHOPAAAH!
Then kicks at the last second!!!!
He swings his fist!
Mars is already going full tilt.
Mars jumps into the air, his fist glows with shimmery black power.
As his shouting reaches peak volume, he turns and runs in a zig zag straight for Fuelia.
[Mars rolls a 12.]
Mars is just shouting at the top of his lungs now, definitely preparing to do something absolutely crazy.
He looks directly in Fuelia's eyes and starts shouting.
Mars makes wide motions with his arms.
Now I have you right where I want you.
Surprised???
Hah!
He hops to his feet like nothing happened.

Mars does three accidental backflips and lands on his stomach.
Mars flies into the air.
This hole opens up in the floor a couple feet behind Loop and Fuelia.
Mars panics and creates another hole beneath him.
He's spinning wildly.
Mars slides through, and falls from the ceiling.
Mars creates a portal that is beneath the upper half of his body.
[Mars rolls a 17 to use his oxium.]
Mars shrugs.
Mars frowns.
He rolls over to Uti.
Mars drops like a fly.
Mars drops the pen and runs over to Uti.
At least let him put his hands up what the fuck?!
Dude!
It wasn't gonna be a dick, I swear.
Mars still has his pen poised to draw.
Then he erases the drawing.
Then he draws a dick on his face.
Mars takes his crown off his head.
Sup, your majesty.
Lets go.
I'd say we go left, just for the hell of it, but we don't really have a third opinion to settle the argument.
So what's the plan, man?
Mars walks up the stairs.
It fuckin worked.
You saw how fucking captivated those rebel fuckers were.
I'm being alluring and mysterious.
"Hey man, don't tell me to-" Maverick 22 stops talking as she notices the shadowy figure.
Mav stomps over.
"See anything?" Mav shouts from the other room.
"Guys I love this thing."
Xerpin fires the cannon.

Mav sighs.
"Oh... Well if you insist, who am I to try and stop you?"
"No please you really don't have to!"
"No, no, stop, don't go for me." Mav says.
Maverick 22 stands there and pretends she didin't think she heard anything.
"Whatever it was probably nothing anyway."
"I don't wanna fucking do that shit." Mav frowns.
[Mav rolls an 8 for charisma.]
"Go check it out."
"Mine hallway. Think I heard something."
"Ay." Mav says to Auto.
Tracy frowns.

She sees The Saccharum out of the corner of her eye.
Liz turns her head.
Liz is screaming bloody murder.
Liz screams it from the stairs.
"RUUUNNN!!!!"
Liz bolts.
"Fucking run away!!!!"

He looks at the shield controls.

Tracy walks up to the shield controls.
Kisket half cries and half whimpers.
Kisket is mortified.
[Kisket rolls a 14.]
She instinctively whips out the injector and charges the nearest guard.
Kisket is surprised and incredibly scared by this new development.
[She rolls a 15 to shoot the guard.]
Kisket instead pulls out her gun.
She is visibly shaken.
Kisket puts away the injector.
Tracy enters the next room.
Uhh.
Kisket frowns.
[Kisket rolls a 5 for injection.]
Kisket runs out and injects the closest guy.

[Tracy rolls a 4 for charisma]
[Kisket moves one more and rolls a 7 to shoot the guard north of her.]
Kisket is dumbfounded.
She looks at the very dead Raros.
Kisket walks to the corner and peeks around.
Tracy runs max toward the door.
Tracy's mouth drops for the second time in twenty seconds.
Tracy is totally out of it.
And just stay there.
They both eventually touch the sides of his head.
They continue to raise anyway.
Tracy starts to raise both hands, but quickly realizes he doesn't know what he's going to do with them.
[Kisket moves 5 away from Raros]
Tracy stares at Raros.
Raros... stop...
Tracy looks at Raros, slack-jawed.
Tracy looks at Raros.
you can save a life today
please man please
Tracy jumps around.
i'm like literally about to shit my pants here, like they told me the bathroom is in here, but nobody will talk to me and help me out!
dude you HAVE to help me!
Tracy runs up to the guard.
[Tracy rolls a 18 for wisdom and a 3 for charisma.]
[Tracy moves 2.]
[Kisket moves three spaces as well.]
[Tracy moves max.]
lets just go turn off those shields.
Tracy rolls his eyes.
Like a lot more than I thought it'd be.
It's a lot of fun though.
Fiiine.
Fine.
Fine, fine.
Tracy silently pleads.
Tracy looks at Kisket.
Kisket looks at Tracy.
holy shit you don't know how much of a relief it is to hear you say that.
Tracy sighs.
and i mean don't get me wrong, i like her, but this is pretty much exactly what i was afraid of happening.
and now i have to help her cause i'm the "best big cousin a girl could ever ask for" or some shit.
and spent all her fucking money on food like an idiot

but like can we tone it down around liz please?

"Okay."
Liz frowns.
"For the record, I really am sorry for making fun of you."
"Uhm, Iri?"
Liz frowns.
Liz doesn't say anything.
Liz scoots as far away as possible from Iri.
Liz squeaks and falls on her ass.

Then at Iri.
Liz looks at the machine.
Liz whistles.
"Uh- I... Oh."
The guard is already dead.
Liz pops out from the stairs, gun raised.
[Liz rolls a 4 for shooting the radio out of radio guard's hand.]
"Oh shit!"
Liz ducks beneath the stairs for cover.
She follows Shanta.
Liz shrugs back.
Kisket frowns and follows Tracy.
Tracy takes off.

It's just
Kisket's shoulders fall a little.
You might as well have just shot him...
Liz frowns.

She goes with Iri.

Maverick 22 looks at Shanta.
Maverick 22 folds her arms.
Maverick 22 looks at these people.
"I'm not that young, though."
"Well thanks, miss."
He looks like he's obtained a new worldview.
Xerpin nods.
"That's pretty gay."
"And men can objectify men?"
"So you're saying women can objectify women."
Xerpin speaks up.
"So."
Cause he knows better.
I mean, the only time it's an issue is when Tracy does it I think.
Kisket looks at the two of them.
Xerbin raises an eyebrow.
Kisket hits that high five.
But only with Qitara.
Maybe a little.
Kisket rolls her eyes.
Freaks?
Kisket tilts her head.
Freaks.
Freaks?
"Woah," Xerpin says.
I'm sorry.
Man.
Did that happen on Caprivah after we left?
Kisket frowns.
damn.
where's colin when you need him?
Tracy frowns more.
"I guess that makes sense." Liz smiles, "Sucks to be you Trace."
"Huh..." Liz says.
"They really like to rag on you, Tracy..."
Liz snorts a little.
Tracy frowns.
Liz's mouth is opening and closing but words aren't really coming out.
this is like her second day outside of a planet that's entirely human, lets try and keep it simpler...
"Yeah... You too."
this is my cousin liz.
Tracy puts his arm around Liz's shoulders and takes over.
"Uh."
She slowly reaches out.
Liz looks at the hand.
sup.
Hey.
Tracy's internal big brother alarm starts blaring and he notices Liz isn't saying anything.
Of course.
Kisket laughs.
Kisket frowns at that.
Kisket looks too.
Kisket looks at Shanta.
This sounds serious.
Oh.
Liz waves tentatively.
Kisket waves back.
Kisket walks over to Krayna.
Liz frowns.
That actually explains a lot.
Kisket looks at Liz, then at Tracy.
"I'm Tracy's cousin Liz."
Liz laughs.
But apparently you manage to make him quieter than me so like. I don't really know what to do anymore.
So like I've been waiting for Tracy to introduce us.
Kisket walks up to Liz.
Kisket looks at Raros.
Commenting on all the stupid shit everyone's about to do, so that girl over there doesn't think we're completely retarded.
I'm just.
That was a perfectly normal interaction.
Understandable.
Oh, there?
...
Kisket looks at Tracy.
"Nope."
no.
Yes.
Edited previous message: "No problem," Qitara smiles.

That was fast.

Kisket turns over.
Qitara is also on her bed.

Tracy frowns.
"I'll come!" Liz grins.
Tracy shoves his cousin off him and stands up.
oh thank god.
Tracy gives up on the inside.
"What has Tracy been doing?!"
"Wait what?"
Tracy coughs again.
She pushes his face to the side.
Liz puts her hand in Tracy's face.
she's a bitch.
she's my cousin.
Tracy coughs.
"I'm Liz! Tracy's friend, who happens to be a girl, who loves him very much!"
Tracy looks at Shanta.
"They're really great sandwiches by the way," Liz smiles.
Tracy doesn't scoot that much.
Liz sits on Tracy and forces him to scoot to the side.
"Oh... Uh, have fun?"
"Hey, where you going, Pringle?"
Tracy looks at Liz.
She motions for him to scoot over.
Liz walks over to Tracy.
Qitara pours two glasses of water, then quickly leaves the room.
maybe it's important.
what the fuck does he do on his phone?
Qitara walks into the room.
"Oh, I get it."
Tracy decides not to say anything.
Tracy did.
Liz didn't hear.
"Well, obviously!" Liz grins.
Tracy stares at Liz.
She swallows the sandwich.
Liz chews the sandwich.

or elesa, for that matter

Liz stuffs the sandwich into her mouth.

and you said you had lunch like thirty minutes before that.
liz we literally just had lunch like twenty minutes ago.
Liz takes a sandwich.
Tracy walks to the couch and sits down.
Liz walks right up to Polya.
"Cutest person on Zenithon, huh?"
"Oh!"
"Hi."
"Hi Iri!" Liz waves.
"Pleased to meet you as well."
Liz finally puts her foot down.
liz this is elesa.
elesa, this is my cousin liz.
but, whatever.
honestly i figured you'd end up introducing yourself anyway.
i.
He does it again.
Tracy opens and closes his mouth.
"Sooooooooo," The girl says, still standing on one leg, "Aren't you going to introduce your super attractive and generally awesome cousin to everyone, Tracy?"
Tracy can't really find anything to say.
Tracy frowns.
"And he paid, what a gentleman!"
"He had lunch with me!"
The girl clutches Tracy's arm and lifts one leg.
i uh actually just had lunch
oh, hey elesa.
Tracy looks around.

Once Raros is on board, they take off and head back to Zenithon.
It breaks through the clouds and flies away.
In the distance, the thrusters on Vox Mortis' ship ignite, and the ship slowly rises up into the atmosphere.
we had a shitty day is what happened.
Tracy sits next to Raros.
She sits Sirie down, then sits down herself.
Veruvi doesn't answer.
Veruvi's got a new necklace.
Veruvi is helping a very bloody Sirie limp toward the ship.
They wait for twenty minutes before Krayna shows up, and then they play card games until Shanta and the others arrive.
Raros and Kisket make their way back to where they split up on the cliff.

The doors that exit the bridge open and two guards stand by them.
She can't really find anything to say.
Kisket is half staring, half cringing, half standing, half sitting still, in the same exact chair she was in earlier.
"You two better get going."
He waits for a while.
Vox doesn't answer that.

Vox sighs.
"Ludovica understands."

"Which I can't have."
"And then you'll know what my people will be doing."
"Because if you refuse the offer, I'll only find someone else to do it."
"See. I'm not going to answer that question."
"The offer is still out there."
"But, honestly, I'd still like her and her team to work for me."
"If you two weren't friends of Shanta's I would have had you killed on sight."
Vox sighs louder.
Vox puts the mask back on.
"Woof."
He presses his fingertips into small indentations on the helmet, then pulls the mask off.
Vox sighs audibly.
"Why?"
"Nobody's keeping you here."
"If you want to leave you can."
"This is getting annoying."
"Stop."

"Have fixed."
"I wouldn't."
"You think."
Between shots, Vox starts to talk.
Vox keeps getting hit.
He stands there just taking bullets for two minutes as Raros shoots.
He doesn't say anything, or try to stop them from hitting him.
His head rocks back with the impact of each one.
The bullets hit Vox's helmet hard.
It plinks off the back of his helmet.

Vox laughs a little.
Kisket's weird face gets even more strained.
Vox doesn't respond to that.
"I guess I expected too much."
Vox sighs. "I didn't think you were going to be the petty one. "

Vox turns around fully.
He turns his head.
Vox stands a little straighter.
He must be really out of it.
Vox is still facing away from him.
Kisket starts to say something, but nothing comes out.
Staring.
Just.
She's staring at Raros.
Vox hasn't noticed, but Kisket has.
It's got leather padding that makes it really, really comfortable.
It's a fairly normal captain's chair.
There's a stairwell to his right that leads to the main floor of the bridge.
He also spots Kisket sitting in a chair on the left side of the room.

It doesn't budge.
It doesn't feel locked though, just jammed.
It rattles a bit, but the handle is pretty stuck.
It's shut tight.
Eventually he reaches a door that doesn't look like it gets used very often.
He walks for a very long time.
There doesn't seem to be any real way forward.
There are shafts spaced out evenly that head deeper into the ship.
The area is filled with pipes and leavers and electrical wiring.
The left maintenece door leads to a space between the layers of the ship's hull.
The hallway is so long, Raros can't see the end yet.
There is a single maintenance door on either side of the hallway.

There's a little stall door that leads into a hallway dividing the male and female sections of the spa.
The guard is knocked out cold.
"What the fuck?"
The guard looks at Raros.
There is a single guard with no pants on.
He finds himself in a changing room.
Kind of.
But still breathing.
The guy is unconscious.
He froths at the mouth and shampoo bubbles float into the air.
He shudders and has a seizure.
He feels only the unholy taste of bubbly hair product.

Shampoo leaks out of the scratches.

Kisket pulls her parachute.
DO I PULL MY PARACHUTE NOW?

Kisket hasn't opened her eyes yet.
Kisket jumps backward out the plane.
Go!
One.
Two.
Three.
She's facing the inside of the hangar.
Kisket doesn't look.
Yeah.
They fly high above the warzone, and come to a stop above Vox Mortis' Ship.
They take off.
Kisket nods.
You'll be alright though?
Shouldn't be too bad.
Right.
Ok captain drop trooper.
It's got sentimental value and all that.
I don't wanna ruin your nice chainsaw though.
I'm sure we'll get lucky or something.
Kisket shrugs.
Sounds like a plan.
So we're dropping on top, we don't know how we're gonna get in, and we've got one parachute.
Thanks.
Kisket smiles,
There's literally no way in hell you don't know what dibs is.
You've gotten into so many arguments with Tracy about dibs.
Dibs.
Kisket looks at Raros.
Do we have like, parachutes or something?
That is pretty fucking sweet.
I've wanted to talk to Vox for a while now, and this might be the only chance I get.
Let's focus on that ship.
Look that's fair.
Seriously.
It's that I like her mom a lot more.
Don't get me wrong, It's not that I don't like Veruvi's dad or anything.
I'm not really feeling it.
Don't look at me like that, it's creepy.
That should be pretty obvious.
I mean.
So what's the plan?
Kisket follows Raros.
They head out.
anyway, lets get g9ing.
She seems t9 like him a l9t m9re than she lets 9n.
I think Sirie w9uld have wanted me t9 help my dad anyway.
9kay.
Fine then.
Kisket rolls her eyes.
You're seriously gonna do that?
Seriously?
Kisket looks at Raros, then at the ship.

They pour onto the ground and join the fray below.
Dozens of aliens begin to drop out of openings in the side of the ship's hull.
It's long and silver and they've all seen it before.
A ship breaks through the clouds above the black tower.
H9nestly I'm starting t9 like 9pti9n three a l9t m9-
We get 6ack in this ship and leave.
9r...
9r we side with my dad and help 9ut.
That's her there.
Veruvi points out a person below.
9ne, we help my m9m 9ver there.
We've g9t a c9uple 9pti9ns...
S9...
Veruvi frowns.
S9...
Kisket nods.
6etter late then never.
Well.
9kay.
And everyone else is not.
But one could assume that the side that's struggling to push away the horde of people from the big black tower are with Veruvi's father.
It's impossible to tell which side is which from this far away.
There's explosions, gunfire, people dying left and right.
They're about 40 yards away and two hundred feet above an all out battlefield.
They exit the ship.
hey are we there?
Tracy takes out his headphones.
Kisket shakes her head.
What the hell is a beeffucker, Raros?
Kisket holds her mouth to stop from laughing.
Veruvi heads to the cockpit to guide Krayna and help find a spot to land.
They enter the planet's atmosphere.
They enter a hyperspace gate to Ipo-Rakaikon.
It takes off.
If we c9uld get there quickly that w9uld 6e excellent, please.
I need t9 get t9 Ip9-Rakaik9n.
6een 6etter.
I'm okay.

Hi, Krayna h9w are y9u?
They get ready and head over to Krayna
I'd like that.
Veruvi nods.
His day has been made.
Cypress grins.
He walks past and goes down the hallway.
Cypress walks by.
I d9n't want t9 g9 al9ne. I guess.
It's kind 9f em6arassing.
I uh...
And I-
She said I needed t9 6e there.
Veruvi raises both hands above her.

Sirie just said she th9ught I 9ught t9 kn9w, and that she did everything she c9uld think 9f t9 st9p things fr9m c9ming t9 this...

She lies back.
Veruvi sits on Shanta's bed.
Hey, can I c9me in?
Veruvi knocks on Shanta's door.

Life is good.
Edited previous message: Kisket and Polya even made Shanta pancakes for her back-home-brunch.

Amaranthe didn't show up.
Yvelte called and sent two letters in envelopes with hearts on them. She informed Shanta that she will no longer be living on Zenithon.
He stayed for five minutes.
Voracious left the house for the first time in five months to visit Shanta.
Veruvi visited every other day.

Kisket visited regularly. On thursday, she yelled at the doctors for an hour for not changing her sheets.
For the first two days, before Shanta woke up, Tracy spent nights sleeping by her bed, afterward he only came by once in a while, with Kisket.
I'm going to be sick.
Kisket watches this.
He is thrown to the back of the ship.
Tracy is still standing.
IN SPACE.
i FROZE TO DEATH
what the FUCK
Tracy respawns in the ship's respawner.
Kisket shrugs.
She puts Shanta in a chair, straps her in, then sits back down.
Kisket drags Shanta onto the ship.
Tracy is nowhere to be found.
Kisket gets out and picks up Shanta.
Kisket gets up.
Shanta.

Kisket sits in one of the chairs.
Kisket groans.
Kisket slides across the floor.

She grabs Tracy by the arm and pulls him behind her up the stairs.
Kisket nods.
Radios are jammed.
Kisket frowns more.
Kisket calls Krayna.
Kisket frowns.

Tracy freaks out over the controls in the control room.

He then kicks it into the corner.
Tracy uses pyrokinesis on the guy's body.
Tracy enters the control room.
Tracy bangs on the glass of the control room.

Tracy shoves Loop out the way.
oh FUCK
what the fuck.
like maybe not cutting his arms and legs off is nicer, but
i mean
what's your problem with fortu?
Tracy follows a solid thirty seconds later.
Kisket shoots the guy Raros just kicked in the feet, then follows.
Tracy watches his new friends get butchered.
Kisket shoots one of the two in the head.
He rubs his face then follows Kisket.
Tracy looks around.
Kisket follows Raros.
why did they do that?
what the fuck?
Kisket is still dumbfounded.
Kisket's jaw drops.
holy shit did kisket really suck his dick?!
Yep.
Thank you, Raros.
Kisket flushes, washes her hands for a minute exactly, then leaves.
Kisket goes into the bathroom.

"Alright." He says. "Lets get the fuck off this planet."
Mars watches all this.
The panel next to the door changes from blue to orange.
Behind them the door rises up from the ground, and the three bars slide back into place.
She lets out a long sigh.
Aradia frowns.
Jesus H. Fucking Christ.
The hole leads them straight out of the entrance to the cave.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aradia leads them through the hole.
lets g0.
Everything beyond that hole is black.
A hole opens in the wall to their left.
Then, a second later, he recoils as if he was shocked by static.
He freezes.
Mars touches the door.
Huh.
Mars heads over to Uti.
Hey you okay?
Uti recoils as if he was shocked or stung.

As soon as his fingers touch the door, million still images flash through his mind. He sees fire, moons, white, black, hands, hair, and an antler.
It flits and flickers like fire, and it casts long shadows across the rocky floor.
There's a glow to the door that doesn't seem to be coming from anywhere.
At the end of the cave there is a door, much like the door at the entrance to this place, but the metal looks almost rotten, sordid bronze and motted gray metal.
The cave ends.
Suddenly, they can walk no further.
They walk for a very long time.
They walk for a while longer.
Aradia raises an eyebrow but doesn't say anything.
He puts it in Aradia's hair.
Mars picks one of the glowing flowers.
They walk for a while longer.
Mars declines.
She offers it to anyone who might want some.
Aradia has a sip of a water bottle she brought.
They walk for a while.
They begin to follow the river.
Aradia nods.
Right.
Are you alright?
Mars and Aradia follow Uti to Distan.
She looks asleep.
Distan is lying down in that pool.
There's a small river running down this cave, that originates from a pool that they're all standing around.
They enter a cave tunnel, it's dark, but lit with small crystals embedded into the wall and bioluminescent flowers.

Distan reaches the end of the hallway.

Lets continue on.
Alright, the only way out is forward.
A door opens in the back of the room.
Aradia opens the body bag on her table.
Definitely.
There appear to be body bags inside of body bags, ad infinitum.
There is a third body bag within.
There is another body bag inside of it.
Aradia stands up and finds one on the operating table next to her as well.
There is a body bag on Uti's operating table.
What the fuck is this?.

There is another body bag of the same size inside.
Mars unzips the body bag.

Eventually the rock dissolves and he picks up another.

With a pair of tweezers he picks up a rock fragment.
The man returns to his tool platter.
The person runs the scalpel down the incision line on his chest.
He pulls on gloves, and picks a scalpel from his tool platter.
The person ignores him, instead proceeding to mark down his chest and arms with his hands.
The room he's in is white and bare, save for his own bed and a rolling cart covered in tools.
Someone walks up behind him.
His hands and feet are bound to the bed.
He's lying down on a soft-ish foam bed.
Uti wakes up.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are twelve other doors.
The hallway remains empty.
He mutters to himself "What the hell are they teaching kids these days?"
A2 rolls his eyes. "Every noble Ahmkara has arms like these. You should know this, you have them yourself!"
"You want me to explain the concept of a hand to you?"

"... What? Uh... Can-can I help you?"
It looks almost human, but from its back sprouts a massive, cascade of arms, that seems to shift in numbers as it moves.
The bedroom's occupant turns to look at her.
It is a bedroom.
The door opens to a room.
She walks, in a complete corkscrew, entirely unaffected by any external forces.
some are where the floor ought to be, some are upside down, all in accordance with the spiraling path.
There are a few doors along the walls of the hallway
Behind her, aside from the complete lack of anyone else, she notices the massive black void that the rest of the hall seems to disappear into.
It doesn't seem like the spiral has an end.
Looking down it, she can see that it seems to twist itself in a spiral.
The hallway is long, and made of metal.
The lights turn on, all at once.
Distan is alone in the hallway.
She blacks out.
Something heavy lands on the back of her head.
She heads to the door, opens it and steps through.
In the distance she sees a door, cracked open, with a sliver of light streaming through.
She walks forward with one hand on the wall.
She has no way of knowing this though.
Aradia is alone in the hallway.
Uti blacks out.
The door closes behind him and something heavy lands on his head.
He steps inside.
He slides it open.
It opens slightly.
There is a door ahead of him.
Uti is the only person in this hallway.
Uti is alone.
There are no lights, the hallway is pitch black.

He looks at the north wall.
Uti looks around.
all we ever had t0 d0 was stand 0n it.
I don't know how to make this thing work.
He stomps on it a bit.
Mars is jumping repeatedly on the center of the elevator.
She gestures for them to follow and heads back to the elevator room as well.
Aradia looks at Distan and Uti.
Mars heads back to the elevator room.
Alright lets leave.

Nonetheless, I do feel a tremendous amount of pride. Pride in my underlings, pride in my empire. Within the week this facility will be cleared of its occupants as we prepare for renovations. I wish everyone luck in their endeavors. When I return, my facility will be complete, re-staffed, and my service will continue.]

They head to the south room.
[A262: Thorough testing has led to the conclusion that Element O is much to volatile and unpredictable to use as a power source for the sentinels. I had thought that with the raw energy of Element O, the sentinels would have no problems whatsoever. There was even the possibility that they could have far exceeded any expectations we had of them. While this is true in theory, J451 died in an accident yesterday involving Element O before we had a chance to try to harness it; therefore the director has banned the use of the element indefinitely, or at least until further notice.]
[Anonymous: Fuckin’ A2 had us requisition six huge ass crates of Element O for his science fair experiment and the Director just rolled with it. Now J4 is dead and we’ve got five unopened crates of the crap just sitting in MY corner of the research lab. MY CORNER. What the FUCK.]
[J451: The Director has halted Project Sentinel until we solve the issue of a power source. A262 has proposed using Element O to power the sentinels like it powers our warp drives. Frankly, A262 is an idiot. Element O is much too volatile and unpredictable for something like this. I’ve heard stories. I don’t want anything to do with that substance.]
[B648: A2 is a colossal fuckup. Don’t tell anyone I said that.]
The room is the same, but the Oxium terminals are gone, and there are three doors.
Then it recedes.
The light becomes blinding.
The walls shine brighter, the floors seem to change materials from steel to burnished gold.
The liquid sort of fizzles out of existence.
Boring.
The shining of the room intensifies.

Aradia wades back onto the platform.
And you haven't done anything so far!
And for no fucking reason.
I didn't bitch out at all? You're the one bitching out!
Mars takes a breath.
I don't understand why you're saying what you're saying.
How? How is that pussy shit?!
It's literally impossible for me to do anything with those oxium things.
And what the fuck do you mean pussy shit?
If I had Oxium I would have been able to get out of those hands easy.
Yeah...
I can't use my oxium.
No I mean.
I'm spent.
Aradia passes Uti the rock.
it's w0rth a try
It glides in a circle around the platform.
Something swishes through the liquid around them.
Holy fuck what the hell was that?

Aradia blasts the hands off of Mars and pulls him out.
Distan falls to the ground.
She steps into the liquid.
Her hands glow white and she vaporizes the hands that reach for her before they manage to touch her.
Aradia turns her attention to getting Mars out of the liquid.
Aradia tosses Uti a rock.
what?!
Uti notices as hands sprout beneath Uti's feet.
0h fuck.
Mars begins choking.
The hands are slimy, and they begin to touch her face as they pass her through the air toward the liquid.
Hands sprout from the ceiling above Distan, the wrench her into the air.
[Aradia rolls a 4 for luck.]
Hundreds of hands burst from the floor and pull him face first into the liquid.
It smiles.
His reflection looks back at him.
[Mars rolls an 18 for luck.]
He looks at it.
He crouches by the edge of the liquid.
Mars walks to the edge of the elevator platform.
i'd really rather n0t get that 0n my sh0es....
Aradia frowns.
It slowly begins to fill the room, but doesn't quite reach them on the elevator platform.
Uh.
From cracks in the floor tiles a clear liquid begins to rise.
The dirt from the floor disperses.
Grime and moss recedes from the walls leaving them sparkling like polished platinum.
The room takes on a strange glow.
The room begins to glow
Mars does another two.
There are 8 of the oxium terminals.
They're in a circular room with no doors.
The elevator stops.
Okay this is starting to hurt.
y0u keep up the g00d w0rk.

She's just mad she couldn't phase me.
Thanks, Mars grins.
I give that a solid 4/10.
Nice resounding button slam
Damn.
They head to the final room.
There are two oxium rocks inside the crate, Aradia puts them in her pack for safe keeping.
They head across the newly formed bridge.
Aradia activates this one.
The ledge leads to the fourth oxium terminal.
Mars carefully follows Distan.
AHH NO
Aradia pushes Mars forward.
Alright, ladies first.
There is a ledge outside that leads further into the cave.
A large section of the wall next to the top monitor is missing.

Only five of our designs will become sentinels, that leaves eight of us with nothing to show.]

The door opens to another cave floor, there are three softly glowing terminals, comprised of light.

Thank you.

Now would be a good time to say something nice about me.
Looks like I opened the door.
The door is no longer there, as it has been opened!
They run to the door.
They exit the car
Aradia crosses her arms.
Aradia rolls her eyes.
Aradia, praise me please.
Look at that, this time I did the important thing.
Mars feels a tad drained as well.
It flashes, then turns blue
Mars hits it before anyone else can do anything.
There's a panel on the wall of this cave as well
They go inside.
Oh wow, a cave.
They drive along the northern wall for a while and run into yet another cave.
Mars shrugs to Aradia "Nothin'"
It's beady eyes are wide with interest.
The Biowarrior: Covert Zebra looks up at him.
what was that?
He puts it in his pocket.
He finds a pretty shell.
Mars sifts through the sand in the water a bit.
Uti starts to think there's nothing here.
He squats.
Mars walks up to the water's edge.
And a nice shell.
He finds a cool looking rock
The watering hole is empty
What are you doing?
The watering hole is stained red.
There is only one Biowarrior: Covert Zebra drinking now, the rest have left.
Everyone gets out the car.
One of the bars holding a blue light slides effortlessly into the mountain.
They all get in the car.

Huh

Is that everything in here?
Good shit
You opened the wall.
The metal wall slides to the side, opening.
It shines brightly for a moment, then turns blue. Uti finds himself feeling a little drained.
He touches the panel.
The orange light is coming from a panel imbedded into the wall of the cave.
There is an orange light coming from within.
The tunnel goes deeper
The wall is just as solid.
Uti is now alone on the other side.
Oh okay see you later then.
Mars rubs his face in his hands.
... What?
You do pretty well for yourself without them.
Really... I wouldn't have thought....
Distan looks closely at the wall and notices that she can see all the way through.
Like Oxium ones? I don't know why I've never asked.
Hey Distan, do you have any powers?
Distan slides her hands along the wall, it's covered in ridges and small holes.
Aradia sighs.
I just wanted to see Uti punch a wall for no reason.
Didn't have to punch the wall that was a joke...
Wait you
Distan hurts her hand, but not bad enough that everyone can instantly tell. The wall is unaffected.
Wow I didn't think you'd actually do it.
There is now a small dent in the metal.
He hits it very hard.
Uti punches the wall
Uti try to punch the wall.
Anyone wanna try?
You think we could break it?
Really?
Uti knocks on the wall, it sounds hollow.
That doesn't look normal.
The cave is pretty shallow, there's a solid metal wall blocking the way.
I don't know, I'm just trying to derail whatever we're doing
mars what are y0u talking ab0ut?
You can't eat them the same way.
I mean they're both good, but like
Those are two very different kinds of meats.
No i mean.

How do you eat ribs like chicken wings?

To their right there is a large cliffside, that turns inland. In the distance they can see the beginning of a tropical forest.

They enter a circular atrium, with a massive glass ceiling.
Bastien and Dravic download it as well.
He downloads it.
Mars checks out the map.
"There's a map by the door to your left. You should like. Download that, if only to keep things fair."
"OH WAIT."
"YEah yeah fine."
"T, get those fucking monitors working already."
"Oh how defeated I am."

"What the fuck is a meme!?"
"..."
"Was that supposed to be funny? Hey T, is that supposed to be funny?"
"Was... That... A joke?"
Mars chuckles.
"Man well, whatever, we're gonna have a fucking blast."
"Oh... Ah damn, that's a little disappointing..."
... Yeah.
"Those boys are here too, I'm assuming, you're here right?"

"Alright, bye."
"I've got the coordinates of the station enclosed in the file I'm sending with this message.... So. Don't keep me waiting, kay?"
Probably.
Yeah...
Mars frowns.

There's some static and a long laugh.
"If they aren't here I'll uh.... do something... I'll slaughter a whole planet's worth of people."
"You know the ones. The ones you brought back from the dead?"
"Only one thing. I want those two kids to be a part of this game of ours."
"Pretty simple rules, huh?"
"But If I catch you... I win! And my prize will be a secret."

"HELLOO you monad cunts! It's me! Your friend Neon! I - haha - I've got a bit of a proposal for you huh? I think you're gonna like it..."
"It's - Is it on? Holy mother of fuck that took forever."
He presses play.
Bastien plugs his phone into the ship's speakers.
"Dude, you should hear this. Look I'll put it on the speakers."
"I listened to it." Dravic says.
Nah.
"So have you all heard this chick on the audio file yet?" Bastien asks.

I wouldn't know, I haven't not fucked up a mission ever.
Nice!
A long... Time. Is that a long time?
Damn. That's....
How's it going Anunda?
Yeah.
Riiiiight.
Mars sips some orange juice.
I couldn't tell.
You were?
You like her or something?
You paid extra attention to her.
Petra proceeds to go back to looking at her phone.
A girl who hasn't talked says "I'm Petra."
"Bastien" The man says.
Reliable?
What the fuck?
"That sounds like some kind of rock."
She tilts her head to the side.
Pino looks at him.
"I'm Pino, by the way." The woman says.
"Honestly it's not even in your control," A woman says, "If we say it enough, it will stick, and it won't come unstuck."
"Nobody will ever forget you," The man says.
"I dunno," Jannessen wiggles her eyebrows, "it's got a nice ring to it."
Oh god.
"You could call them Terror Fuckers." One man says. "They fucked that guys plans in the ass."
... It really wasn't a big enough deal to make a name out of.
"What kind of name do you make up from that?"
"Terror catchers, Terror stoppers? Terrorist police?"
"But I mean, It's always the ones you least expect, right? Hey assholes!" She shouts, suddenly "What the fuck, Introduce yourselves to the terrorist catchers."
"I'm doing great." Jannessen shovels meat into her mouth. "It was Gare, right? The terorrist? Weird. He's a super nice guy."
Mars sits down as well.
"How's it going?"
She's at a table with several others.
It's Jannessen, standing on a bench.
"Oy Uti, Mars! Come sit over here!"
As they're going to find a seat they notice someone shouting and waving, incredibly enthusiastically at them.
Yeah, sure.
Mars shrugs.
That's always a good explanation.
It's a shitty design, either way.
I guess, maybe.

Alright, lets go.
This was a bit of a waste...
Alright alright fine.
The question was any one of your neighbors...
I mean.
Gare, huh?
Harsh.
Castrated?
Okay, so if you could have any one of your neighbors get thrown in jail, who would it be?
Nah it's not like that.
So.
Something like that.
Uti will like suckle your toes and call you mistress.
Let us in.
Holy fuck.
Cumface.
Come on, Uti lets check on Distan one more time.
Thanks!
Alright I think we might check on Distan-ino next.
Haha.
Yeah.
Stretching?
Like.
It's...
I don't know.
Would he do yoga with a bomb?
Mars snorts.
Would he try to calm it down to keep it from exploding?
Would that be something he would do?
Talk to the bomb?
Alright.
That helped a lot.
I was just trying to get some outside opinions on the people here, really.
No worries.
Or like.... Who do you like best in the block?
So who do you think couldn't possibly have done it?
Okay.
Nah that's valid.
...
Who do you think did it?
So like.
Nah no worries man.
Yeah.
Nah.
Sup dude.
Mars knocks on Ren-ia's door.
Lets go.
Alright.
Why?
Where to next?
Sorry to bother you again
I think that's it
Alright.
Mars frowns a bit.
Well.... What do you know about bombs?
Hmm.

So...
Alright well this changes everything.
Holy fuck.
Why didn't you tell us this before we fucking started ranting at people at 3 in the fucking morning?
What the fuck so it can move on it's own?
...
At this rate we ought to just arrest the entire complex and be done with it.
That sounds absolutely retarded.
and was Ren-ia supposed to unknowingly pass it to Ara-Cro or something?
You think she unknowingly passed the bomb to Profernicus, who unknowingly passed it to Baldr who unknowingly passed it to Ren-ia.
What you think Carny did it?
And you know what happened there.
Cause the only one who visited him was Distan.
Nah fuck that guy.
Yeah, maybe.
Mars rubs his face.
No! I'm saying Profernicus did it and you're an idiot for not noticing the detonator.
How is that even remotely clear?
That sounds like some fat fucking bullshit.
You and Jannessen
That's what I'm fucking saying.
and unknowingly placed it on you in a way that you wouldn't find it for several days?
Unless you're saying that you planted the bomb yourself, yeah
How the fuck could have you not have noticed it for that long.
So all I'm wondering is.
Profernicus visited you like one and a half weeks ago.
He found the detonator right after you left.
You visited Ren-ia four days ago. right?
So like
How the fuck did you not notice a bomb detinator on you when you went to visit Ren-ia?
Just tell me one thing.
Okay just...
So like
Like just to make sure.
But lets check him out again
It was obviously Baldr.
So like.
Cool.

Yvelte runs out of the room.

"It's alright. He's got a respawner here, right?" Amaranthe says.
He runs back through the teleporter, laughing.
He flips Uti off.
Simon comes back through the teleporter.
Simon leaves as well.
The lizards release their captives and follow him.
Idrethal picks up the pieces of his gun and walks back out through the teleporter.
Oh shit!
He draws a knife from his belt and stabs it into the side of Luden's head.
Idrethal frowns.
The gun shatters.
"Suck my dick." Luden groans.
The gun jams.
"Luden, Kaiden says 'hello,' is there anything you want me to tell him?"
"It's time for us to leave, Simon."
"No shit," Idrethal grumbles a laugh. "He wasn't lying about this purge type armor. This is really something."
When the blood touches his armor it simply splatters across the surface.
Except it doesn't.
Idrethal presses his gun into Luden's forehead.
"Ha! Like Monad could protect jack shit."
He crouches.
The big lizard, Idrethal huffs. He walks over to Luden on the ground.
Hey.

He looks at Simon, then at Luden.
He looks at Mars.
He looks at Uti.
The sound waves ripple around his energy shield.
All the other lizards look at him.
It's a very large lizard alien, decked out in completely white armor.
Someone comes out of the teleporter at the back of the room.
Mars stands up.
Simon shoots at Uti again.
Simon hides behind a lizard and shouts into his radio.
Luden shouts.
He aims and shoots Luden in both kneecaps.
Simon rolls out of the way.
That's kind of cute...
The furry guy punches Mars in the face but it doesn't really do anything.
They are not happy.
Amaranthe and Yvelte are crushed against the wall by their lizard captors.
Edited previous message: The lizards slam into the wall.
The lizards are all very disoriented.
Mars attempts to tackle the little guy, but he slips out of his arms.
Amaranthe is pinned by a pair of lizards, as is Yvelte. The rest are being held at gunpoint.
They all drop dead.
They all swallow.
Mars in the meantime makes a straight dash for the little guy.
The nearby lizards jump on Uti, clawing and punching and kicking the general shit out of him.
The others are enraged.
The Lizard dies.
He licks his lips.

Mars closes the door.

Can we come in?
Oh wow that place is actually pretty nice on the inside.
Mars looks through the door.
We're done?
That's it?
So...
Luden heads in.
They enter the shady door.
"Not permanently." Yvelte says.
"I don't" Amaranthe says.
There's a big red X painted on it.
The uber pulls up in front of a fairly shady looking door.
They drive for a while.
Yvelte sighs and gets into the uber.
Amaranthe pushes Luden into the Uber.
Mars dies on the inside.
"What the fuck."
Uti and Mars get in the Uber.
The uber arrives.
"Lets just stick to the plan, we don't have time to wait-"
"That's a terrible idea..." Yvelte says.
What do you think bro?
We don't need this.
Fuck this crap
Nah to take this guy all the way there.
Lets just call an Uber.
You know what.

They see the subway station across the street.

The lizard dude dies painfully.
Amaranthe stabs her knife in the Gatling Gator's eye and shoots him in the mouth another 20 times.
The gun putters out and does not fire.
Uti's sword hand gets caught in the barrels of the gatling gun and somewhere, deep inside the gun, a spring snaps.
The gun is really spinning now.
The lizards hands are fucking massive though. so that doesn't really do anything.
He maneuvers his hands onto the handles of the gun.
Yvelte shoots the lizard in the face.
The lizard grunts and kicks Uti.
The gatling gun starts a' spinnin'
It stands up and hefts a gatling gun, aimed straight at Luden.
The fat lizard isn't really phased.
Uti's lizard fucking dies.
Amaranthe shoots the fat lizard 20 times, while Yvelte shoots Uti's Lizard.
"Holy fuck!" Amaranthe and Luden shout in tandem.
Mars is having problems
Uti pushes the lizard off him with that sweet 10 roll.
He could probably push it off.
This lizard is not quite as fat.
A lizard drops on Uti's head.
WHAT THE FUCKKK
Mars is crushed under the weight of the obscenely large lizard.
It was pretty loud how did you guys not hear- A lizard drops on Mars' head.
Or something.
Or maybe like KABLAMO.
It was like... KACHAW.
Yeah!
"What was what?"
What was that?
[Mars rolls a 17 for wisdom.]
Uti hears a loud noise.
Mars hears a loud noise.
"What? I gotta go."
Dude what the fuck?
"Guys Luden needs to pee." Luden says very loudly.
[Luden rolls an 18 for intelligence]
Amaranthe looks around, but doesn't spot anything out of the ordinary.
At all.
Because it clearly was not suspicious whatsoever.
Uti completely ignores whatever it was he just noticed.
Uti notices something move in a window to his right.

Yvelte readies a pistol.

Mars augments his rifle with acid.
They run into an alley way.
Everyone runs outside and gets into formation.
She picks up Luden and shoves Mars.
"GOGOGOGOGOGOGO!!!"
"NOW!" Amaranthe shouts.
Standing up in his armor.
Mars is asleep.

It is now midnight on Zenithon.
They wait three hours.
"Shut the fuck up." Amaranthe says.
Do you know when it'll be clear?
"...No." She says.
How about now?
...
Ooooookay.
"...No." She says.
Amaranthe stares out the window.
Nobody says anything.
So is it clear?
Alright...
"We'll get going when Amaranthe says the coast is clear."
"So whenever Amaranthe here says the coast is clear, we'll escort Luden out the building and into the subway. You'll be in front, Gibbs, and Mars will be in the back, Amaranthe and I will take the left and right, with Luden in the center."
Yevelte clears her throat.
"Sounds fantastic."

No I'm definitely thinking of the mamba.
"Can you mamba?"
"Mamba, like the dance?"
"Hey! You're the monad guys?" Luden takes his hand.
Luden himself is sitting cross-legged in one corner of the room, looking bored as all hell.
It's an empty apartment, with no lights on it.
They head to Luden's safe-house.
"Alright, lets."
Okay, sounds easy enough.
"We need you to help guard Luden as we transfer from this current safe-house to a base that's better hidden, where we can protect him easier."
"I believe that whatever plan they've been coming up with will be put into motion soon, which is why I called you here with so little forewarning."
"Luden is currently being protected by Amaranthe, a friend of ours. We're keeping him in a safe-house in the Pupil, but Amaranthe has noted that she's spotted the same couple people following them from place to place."

I'm Mars.
Yeah.
"It's a bit unnecessary... But... I'm Yvelte Ketush."
The concerned looking alien frowns.
Yeah.
"You like what I did with the room? It kinda feels like a scene from a murder mystery or something." Peridotto says with a hint of pride.
A concerned looking female alien is sitting behind the light.
All the lights are turned off except one at the desk.
They enter a very small office space.
Mars walks through the door.
"I mean I can't hold the door open and walk you back here. Use your damn feet," Peridotto shakes her head.
"I'm sorry that's a fucking stupid fucking name you've got."
"......"
...
Mars snorts a bit.
Nice.
"I'm Peridotto! Hi! I've got Yvelte waiting in the back room."
The alien beckons them through the door.
"You're the monad people! C'mere!"
An alien opens up a door in the padded back wall.
"SHIT." Something falls. "Oh FUCK!"
A bell rings.
Mars opens the door.
Mars frowns.
""Don't ask me, it's your mission.""
B, you sure this is the right place?
No answer.
Mars knocks on the door.
Except it's totally empty.
Or maybe a karate studio.
The building looks like a yoga studio.
A short walk later they arrive at their destination.
You're a fuckin idiot.
Fake names won't stop that shit.
Anyone looks at us they're like. "Hey, look, it's two monad fuckers. Lets stop dealing all our meth."
It's not like we can pull some undercover cop shit.
We're wearing Monad armor.
What suspicion?
Why are we using fake names?
What's my fake name?
Okay bro.

you got fuckin beaned
Yeah, I know haha
What does that mean?
For what?
I just finished
can't read more than 20 pages in one sitting
like i just can't do it
dune is hard to power through though
yeah man
cause dune is hard work
*got my hands full with books
i honestly g
who wrote blood song?
and mitsubishi from the cars
i got suzuki from the motorcycles
for the record
per round
20 damage to enemies 12 damage to allies
yeah it was ridiculous
and the one round where i didn't patient defence
i really only took damage from eric's bullshit in that last fight
though, i probably coulda dodged through all of them
the birds woulda done it without the nevermore
oh for sure
so you mean we coulda banished it and been done?
fuck swarms man
gg no re
spread spores, win war, hug daughter
*play him
[1557632020] Kevin P: And spread your daddys seed for you

&lt;&lt;&lt; you already know how to play
please do
you do it
i know i did
you'll get swarmed
just make a reddit post dude
figure out the mechanics for that
vargach could probably
OH YEAH
It's up
do big boy damage sometimes
but that's rogues
he did big damage sometimes
then he told me and dipped
he said he wanted to leave but had too much anxiety to do so
keta said he's been pretty uncomfortable since alix left and hasn't really been enjoying himself
lmao
yep
what concert is this?
yeah
(sad)
and its not like you guys won’t be fine in combat without “misses all his eldritch blast bolts” guy
yep
or today if i were to like, quit on the spot
the earliest that might change is like june
but i work monday-sunday now and from wed-sat it’s from 9pm-3am
or two new someones
keep going without me, maybe bring in someone new
i don’t want to be the reason the game ends though. 
im working tomorrow 
[1556174022] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: next week my work schedule is about to get completely fucked for the foreseeable future 

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
yeah
but i don’t think my dad gives half a shit about either 
tbh i’m not sure if i’m supposed to argue california wage laws or nepotism against having a 46 hour work week
im fighting for some days off but we need to hire some people first
so
where i work my usual schedule, but on all my current off  days i’m also going to be working nights from 9pm-3am
next week my work schedule is about to get completely fucked for the foreseeable future 
yeah, sure dad.
i can’t not go
and
i have a thing scheduled for tmrw night
what does it sound like?
rip
read skype faster
he’s the mushroom man, funnest gi around
and then eldritch blast them for good measure 
if anything tries to step up on you just blow 25 charges on the evil hand and nuke them with a necrotic disintegrate
playing etan is easy. protecc daughter by ending war asap, do whatever papa sporaghor says, and eldritch blast everything until it dies
otherwise, eric can kill him in his sleep for a session or something and you guys can rez me next week
so if anyone wants the massive everlasting honor of playing Etan for a night they can take him
also i can’t make this weekend
only because it's kinda close to home in that it could happen, and the likelyhood of it happening is not as low as say getting freddy kruger'd or hannibal lector'd
it's where the horrific parts of a story/film are centered around the idea of someone taking your identity and doing/saying/sharing terrible things in your name
it's where the horrific parts of a story/film are centered around the idea of someone taking your identity and doing/saying/sharing terrible things in your name
though, identity theft horror is kinda growing on me
body horror=best horror
so it's not irrational to be afraid or distressed by the sight of it
so much as the pictures are weird and disturbing in general
tbh i don't think it's a real thing
me neither
don't click that link
oh no
rip
oh
fix your school
unless someone bets 8:06
so guess you win
like 2 seconds before call
food just arrived 
thats the “asshole” part
just so i can be ready on time for you
im gonna be a lazy asshole and order food
we say 10 but there’s always something 
so it’ll start between 10 and 11
what time is it for you rn?
depending on whether or not there are any extraneous circumstances 
45 mins to an hour and 45 mins
guess etan’s learning the hard way not to fuck with gravity 
nope
hahah
Yeah, I guess
*rip
rio
ah
is it back?
fucking karen
a plane crashed into my apt and now i can't play
oh no
im ready at the agreed upon time
whelp
not if we’re waiting on you
boss fight should be fun though 
none of it good
yeah lot happened 
lol
ready when you are
okay, i'm back
i know where you live
i'll cut you with my 20 dollar machete
i will be ready at 8:30
This.
BROTHER FUCKS THE SHIT OUT OF SISTER'S FRIENDS AND MOM - GONE WILD
cause that shit sounds like the intro to a shitty 90s porno
you better not listen
?
"fucking stay locked in your room, Parsa"
she said
both work
or say "fuck you guys kys"
and say "i can't make it tonight"
ignore everything from above
if you can't show up parsa
which is fucking lame
but you can't just single click import shit from nexus mods
you can still mod on it
rip
or vortex, whatever that is
now you need mod organizer 2
and i just found out that the regular mod organizer doesn't work anymore
i just deleted everything related to skyrim so i could start modding fresh
yeah
they had a good thing going
like
can someone tell me why the fuck they made a mod organizer 2?
nvm
oh wait
yeah that's the bad one
cause that one is terrible
is it that strait edged machete with the hook on the back?
favored threat or something
i'll cut you has become your like
did you get a new knife or something?
LOL
are you sure parsa is the most accurate judge of character around?
and follow up question
did you hear that from parsa?
eric you’re a fiend
.
that'll make them leave you the fuck alone
spiderwalk on the ceiling
which means i don’t want to be up all that late. Probably not a huge problem though 
also, because of the LA marathon i’m probably gonna have to wake up early as shit tomorrow in order to get to work on time
with all the expected hiccups, yeah.
and ieds
and lsd
you take o chem to learn how to make meth
same thing
o chem?
what is this for?
rip
sounds like that one’s your fault 
rip
same
okay
10
Indubitably.
parsa and i together in the pink zone
try not to get into combat cause my aunt is making this take forever 
bleh
gtg for a sec
what the fuck?
wait, BARAKA AINT THE BEST MK CHARACTER
no i misread that
oh
it was goro
cough cough kenobi...
hi
LOL
make me
Gates open!
yeah
or earlier 
im just messing usual time?
Maybe next week
Play what?
im fine
or maybe everyone should ask me
how is everyone for tonight?
Thank you!
ag
i was wondering though how does kēta define himself 
no
b i g   gay
so itll be funny
so itll be funny
and cause i know he hates my character 
cause i believe in him
im entrusting etan to parsa
no
cause apparently here in studio city, nobody does any work except me
apparently the shift i work in silverlake is not the shift they work in studio city
too long
to parsa
[1550984360] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: you’re etan

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
[1550984357] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: im stuck in gulag rn

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
of why i wasn’t responding 
i thought i sent a pretty clear message 
you’re etan
im stuck in gulag rn
parsa
so i’ll be off at 7 but i won’t be home until 9
so there was some shift finagling and now im working my usual hours, but over there
but a guy at my studio city restaurant got sick
blame me
so
sweet
wow
you wake up at 7?
and frankly i don’t wanna play dnd with them shouting in the background 
they leave sunday morning
i forgot my aunt invited my cousins from boston over
bad news, i don’t think i’ll be able to do this saturday 
cause birds are dumb
way too many
fuckin
is just big highschool
college
you're dumb
mute
ya boi
which is a lot of the time
only when its my fault 
apologies but go ahead and start
im on the phone with my mom for like 10 mins
stock up on red bull
you gotta do what you gotta do
we’re going 6 hours earlier and we end 4 hours later
WRONG
i'm ready
ok
we're starting late
yup
rip
or family won't let you leave?
rain?
why?
ok
those were the eatin' people that were gonna get ate anyway
second
first, we're on the same side as that elf witch, she's just an extremist. which doesn't make her evil or against us.
11:00 for you then
im just messing, though. 9 is fine
thats an oof
better eat fast, motherfucker
we start at 8
no
(sad)
so at 8:14 start calling me bad names
to get home and get my shit all turned on
but im like 5 mins tops
i actually didn’t see that
no
fair enough 
why? you’re like a stick eric?
and also my last name
infidelity is my middle name
hail slaanesh
hey, those are the best kind
w-who’s cravings?
wo
shoot me with not-hunger please
oh boy
by hunger
apologies im gonna be a few minutes late, i got shot
That's correct.
Sorry for what?
sounds good
right
hey this week is a no-go, right?
an excellent meal
pork wrapped in pork broiled in pork juice and lathered in pork sauce
guys i found vargach
i’ll be ready in like 5 mins
any kind that doesn’t know it’s own size
no dice
so
but my dogs are rarted
if i were alone, sure
and it was saying some shit, that i didn’t wanna hear
that car had stepped into the wrong neighborhood 
hey
fair nough
but he’s lazy
parsa could have done it
won’t 
cause tahoe gets really fuckin busy
nice, hopefully it’s not too crowded
are you going skiing or something?
tahoe?
hahaha
ah man thats a lot goin on
^
you better not be
oof
im probably fine
im good. if you want more though, it’s your campaign 
im good. if you want more though, it’s your campaign 
l m a o
I think you did
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
wait it gave me a purple nail?
thats a good hand
yikes
yuh
Alix 
makes me really want 2 screens
that picture
a good 5 or 6 times
it looks like it hit it's head as a baby
dam
and cause you build your own combos and mixups from a list of moves
super simple inputs, very high skill ceiling cause of tech and a couple core mechanics 
which is why its the best
js absolver is like that
i like tekken a little better tbh
nice
tekken is like slightly slower sf4
i played a bit of SF 4
which one?
whats good about smash is that it feels smooth as butter compared to most fighting games
or stand
ok well
but in learning moves and countering them appropriately 
since the skill isnt in learning combos and executing them
the most mechanically complex fighter out there
better fighting game than smash
ABSOLVER
i’ll wait  for smash until the price drops to 30 on a used copy
^
feels bad
d a m n
esp if you’re trying to become a pool shark
physics could be necessary 
never necessary tbh
chem is like
school system is fucked
all i know is that i got straight c’s and b’s while turning in maybe four or five pieces of homework over the course of 3 years
yeah cause samo sucks
best class i ever had
i mean my 10th grade english teacher spent the entire year shit talking our class to our faces.
and never once did i have to put less than 40 marks on a paper
we did peer edits throughout 11th and 12th
yea
yuh oh
cause most people can’t spell
they should have kept em going
thats a bad thing 
tbh
don’t study
ya pearsa
play dnd
studying is omega cancer 
gold is something about a sun disk and obsidian men to the east and if it is what i think it is, i really want to  r a i d   s o m e   t o m b s
snakes seems like the most beneficial to us right now
cause
im thinking desert snakes or desert gold
has anyone taken a look at the missions?
rough time for a final
oof
but aside from that im rdy
alright in 20 mins or so i’ll have to jump out for like 5 mins cause my food’ll get here
that has ever been made
the most terrible thing
this is
what the fucking shit
timely shooter?
wtf
[1543717696] Kevin P: Repeating Timely Shooter
When you first choose this subclass, you reach into the fabric of time and pull from the armory of the god of justice, you can choose up to three different targets each bolt deals 1d6 piercing and 1d4 fire damages by themselves, not including bolts that explode or any magical effect like spells, this repeating crossbow has a clip size of 30, and shoots 3 bolts/arrows when the trigger is pulled, in addition, you only have 1 clip, to gain more you must spend 50 gold to reach into the armory to take more.

&lt;&lt;&lt; also
npcs arent there all the time tho
yeah
is that ai is an npc
and this shit
ai
the difference between
why.
why.
.
why
hmu
aight
for the next hour and a half
all the time in the world
i have
me
incredible 
apologies good sir
certainly not
and don't take out the bones
some people just don't have any common sense
look man
you took out the bones though, right?
turkey broth?
*everyone
we go through the front door and kill everyonr
oh ez
did anything happen after we talked to elin?
so im pretty sure i missed like the last 10-20 minutes of campaign 
nw, take care o yourself
im not gonna be late guys
thats just more good news
good news, i got home and my dogs have already eaten
just making sure your balls are fully attached man
they better be dragon dildos
what are you gonna do with it?
my fucking face when i get mail for yin yang at my apartment 
sounds like a good time
nice
that kind of attention 
its true
wot
oh right
damn, like what?
im surprised you missed this opportunity to flame
it wasn't me
and
only one person said they don't know if they can
"what the fuck are you doing at eric's house, you fuck."
tell him
get jett on here
jett at your house
why is
kms
that said both democrats and republicans can be idiots
i mean i guess
same shit my family does
that's just your family not bothering to actually ask what you think and instead just imposing their own ideas on you
that's not cognitive dissonance
im mentally disassociating in my early 20s
i don't remember that happening
shit gets crazy
that shit happens when you’re on acid
ask if she was on acid
I mean
assuming you take that shit to max level, which, in a realistic world would probably result in the mass genocide of every living being in the region, I don’t see how anything in pokemon existence could survive a single bite from that motherfucker
that beedril is level 20
and by that i mean decimate all four of them and all of their shitty irrelevant pokemon in a single half-hearted blow on the first turn of the first guy
you probably could ohko the elite four with him fully leveled
it fractures the veil of space-time, exposing the shitty game it exists in as a shoddily construed lie.
his power is so great, reality can barely hold itself together 
it’s coming heralds the heat-death of the multiverse
Murderbee, the Destroyer
that’s fucjin
why tf is that shitty bee so powerful?
i’ve got work from 8 until whenever we’re done with DnD
get real
yeah right
hey at least he has a face
:O
O
yea but it wasnt retarded and deranged 
because everything past that is crazy bs
i’d argue though, that it’s completely safe to stop paying attention to story after brotherhood
but yea makes sense 
didnt mean to say that
wow
(smile)
or ending with broderhood
like 3 numbered games?
which 3?
you can fight sobek in origins
thats the general mo of ac games these past 4 or so years
don’t think about it
o o f
name dropped who?
except on thanksgiving 
i never eat turkey 
same
maybe chicken if you’re a WUSS
you ritualistically eat pork and turkey 
its thanksgiving 
steak is good on thanksgiving. but pork is better
l m a o
i will now give them to others.
thank you for these thanks you have given.
e m e r g e n t     g a m e p l a y
that emergent gameplay shit
[1542805197] Kevin P: the first is an ambush with a goal other than just kill or be killed, and the second is an optional but much harder fight that the party gets to decide how to approach

&lt;&lt;&lt; yeah this is what i was thinkin
ooga booga
yeah
i think stealing the party's shit makes them much more angry than just killing it
something small steals the other horse in the ensuing confusion
maybe one horse can get caught in a bear trap and flip, and runs the cart into a tree
combined with oil dropped in jugs from trees above
burning arrows dipped in oil fired from tree cover
kill horses burn cart
the rest are level 2 but if he's a UA ranger than the level one guy'll be fine
the rest are level 2 but if he's a UA ranger than the level one guy'll be fine
what does everyone think of the cleric, the goliath barb, the lvl 1 CG ranger, and the dragon sorcerer
alright
was ez xp
look man he positioned himself like a massive idiot 
oh yeah nvm they’d just die
or you could just throw tucker’s kobolds at them and make them hate you
that they gotta break
it could be an amulet 
werewolf with magic resistance will fuck them up
that was a good one
ew
are always good
goblins
fuck phase spiders
yeah
^
hit them with exhaustion 
that too
or a werewolf 
or walking trees
do a wolfpack with pack hunting tactics
oh    g o d
but it needs more jpeg
idk
so i can get home
gimme an hour
alright alright
we’re not in g a m e
until we get those interviews 
im on strike
nuzlocke emerald  best pokrmon
jfc
but ribs are classics and boneless ribs just aint right
its true
the best cuts are boneless though
chicken is better boneless
thats it
uhh
tbone steaks
ribs
bones are good
that would love to ear your chicken’s bones
there are children in africa 
wot
^^^^
i n t e r v i e w s
bruh 
yes uncultured swine, ik
mostly just the ones you guys send
i don’t look at a lot of memes
where did you find that picture 
holy jeezus f’in christ
if i wasn't playing niceboy mc feelgood
or i would
imma have that cleric shining my boots with his tongue
we just gotta bully him a bit
he'll do anything we tell him to
don't u get it?
for us
weak willed is good
it wouldn't take too much time, but it would take away time from the actual session
since
we ought to do em during the week before next session
same
oh
that works
either that or we try to form a party
ezpz
and then we fill out the four
yeah
or better yet sans parsa since his character just joined
sans me
everyone pick one
tbh i could just say
and any opinions?
so who's looked at the sheet?
hence the discussions on who/what to hire
its just total party money
none
o
ofc
accept
lmao
I DEMAND IN-GAME INTERVIEWS
yeah i like chain pact much more
well yea
no
or chain warlock?
for triple guidance 
should i go tome warlock next level?
just messin
eks dee
and anyone else wants to do B, we do B
or if parsa wants to do A
basically 
yeah
shared party gold
esp considering that the gold we use to hire people is party gold.
anyway i’d be consulting you on any decisions
nope
space cowboy
see you
mostly cause im pretty sure breathing his crap will give us super cancer sooner or later
i think that would be a bad idea
oof
and start living in regular houses?
do we get to stop living in tents?
and through them we gain status in the army 
sinks for our excess gold/items
they’re also
and won cause nobody said no
and i nominated myself to captain 
apparently 
and 2 we’re getting a sub-party
1 who becomes captain 
yea
and there we have it
if nobody responds in 30 minutes its mine
i call dibs on being captain
okay
but i guess i could also flame you with it
oh im flaming her, not you
b i i i i t c h
don’t go to class
didn’t sleep?
tru
gonna say
i was
idk i’d say the wizard is smarter than you
like i think the smartest our characters would get is around parsa level
i don’t think any of our characters would be smart enough to figure that out
is bullshit still
which
and a magically locked door to your left
is when you walk into an empty room with the word overthinking on the far wall
my favorite puzzle
eTerniTy and sighT
yup
that sounds cool but is there an answer to that puzzle?
wot
this might mean you’re more stupid than me
actually 
im not actually stupid hah eat that parsa
is T
which
but it ends up as  “T W I C E     I N    E T E R N I T Y      A N D      A L W A Y S      W I T H I N      E Y E S I G H T”
i just keep missaying it
its 16
Did you find out?
16 shit
but 14 yea
not 14
16 whoops
i mean
the numbers are in base 14
i got the puzzle
i appreciate the meme eric ty
its good
eh
both would be most accurate 
both
or both
left or right?
which am i?
C:
a feeling this dick
your mom is a feeling
i did tell him to play my not shitty indie fighter
actually i’d go a step further and start planning a plot
having shit ready so you can dm is much more rewarding 
i’d say work on campaign setting 
apologies 
idk they’re all good choices, i think you’re fucked
pillars of eternity is fuckin dope
just for parsa
you should totally buy this COOL GAME called AbSoLvEr its SuPeR gOoD
also what campaign?
what games?
social media is fuckin. I’ve got a lot of grievances with it. It was shitty from the get go, with my space, where the whole design was made in order to make it easy to find like-minded people who share your interests, so you can form online cliques and shit
exactly 
stuff becomes impersonal, things with intended meaning become meaningless just because your ideals or whatever dont align
which is why i hate how media and news outlets these days seem to expect everyone who does anything to have an agenda or an angle that they’re trying to push
yup
or the art an artist makes and the impact it had on you
but i’m a 100% individualist. All that matters to me is the art an artist makes and the impact it had on me. 
personally i don’t think you need to respect people based on the impact they had on other people
ic
mars’ best of all time
it is a list of favorites tho
but YEH jojo’s refrences are great
cause it stacks the competition tbh. Bestsellers and really popular albums will be way more influential in general 
just each band and the music they make.
oh i dont really factor influence into those sort of list making things
havent listened to styx tho
of all those i’d probably only have led zeppelin and queen on my list
classic bands
cause Swans took the first four spots
assuming we’re talking about a top 10
but thats a tough list to make
possible 
i know a guy who did the same
oof
its not all that big
cause
i didn’t know about speedwagon the band until a while after watching it
yuh
REO Speedwagon
speedwagon was just a straight name rip from a band btw
also thank you kevin, for understanding that joseph is the greatest joestar. it’s so obvious i dont get how people don’t understand it.
[1542597340] Parsa Jour: or better yet, don't dress like that. the most sensible clothing a character had in jojo was joseph in stardust crusaders

&lt;&lt;&lt; a hundred times this
just not like bracelets on both arms
guys can wear rings
because i immediately assumed that you meant the problem was giant robots
because i immediately assumed that you meant the problem was giant robots
[1542582722] Alix Newton: train just got stuck due to mech problems and there’s three different hobos begging for money 

&lt;&lt;&lt; there must be something wrong with me
what kind of web design, like netcode?
this is true
p u n c h   h e r
oh fuuun
like "yeah i'll go to rocky" that's a very good example
it's very true
same
sorry fellas
then im gonna walk my dogs for two hours 
im nearly home
tos is my s h i t
do you play town of salem or something 
wot
yuh
But
fuckin 18
but if you do then i’ll say no you can’t switch 
if you don’t still wanna play it then don’t 
so you’re over it?
yuh
i mean enough time has passed where its free game imo
lmao
we roasted him for skipping school when he wasn’t hurt by the accident whatsoever 
no we didn’t roast him over it
thats fucking savage 
you roasted him for getting hit by a car?
lol
i want to be a wereboar fighter/wizard
can i reroll as well? /s
lmao
we could also spend a ludicrous amount of money on health potions 
FUCK YOU
NO
get real
hah
if you ever wanna add something but miss a conversation, just do it, lol. that’s what i do
this
i don’t think thats how that works but if you really want one of those things, who am I to stop you?
yep
cause the amount of fucks you have to give in order to wear that gross ass shit in public has to be somewhere way into the negatives 
is so fucking weird, but also a little impressive 
dude seeing people wear those outside
h e n t a i    h o o d i e s
except to transform them into sorcery points
sorclocks don't use spellslots
in which case
unless you're a sorclock
yep
yeah
i guess the 8 hr short rests would make warlocks op
thats uh
?
gemi was a dank meme
and milo was playing gemi
not even milo
nobody
yeah but who did?
?
dude you think i pay attention to anything that happens to gemi
nope
none of that was pointed out in session
i mean
and that was what made her see us in the first place
yeah but they told the chronomancer
the whole thing was to impress the chronomancer
guards?
wtf
no the fuckin son and daughter
impress people so they'd come help our country
that was literally our job in the country
very debatable that nature is a conscious force
i'd say it's
well
like
but hunter magic is from all the hunter gods
idk about druids being divine
that's what ranger magic is
but
lmao
idk i thik cat people are definitely heresy
hol up
yeah
is tigerfolk
rakshasa
that's not the name for it
but
tigerfolk is kinda cool
tbh
michael
that was only
no
g o d   d a m n
hahaha
^
?
shit was so bad it was good
tbh
im willing to do 8 hour dnd again
100%
which was worth
like milo's session, headbutting the worm
where i'll do some shit that's stupid enough for me to instantly die
eventually some situation will come up
i know
haha noo dont kill me
C:
shoulda done it
oof
yeah, in my case it’s cause i’m one of the few people who actually genuinely hates people in general.
yes
js
which is stupid 
well then being empathetic is not as related to general empathy as i thought
we’re practically sociopaths 
outta like 100 right?
cause i got a 13
i dont think that’s what empathy is
thanks parsa i thought it was rather high iq of me too, did you know I watch rick and morty?
T
the answer is
i think
ic
yeah i figured the e’s are something else
do you equate the numbers to letters of the alphabet?
one nutty puzzle my dude
that’s uh
ur safe
im only good at making switch puzzles
hey man
J U S T   G O T   C A L L E D   O U T
E R I C
yea
getty is far
ew lol
im not saying it was that long ago
cause being able to stuff your mouth with lots and lots of food was a luxury
historical rich people are all pretty fat my man
and nah dude
with milo
is some  boneless dinos
what i rly wanna see
i'll go look at bones with memelo
maybe not
maybe it'll happen
fucking jinx yuri hentai lmao
tbh
how you’re on my friends list with that name
still dont know
mine is foxy mclavish, cant be worse
that’s hilarious 
tight vi janna
its ridiculous
i know a dude who makes bank just installing ram and shit like adobe suite and microsoft office onto people's computers
i only meme
ever
no food 
more like
bio degree
rip
: ( rip belugas
how’s retail?
very understandable 
yea lol
neither are out yet
not like cyberpunk 2077 or my friend pedro will be
its not like a must play tbh
black flag was the best by far
now that they fixed the bugs, the game is playable and the animations are perfect
unity’s design was better imo
:0000
why assassins creed tho
wat why?
you probably meet all of them before you hit 39
yea
but when you do speak its awesome, right?
like uti for instance, i saw him maybe once or twice a year but we still talk and the fucker’s in new york
where you can not talk to them for 5 years then hit them up and it’s like nothings changed
5  real friends
yeah 5
and you gotta recognize those ones and keep them
you only make 5 or so actual friends in your life imo
in general
friends suck
true
which is why the fights were brutal
i mean, i didn’t know the beach kids, they were just little shits that didn’t wanna let the black kid climb into the lifeguard tower
i wish i did :(
i miss beach fights, that shit was brutal. shove kids faces into the sand then elbow drop em
i didn’t do any of that shit, all my fights were at school, at sleep overs or at the beach
oof
like sharp shit is a hard no
cause that other shit can fuck you up permanently 
i only do fistfights
wow
scouts fights sound dumb
lmao
yea i fought my friends mostly
fights gotta be fair
no i wouldn’t do that either 
she’s also cool
so i cant
cause she’s short 
never fought my sister
lmao damb
its the most visceral fun as a guy that isnt sex that you can experience 
i have but i was a kid and kids are very very stupid 
it’s impossible 
never. you know how hard it is to start a fight sober???
cause you have shit balance and shittier coordination
getting into drunk fights sucks though
those are the best kinds of memories 
but yeah with friends that doesn’t happen
normally i cut myself off before i get absolutely retarded
this is true
oof
*bruh
cmon brug
no thats while you drink
thats what comes
also eric, what comes after drinking? hangovers?
^ this is good too, this was me for a while
who drinks for what comes after?
but also do it cause it’s awesome and you’ll never feel better
thats good don’t do it it’s just one never ending mistake
: P
: P
That was my best guess, too drunk to keep going tbh
sounds like what you’re talking about
a tsunami?
m i l o?
i appreciated parsa’s paying attention, cause that shit came in handy 
they were good riddles
that’d fucking kill you, annnnd yeah, it might happen
my feel good nice boy will never die, t r u s t
alright next time we’ll let you die i guess
lmao
i thought it was good.
but uh, what’d everyone think of last session? good?
he is the alpha
its impossible to forget vargach
cause i forget his in game name
so its fair
i’ve only called parsa corswain like three times, though
i mean it sounds like a fake name
lmao
other characters i’ve played wouldn’t do that tbh
etan is a niceguy
i gave ya some extra money btw if you check r20’s logs
if i was someone other than the pathos-inducing good boye i was i would have been totally fine with it in the monent
i thought it was mostly character based
kk
we’re lvl 3
y u p
monks are the shit
monks = hunks
nice highlight
*person
you don't have to be a perso
you're an aligator
nah
w o t
eh
Hey, its been a couple sessions now and I'm afraid I dont think i fit the game your enjoying at the moment.
I gave it a couple sessions but will leave you guys here before we get to into it.
You seem like a nice group of people and I hope you enjoy your game.
-Sam (Jalas)
yeah
ok
understandable 
stuff like fleet foxes or sufjan stevens
indie pop branches out though
most pop isnt
k pop isn’t musically interesting all that often
individual opinions are the only ones worth listening to
popular opinion has like 0 value
in general
people are idiots though
l m a o
that all has lyrics
ever heard of animals as leaders?
hmm
what kind do you like?
its mostly instrumental metal
have you not listened to anything i’ve sent in any chat ever?
when did this happen?
wtf
metal????
like
you
but i thought the pentakill stuff was pretty bad anyway
tbh
and they fall under the label of champ promos
champ logins are all instrumental 
i mean songs with lyrics
that wasnt riot games
right
i think it might be their only good song tbh
their last good song was the jinx one
unless it’s a character promo
riot games needs to stop making music
ew no
counting on your fingers like i said
yup
on your fingers
counting
nothing screams stupid like i’ll kill you but I still like you but I REALLY DON’t haha please look at me senpai
i prefer that yandere shit
lmfao
deal with it
im not excited
 HELL YEAH MOTHERFUCKER 8:00
FUCKING WOO
okok
it has a good amount of emotion
stormlight isn't all that inpirational
okay hol up
yeah
i love it
is fucking insane
the fact that literally nothing happens until chapter 8
cause the slow pacing is what makes the book so good to me
i just fundamentally don't get that
like dragons
amongst other things
where magic exists
in a fantasy setting
yep
yea
dude
wait
im completely the opposite
larger scale, larger scope shit
you like the scale
cause the others were much faster in comparison
yeah i know
i just wish it took more chapters out to focus on the side characters
very well done there
oathbringer hit a good spot in the pacing
at least in the first two books
it's way too fast paced
i count that against stormlight in this instance
because everyone, and their mothers and grandparent's already know
and you can't emulate classic literature
style's changed a bunch
you can't get the same from classic literature
nah
yeah
yes i do like that more than world and character building
that's how you know the writing flows rly well
but kingkiller does like three chapters that are entirely in verse. and you won't even realize it until halfway through
it's so fuckin good
like ever
is top 10
stormlight's fuckin worldbuilding
that said
there's a flow to the prose that sanderson doesn't have at all
the writing is much better
and the narrator is heavily biased
the characters are told from one idiot's perspective
the perspective is different
get free money from your free money
and invest it into stocks
save your money
fuckin kafka on the shore
and that's it
but the best writer of the decade is haruki murakami
cause it's written better
i still think kingkiller chronicles is a better series
100% edgy
cause then it's just
unless you're talking dark heresy and the inquisition
cause the armor looks like buzz lightyear
except not edgy either
yeah
warhammer is dank dude
you'd probably like them
you ever read brandon sanderson's stormlight archives?
like the left hand of darkness, which im reading for the 8th time rn
but only when books are really good
cause i do that
what books do you usually read?
yuh
i wouldn't buy it cause i wouldn't use it.
i wouldn't buy it cause i wouldn't use it.
well then i guess it's not a waste at all then
oh i see
do you use it regularly?
did you buy a phb?
i just don't like using books for dnd
same
yeah well you're a nerd
and spend your money on a really good dice set or a figure or something
pdf them
or just
i was gonna say
yeah
but not rn
i will
pocket called
sorry
that was pretty heavy
im gonna sleep now, thanks
i blame you guys for making this conversation too interesting to leave
man i really didn't want to stay up until 2
but i can't because i don't have any money
i'd also love to get a camper van and paint it in some rainbow lsd pattern and drive off into the sunset to play guitar and smoke weed for the rest of my life
but most people weren't making the music
the music made then was fantastic
don't get me wrong
and plenty of other people i know
can confirm, this was my mom
who care about absolutely nothing cause their parents were too inebriated or too busy to teach them anything
hippy culture is beggining a resurgence too, but it's being done by millenials.
because the 60s, the 70s, the 80s and the 90s happened
it wouldn't work in america though
it's a strong system
and the now adult kids take care of the parents
but ownership transfers over
or they live in the same house
and then when they get their own homes, their parents move in with them later
but people don't know how to do that because after years of fuckin non stop partying, there are very few parents left to teach responsibilty
but western culture also has a stigma that once you're past 30 you should probably be a responsible fuckin adult
western culture focuses on celebrating the individual, and persuing happiness, especially in your earlier years, like 17-25
well whats the duty and the responsibility
which is a sick fuckin joke
cause a lotta rappers be out here creating things, persuing money to consume shit
which is funny
if you persue happiness through creating things i feel like that's the ideal
consumption vs creation
and most people are content with things like liquor, drugs, sex, tv, videogames, etc 
but that sort of happiness is much harder to obtain than other forms
as long as you're doing that in a field that makes you happy
you can be happy by persuing stability
not necessarily
maybe 80%
90% of adults aren't responsible
if you're a responsible adult you're awesome
thats literally it
awesome parents = responsible parents
good times
i grew up with no dad and a rich mom and always felt poor because my mom is a piece of shit
bruh
the shit that comes out of your mouth?
i don't think you're well adjusted eric.
because they made commitments then grew
which is make people mad at each other
legal and symbolic reasons that do do something in the end
yes
its true
literally nothing
yeah but what does marriage actually give to your kids?
but you don't have to be married to do that
well raise your fucking kids
yeah
even if they have kids
people in general shouldn't get married
society shouldn't glorify marriage.
not push for marriage in the first place
you could always
yeah it's true
only for your children
that's part of the reason
lmfao
instead of better subways
you should just build better roads
people drive cars these days
the problem with ny is that it's too small and too crowded
you never wait longer than 5 mins
new york's subways are close
la's subway system is gutter trash
but that wouldn't stop gang violence and such
that sounds good
well are you talking about LA or about america
exponentially lol
*a shit ton
so you’d need exponentially more trains
is that america is much much bigger than taiwan
the problem with 2 minute trains
5-10 minute trains is more realistic 
2 minute trains is a bit much
it works as long as you funnel your money into the right things
oh that's good
huge whale dick
taiwan sucks DICK
so if you appear to have unfair statistics about your student's ethnicities, you hate black people
but since new racism and old racism have the same word, there isnt distinction between the two
it's new racism
well
even though that's not racism
exactly
yes
cause it's just a convoluted way of lying to the rest of the world
and thats why i don't like affirmative action on principle
*being used
affirmative action is the blanket using to cover up that fact
as of right now
that's just the way things are
that's not a problem
which is that poor people don't have access to education
but it's just avoiding the actual problem
yes
l m a o
because it assumes that mexicans and african americans are stupid as shit
it's actually a very very racist rule
yeah
and i hate politics cause its stupid
cause everything on affirmative action is so politically charged
but i can't stand reading up on it
i didn't realize white students were benefitting from affirmative action and wanted to check
im not saying it's a race thing
uh
it just has to be someone that wasn't affected by affirmative action
it doesn't necessarily have to be asian
i get that its an attempt to help make up for the shitty environments that minorities grow up in
yes
it is unfair
i don't want to be helped by that law
i know
but at the same time, we shouldn't be making rules to try and make sure all the races are represented in all the schools
that's why affirmative action exists
lmao
in fuckin post 2010
majoring in musical theater
but because it is unfair
not because it makes your life harder
tbh
same
that's how it should be for art schools
public opinion is lame
that's how it works
cause a shitty essay shows you're good at rote memorization
you need a really good essay
and then i went for two years anyway
at that point i was like "bitch im not going to school idgaf"
"No chance, lmao. Get real."
gottem
I have a 1380 SAT score with a 730 in math and 650 in reading. I have a 5.1 gpa and am taking 4 AP classes now, 2 dual enrollment classes and have passed 5 APs.

The ones I am taking this year are AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP Environmental Science and AP Computer Science. I’m SGA secretary in my school and part of the clubs: BETA, Best Buddies, Res Cross, Alzheimer’s and played volleyball for 3 years. I am a Hispanic female applying as a computer science major. Please comment what you guys think!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lmfao
added a pls lmfa
even if they have a chance
everyone
and just tell them no
i almost want to go on and pretend that im a usc student
who wants to do that?
wait wtf
can i plz get in with a 3.8
can i get in?
that's all they ask?
and that's it?
i'd rather look at natureisfuckinglit
sounds lame
also why is there a usc subreddit?
why?
yes
yeah i can see how he'd be decent
im not a nice person.......
tell him it's a very fun and good anime movie
tell him to watch perfect blue
oh no
oh
that's zeldafied captain falcon
straight hair
before skin color
that's the first thing to go
we just don't
i mean
but his hair is straight
wajt he's black
dresses like that in real life?
yikes
uh
and
that's enough reason to round down
i mean it's .1
as long as it wasn't done seriously it'd be a fantastic meme
he should have done himself but super sentai'd
idk
and was gonna miss reg class
i have once, just cause i needed to turn in a paper
he just made a 3d model of himself?
yea
i don't have an oc, but i have a shitton of characters
for instance
and your OC
between a character
yeah but theres a difference
did he model his oc for class
is that his OC
 w a i t
have your headphones in and listen to some daughters on full blast
don't talk to them or look at them
and see that shit
so they get to walk in
and have it inside
get a sign that says "If your code doesn't compile and run, leave."
better yet
that's how i'd feel if i told my students not to model anime characters and the first thing they do is model anime characters

When my Professor looks over to see how I'm doing on my test
and i've never been happier
i haven't had to write one since i quit school
i hate writing essays man
exactly
yes
which is retarded
i've had to write 6 page essays on 20 tiny pages of book material
3 page essays aint shit
this is the real unlucky part
[1541144146] Alix Newton: half my friends are furries and only care about shitty furry art

&lt;&lt;&lt; this
wait
oh of course, apologies.
no only you're busy
that's unlucky.
that
i can't even sell absolver to my friends
which is fuckin tough
which means you need to be able to sell yourself first
you need word of mouth advertising
kickstarter
unless you go through patreon or
yeah
but that's very very hard
you can do characters if you do your own work
and having a job you like is so much more rewarding than a job that pays better
cause they're more fun
game companies are better
so she gets an internship at microsoft
as the one who introduces you to her friends
nvm you did mention her
ah
i've never heard of her
your cousin?
who the fuck is kelly
stop mentioning these people like we know them when you know we don't
please
lmao
yeah exactly
sounds like work that most people would be willing to pay a hefty sum for someone else to do
cool
yeah to get higher frame rates
whatever it's used for
thankfully we've got people like you to do it for me
that looks like a lot of work that i never want to do 
jesus
looks like cancer in practice
sounds fun in theory
oh is this for those heightmaps you were doing?
that's a nice harmless prank right there
and just mark it all wrong
and then grade it
and tell him to do all the wrong things
help him with his homework and shit
every night
Actually
fail him even if he gets everything right
only in the sense that that was the course you'd fail him in
so perfection was implied
the last thing you talked about before that statement was perfection
no it wasn't
you didn't say programming
did you just try to equate perfection to a fantasy portrayal of magic?
hold on
maybe your human mind is
even when i am wrong, im not.
im never wrong
i do
what if he does everything right?
lmao
those people are trolls
to provide some more context
it's a meme from 4chan
there usually aren't points to memes
it's a meme
theres no point
not if we didn't tell you you could not take it
because you're not doing it
and have to play absolver
so that you'd lose
i wanted to challenge you
ik
wow
:/
parsa challenged me
no
but making playable races is hard
i was gonna do something similar
damn
ah
but design-wise it's a fuckin masterpiece
the game is gross
well i can see why one of your professors would leave for destiny
ahh
did you hear about undertale 2 btw?
game dev major?
it devalues the art
i don't like social comentary in my art
he could be on tim and eric awesome show
that's fucking hilarious
holy shit
with a clothes iron?
ironed?
wait
that's a fucking roast and a half
at least
they’re cooler than high school teachers
professors are pretty cool
i could understand 1 cause its bungie and nobody knew what destiny was gonna be
gross
1 or 2?
destiny?
yeah thats the problem 
idk if art schools do tenure
keep more money
not to save so much as
or
to save money 
yeah i could see teachers being underpaid in that environment
ah
is it a state college or private?
right outta their jobs
no scoped em
yeah
oof
lucky motherfucker
you go to school cause your mom works there
that doesnt cover living expenses
so a thousand a month
7k
wait he gets
that doesnt pay rent
pfft
and didn’t get sick for a month or something 
and kept it
got a job
if he uh
no, but milo wouldn’t be a bad roommate 
*cover
i could save money on rent by moving out, but moving out means my aunt gets evicted cause she can’t covers the place herself 
pretty rough
and its a lot for a dude who hasn’t paid rent before
and its a lot for a dude who hasn’t paid rent before
yes
i miss not paying rent
yea definitely 
a half adult though
18 is like
i think i remember 24
no, sam’s 24 right?
and that’s 19?
wow
i dont hate it i was saying clash is league of legends crap
league of legends crap
i understand the batshit crazy family thing
he’s number 2
sister’s great uncle is phillip bailey from earth wind and fire
my uhh
thats pretty cool
i don’t even like a lot of e-famous people
i don’t like most. this is correct
reading comprehension. you fail.
that i know and like
yea i think i’ve only run into like three famous people who I know and like, including sam today
thats pretty cool though
yeah
him and his wife.
yup
yup
jackass
yes
guess who just rolled in on a razor scooter to have tacos at my bar?
OI
this is probably the better place for this
oh shit
aquarium water?
i suddenly feel like i got hit by a truck
holy shit wtf just happened
cant even hear her
spoiled the answer
w h o o p s
will mars be feeding his dogs for the first 20 mins
now the real question is
thats a fair assumption
yep
parsa thats what i was saying
parsa thats what i was saying
but lying aint letting them down easy
he said he didnt want to?
idk if you dont wanna go id still say you should just say that
sure
but still
i mean don’t do that haha that would be bad
yea
👋
*too
throw in some emojis top
just say “Fuck you I don’t want to go, peace out”


no its not today
worked better than if i had left it with IOS
and just use that
partition out 90% of the disk space for windows
thats what i did with my macbook
voice only
yea you need the space
oh
?
why are you learning this system that hasnt been updated for years?
sounds stupid 
its only 15 20 mins if you make an appointment, but this visit was spontaneous 
department of motor vehicles 
just to learn i have to come back tmrw
i’ve been at the dmv for 4 hours
you nut, eric
why would you time it like that tho
till dnd
but i’ve seen you stay up till like 4 every night. idk how you do it
for you 10pm
Oh sweet
that gives you proficiencies
oh i mean the uh, character background that you add on the sheet
i don't think any book backgrounds will fit the campaign, so pick one with proficiencies and tools that'll fit your character
did everyone pick backgrounds?
have a name now
Poeby Seawater
i dont even have a name
pick up my phone outta my pocket, boom suddenly im calling the group
i just got home like 20 seconds ago
or i type in chat: wanna call?
unless its on saturdays
trust
wasnt me
nope
oof
oh
lmao no
sweet
good question, eric?
sweet
im just sayin im pretty sure we already told everyone about the dragging thing like 6 times we don't need to say it that many times
so then you click on the option that says output, and change it from spellcard to attack. if it's an attack. or don't if it's not
so.
i'm specifically talking about spells that aren't in the i tab
parsa.
it's not hard, i just copy paste all the relevant details of the spells from wikipedia or other lists 
coolio
i can help you make em
makes things much easier
and keta u want help making your character tonight?
well the ones you plan on using most
yo alix do you have macros set up for the spells you plan on using?
like by hand?
painting?
sounds pretty cool!
cool, what's the campaign about?
oh is it over?
i forgot you had a different group tonight, keta.
oh wait nvm
yo
how
sweet
11:30 over in chi town
oh right
i didn’t get around to picking spells
oh sweet!
i was expecting answers more at like noon tbh
no rush, take as long as ya need
u too lol
night
okay. i should probably sleep. gotta be at work at 10 tomorrow
*same
sam4
since that's what he's always wanted to do
knowing eric, he'll probably want to go into prestige levels and super high level campaign things anyway
yuh
but i could also save that fourth sorc level for whenever too
depends on how long the campaign goes
that's very true
even though i want those fukin numbers man
and that's just flat better than an asi
for me it's pretty rough cause as a 17 warlock/ 3 sorc i get my only chance at a 9th lvl spell
that'd be good too
ah truee
tbh it might be worth going druid 16 barb 4or for the ASI
tbh it might be worth going druid 16 barb 4or for the ASI
1 point 1 feat rather than 2 points or a feat
since eric, dm made asi's more worth
that's pretty nasty my dude
resistance to everything but psychic?
are you going bearbarian?
very good
yeh
right that kinda sucks
oh oof
have a nice sleep
very very understandable
i guess someone will have to hold person people into my spike growths and hunger of hadars
feelsbad
wait cant stack big aoe cc spells cause concentration is the enemy
holy shit im just gonna stack aoe cc spells and quicken those while pelting people with eldritch blasts
*r4d6d1
you can type /rd6d1 to make it automated
we're doing 4d6 drop 1
nvm
oh
it's also
rolling i think
9 health on my lvl 1 sorcerer i'm happy
alright
so that could be it
my computer is a fat piece of crap tho
yeah, nothing really works
and my input volume is maxed
my voice comes out way too quiet
i could use discord to chat, just not to call. cause that shit's wonky and is a fucking headache
lmao
if you're taking the -5 to hit penalty yeah
*win
then looks like you wi
but hey if he can't touch you and you can touch him
yeag
u kidding me
ok nvm that's fuckin broken
imo at least
but broken at lvl 1 is no biggie
flight at lvl 1
ikr
i should add
an official book
as long as they're in a book dm's good
so you can go with em
they're all in a book
i scrolled through miles of stuff to bring you this fresh link
this crap
repost
lemme
KEVIN STEPS INTO THE RING
and we have OUR MAN
over who's better
cause you get to argue
duplicates are fun

i think im gonna be the crowd control bot if possible
wants to! i didn't even have to ask
we need a tank and a healer and this dude wants to be both
i mean i don't wanna boot him out just yet
yea but he's taking a while and i don't like it
hell yeah
a spore druid!
that shit's my favorite spell
*hadar
parsa says i want to play warlock for the quickened spell double eldritch blast, but i really just want it for hunger of hadarr
i mean im not against having two warlocks
incredibly strong
cause i can just wait until i hit lvl 2 in warlock and get devil's sight, which combined with darkness is
i just realized that im a fool too lmao
naw u can go warlock
ok
two warlocks?
no plz
despite being edgy as heck gives me dark vision
this
i want dark vision from being a tiefling, but i also want free feats from being a human variant
there goes my problemo
Shadow Magic(Xanathar's Guide to Everything)Eyes of the DarkStarting at 1st level you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet.When you reach 3rd level in this class you learn the Darkness spell which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 Sorcery Points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.
oh shit
i'm being the three dagger sorcerer
wo wtf is that
🤔
Two daggers.
(b) any simple weapon

like an owlbear ought to
and look confused
but they can stand around
yea
that was a shitpost
hehehahahaha
that's what i want now
can you get an owlbear familiar
unkillable magik owl?
i'll probably go either variant human or tiefling
and they make it terrible
or they do
because the people who make them don't think about balance
the homebrew stuff is broken
no
i'd say it's good
if it's in the books and not the homebrew wikis
all the ones that are in the books
uh

kenku are the bigger meme ones
arakokra are the meme ones

oh

lul
wasn't my fault
i'll still see if i can get that weekend off
&gt;.&gt;
and since diego's mentioning in april, it wasn't mentioned again
either way, after all the spam in this chat it's practically impossible to find
but the main issue for me is that i won't have time
but you hadn't decided on the dates when i said that i couldn't make the 17th in the first place
its already old
by second time
like
as much as i like seeing other dudes dicks, it gets old real quick
the other is running around with your dick in your hand
one is dicking around
theres a distinct difference
but thats not spam
yeah
bruh
you posted this like 150 times

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
fuck the other shit
thats why this trip is cancer
you filled the chat with so much spam that i literally cant find any quotes on the original plan
actually 
Hmm?
ok but originally we’d said it was on the 20th
but i still dont know how long we plan on staying
me personally i woulda needed to know the details like at least a  month in advance
ye
anyway, i dont think i can come :/
anyway, i dont think i can come :: 
its the fact that nobody’s communicating, so we’re still askin these questions like 2 weeks before
but the problem isnt the non reservations
yea
ik
that shits cancer
“did we resreve a campsite?”  or “where are we going?” and then someone either says no, or nobody responds
every time someone says something here we get the same responses
this shit turned out to be cancer
fucking
nice
its june 20th right?
nigga i’ll throw them hands with yo grandma i dont play nigga this 4th street nigga step
im fuckin tilted

michael
you'll just have to deal with being racist, michael
and all you have to do is say "yes massa" whenever your boss tells you to do something?
that's a little over 5 times the average yearly income
that's easy fuckin living
well i didn't actually do the math
if you're working normal hours
200 an hour you'll be a fucking millionaire in less than a year
but you'd have to shave the pedo stache to make yourself look prepubescent
tbh i'll like any rap that makes me audibly YUH
it doesn't make me want to sell drugs
unless you're selling like heroine and crack
you'd honestly have a hard time making 200/hr sucking dick
there's literally nothing wrong with that shit
i'd do it
200/hr you're making fucking bank
that's a really fucking good deal, you know that right?
rock isnt weird it's the most listened to genre anywhere
that's rock
and it's because he's doing some weird ass shit
i don't really like childish's singing
i've seen meme edits
but he's got his moments
you're still a nigger
michael you fucking faggot nigger
holy fucking shit you goddamn retard
I am not alone!
same
its so dank
Then do it
my phone’s getting retarded
Win
It was not
Haha
What story?
How so?
Is it though?
I did not know that
Explain?
Do tell
lets go
ok
I am always right
You know me
How do you figure?
You are wrong.
Verily.
I concur.
That's correct.
It is known.
You know me too well
I thought you might
I am glad someone does
Oh okay
I will not.
You are welcome
Hey thanks!
Pretty much.
we live in a society 
fellas
holy fuck
fuckin, suggested word spam

I disagree.
Too many cooks

Thanks and good luck!
Thanks I will
(puke)
skype gay
gay
(smile)
I probably did
I really did
Maybe I did
I do not think I do
I think so too
is that new skype’s auto response thing?
?
yeah
then sure
is philmont the la forest?
i don't think it'll matter
oh blessed
btw
have we decided on a date
at least it wont be that much of a burden on my famiree
yknow
so that if I do end up dying
I like closeness
will there be any pussy
pussy
I like
so 33 bucks if we're staying 3 days
cause it's a long drive?
if we all pool a bit it shouldn't be more than 20 bucks each
but like even if we do, we don't know how many people we're gonna be surrounded by
cause it's so fucking packed
the problem is you can't get reservations for big sur
literally just eric who's saying, "big sir tho."
no it's
you can only make fires in campgrounds
well
i just know in big sur you can only camp in campgrounds
oh in the redwood forest idk
you can only camp in campgrounds
no
rip
north, near the coast so it wont be too hot, and its a forest
that place is lit as fuck
big sur
what about fuckin
i mean if you bibbas wanna turn down some dirt road off the freeway and camp in the middle of nowhere im down
real gay
idk i find that shit to be
san francisco
except like
late june every place is gonna be hot
then we can vote on it
if you bibbas wanna suggest a real place up north
bumberfuck isnt a place.
i mean
i think milo's just worried about some ranger coming thru to find a bunch of nibbas doped the fuck out in the woods
cause like they don't usually like inspect your car
but i can vote again on my phone if you want
ya boi voted
you’d probably have better luck in the not camping group
i feel like you’re busting my balls or something
i dont see how that’d work man
ziploc... sack
ziploc... sac
its a box full of a bag of wine
you mean a bag, right
hell yeah, we fill the shit outta those boxes
with bottles within?
how big a box are we talking
but
understandable
when i hit those security lines
with having a quart bag full of innocuous liquor of dubious origin inside my backpack
i dont see whats the problem
yo but i could fit a quart tho if i just fill up the bag
is there a size regulation on the bag?
and poured that shit in the bag tho
but id fit more if i skipped the containers
into a bag???
to pour our liquor 
you want us michael
wait
is that stylish?
wasnt it gonna be mush’s from the get go?
but you can never be sure
i hope not
what about a tactical nuke launcher?
hidden compartments, right?
kms
tactical wagon
with a wagon
cant hike
you
very true
and canp in the mountains
real big dick bibbas backpack
well you dont camp like that in yosemite 
yeah that shit too
and rather gay
but the ride is too long
if we truly had big dicks we’d go to yosemite 
biggus, dickus
🅱️osepf 🅱️allin, 🅱️adolf 🅱️itler, 🅱️handi, 🅱️artin 🅱️uther 🅱️ing, 
same goes for every major historical figure
but you’d have to also change jesus’s name to 🅱️eezus 🅱️rist
so i’d ultimately pick the correct option
having the 🅱️’s would be a big dick meme
but
that shit would get so annoying
10 thou.
🅱️i 🅱️🅱️er
tis a good ass feeling
same lul
2 votes for every option?
are therre really
2 for joshwa and one for touching my wee wee
3 times
but i did vote
i can vote multiple times:/
fuck that cuck head ass joshathan

i dont trust you bibbas either
i would have said fair
i had typed random shit in my pocket
ive ever had
its literally the best tasting indian food
they arent upscale
and that restaurant
the difference between our indian

yeah but it sucks
but im game

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^

is indian
well the best meal in j tree
is yes
the answer to that animal question
also
im with it
pointy sticks and heavy rocks?
bruh that's gay as fuck
should i grab my dad's crossbow?
and don't bring food
so it'd be cool
yo but it's not gay
are you saying that you wouldn't suck my dick if we were stranded alone in a ditch for several days?
why don't we just like
they've got the best indian food i've ever had there
it's pretty chilly at night
tarps = big gay unless it's snowing
i’ll spam him
cancer
i mean w/e im close as fuck now

oeuf
*am late

im gonna be late
you fiend
5 day weekend
oh fuck
so i can have days off
im still in the spiraling out of control phase 
nah
i am
and you’re an easier target than leon. i can’t make any promises 
well we don’t like each other anymore
i want to kill him
were gonna kill ahn right?
ex dee
while you were out having sex with lots and lots of women i was studying the blade
try me, motherfucker
im bored
lmfao
just goes to show the struggle is real &amp; we out here hussling, can i get 10000 likes every like goes toward the hospital bill.
real sor, vros
hey guys, i was walking down one of the shadier streets near my house and i got shot so now i can’t play DnD
and est
central time
7:30 and 8:30
oh lmao
so you dont have to stay up till 3-4
unless you want to go earlier is all
theyre dead
nope
im getting home like rn
or earlier
i am
i want to go south, but i’ll go north if team needs to
i want to go south, but i’ll go north if team needs to
cool
And what is it?
run and hide
eat a dick, lucky fucker
parsa’s lucky, gets to keep his record of never missing a session
right right
fuck tmorrow then
sweet
one of the idiots at my job broke his fucking hand and i have to take the late shift for him
i can’t make tomorrow
was an int caster
i had shit perception
cant find the page for it
which was pretty unbalanced tbh
like a warmage but a psion instead
he was a psion warcaster
and even if i did, could yew have possibly stood up to cheqir in that department?
not to you guys
antagonizing to npc’s yeah
he wasn’t psychotic yet, but he definitely wasnt allll the way there, by the end though. yeah
if you were a lvl 5 fighter you'd be even better, but that's a pretty big investment
her thot-ness is currently revoked. so there's no need to bring her back and let her breathe again
Lyreth's a thot though
i'd be very down for reviving Gemi Chance
yeah well i didn't think about that part
the statement wasn't about how she is now, it was that leon didn't have to make a deal with white eyes to get her soul back, to resurrect, and instead could have just had neirya do it
well she wouldn't have been
*worthy
1000 magic items stuffed into one vaguely human shaped ball of womanflesh ought to be wprthy enough 
but we wouldnt have learned about vilya the rose as easily
instead of dealing with devils
u coulda just brought back what’s her face with the sword
also looks like you played urself leon
except we don’t know who that is hahaaa
cause that pc was op
then bring back letho of gullet
bring back gemi, pravaal and lyreth
ofc she was she made the stupid thing
thats the dumbest shit i’ve ever heard
what the fuck
dont bring back lilith
sweetyew pravaal 2, the reckoning
i’d be okay with that
lmao
omega fucking lul
its not t even leon’s choice?
 lul assuming leon is gonna give our psychotic asses that buff

so she hasn’t yet attributed it to izoldi because cio is a scientist first and foremost and something that utterly ridiculous requires further testing
the shadow stabbing in the back thing was worrying but cio still hasn’t told anyone about that
0 recollection of that happening
yea thats a 10/10
kai, white eyes, and all those dickhead elves aint shit compared to that fucking nightmare
Cio’ll probably put her lot in with that guy
also js with a picture like that for izoldi
okay
if he was also a character in ancilus
no i didn’t forget him just wasnt 100%
multiverse confirmed
lul
was it your character from milo’s campaign?
i remember that name
who was vix’elin
ha
white eyes is a good guy
yea
no he already gave me the stuff for it
which soul?
huh?
nobody called so i figured we hadn't started
gimme like 2 mins to finish making my spaghetti tho
yea
much more laid back
just in case
already do
honestly more of an asshole than i’d originally intended
haha yea
ah ic
im good from 6 on
like
ay i can start earlier than 8 if we’re down
well the bet was either he hooks up with ai or he's gay
that's what you meant?
but he's an aasimar
feels troll man. I can see Vilde and Letho either dying or fucking off to the jade gardens, but Lyreth woulda hung around until the end when all the elves got royally fucked over
lmfao
GRAND ASTROLOGIST OF THE STARLIGHT COLLECTIVE
 HOLY SHIT
LOL
that's why i got the backup character prepped
i wouldn't be surprised if we woke up one morning after a long fight, and leon had coup de graced all of us.
she can only make so many racist comments about eldorn before she gets bored of that, and aside from that she can't find anything really wrong with him
you're easiest. currently
but that one's not true
actually she's first and foremost a liar
which isn't bad
chat isn't filled with rees is it?
nobody's blaming you
inside she copies buddy and barks when he does
cleo doesnt act up at all outside
if thats what it fucking takes
just train that thing, socialize it so it isnt a psychotic little asshole
and the dumb bitch owner dropped her phone trying to pull them back
i was walking home and these two little shits started running up on cleo and biting at her
i dont get how people have dogs that are so out of control
i already did it
youre late
ok
im just waiting for eric to call tbh
rip
and i was gonna be 30 mins early
oof
saturday then
cant have jett
just
i do want to bring it back
that level
what level do you want?
im at work till 7
usual time
a lotta places have fake kobe or wagyu
was it real kobe there?
lul
regular sword and board shit
or just
come up with a character. Everyone brings a powder gun. Flintlocks, muskets w/ bayonets, rifles etc.
yuh
itd give me something to think about while at work since today is a fucking slogfest for some reason
not of eric’s thing but a oneshot
i could run a session
maybe
or
n o p e
sf is way better than la
just that there are traps round every corner
i didnt ever say i hated sf
and my mom
say hi to all the gays
oh oof
^yuh
anyway, i'm not at my dad's anymore. and don't have anything else in the concievable future. i shouldn't have any problems making it to sessions anymore.
?oh wait wtf it probably finally managed to send today
my internet was fucking up
i couldnt send other messages anyway
and i'm done
i was done by 8:30, but the router at my dad’s is fucking up and I can’t find it to fix the damn thing

saturday

.
it was because my mom is coming to LA tmrw

nierya?
alright what happened
cio’s been sick in the cart or smth
don’t fill me in until next session
sounds like you guys had a good session
that hangover shit was a joke though. drink responsibly fellas
No you stop
i’ll touch the shit outta those guys
i fucking will
fuck offa me
i’ve been hungover for 2 straight days
i been workibg at my padre’s bar 
get that money for that booze more like
and am
i did
all at age 12
right and the head of his church
what else was it
then my ptsd of trying to run a homebrew campaign with jett kicked in
i was gonna originally say -5, but then i thought, “that’s not balanced”
all it does is give you a flat -1 cha when held
can we give parsa the staff of fire and vitriol
thank god
and now i gotta work weird ass hours
its usually fine, but we’ve got some bigass party who bought out the place
or 11:30
and i can hop on at like 12
i mean u guys can do 8 today
im fucking not
shit, i'd call someone out on it
cause they're assholes
especially since i've been there four times since then, very not traumatized
that'd work if that shootout had been like tomorrow, rather than a week ago.
i'm not :/
cucked again by heinous evil magic
well no, he just got heal ed magically before i could do it the right way
i didnt get to amputate his legs!!
oh shit you did
cmon bruh
cause we didnt chloroform the orphans
why?
imma be honest, last session sucked balls
that i am a fucking god at predicting my schedule
i’d like to let it be known
will probably be there by 7:45 like i said i would three days ago
im nearly home
alright, next time then
fuckin i cant be walking around out there with my hoodie. a black man with a hoodie in 90 degree weather, they’ll shoot me twenty times before i can say “wait!”
but i do know that theres at least 50 cop cars out front
and idk how long that shit’ll last
and now theres a fuckton of traffic
there’s a shooter at the trader joes down the street from my job
idk if i’ll be on time
or should i pretend to be black when i'm the literal furthest thing?
several variations on what "pulling a jett" looks like
what's he studying there?
so i don't read most of the things he says
his taste in music is bad enough that i can't trust his taste in anything
so just changing peoples skype names and not saying anything doesn't mean anything
technically it's not a roast unless you tell people
that's fair
when i say if im not retarded, i mean if i put in the order for my dinner at like 6:30 so it's done right when its time for me to leave.
a. fuck you suck my dick.    b. i can't leave until my shift is over and the next guy is there to take over, because if i leave before that, then the restaurant goes to shit and everybody gets fucked because all the customers have a bad time and don't tip.
which means if im not retarded i can be home by 7:45
it says the next dude comes at 7
we good
boy
suck my balls
that's never a thing
. 3
if possible
sun
ye
lvl 5 and shopping
kill that shriveled dick right off
yeah
im gonna kill his dick off
fuck that old man
im not
im jk
or ur a pussy
dont pick average
you can take a feat that buffs your stats
dw bout it combat gets hard
broken ik
ye
instead of two stats or a feat
you get one stat and one feat
when you reach lvl 4 and add stats
also
ok
also
oh ok
okok
we didnt get paid
idk
and
no
no
swear to god
you better not change your name back to Loli Futa Trap btw
understandable
you’re a poor boy
you are poor
im black?
whats the irony?
ADD DUAL TWIN and call him a nigger
YEA
not nearly as bad as Loli Futa Trap
jesus christ that name is still grating
or 8 if you’re doing it with someone else
thats basically holding 9 people hostage
inting
its punished harder than fucking
LMAO
most are cooler
diamonds are pretty boring stones tho
ruby is cooler than diamond
now i’ll never be gold
fml
yeah
lmao
at least you arent a silver shitlord
ye
you only play norms
so who cares
i mean you dont play ranked
alll those times i’ve called you hardstuck d5 i was fucking right?
waitwaitwait
yeah
milo lul
is that what that stands for?
i dont know what that stands for
hmm
flex que or 3v3s maybe
i dont believe you
i
idk
like flash into an ezreal ult
godlike reactions where you do the exact wrong thing
both
i just have the mechanics of a monkey on lsd
lmao
if it isn’t intentional 
its not intong
you play league my guy?
 y e a h, thats why im an advocate for earlier
i just got off work 20 seconds sgo
and idfk
im on the other side of the dam city
wtf
i thought 8 
was it 9?
if its not like w/e
but only if possible
a 9 pm start is way more manageable than an 11 pm one
if possible lets try to do 6pm PST for the homies on the east coast
oof
what about 6?
agreed
well, at any point on friday 
or if everyone can do to friday i can go all day
same time as last week?
so we don't have to worry about carrying shit
bruh if that's your thing
hope you've got your pants on right.
Oh damn, thats too bad
so i guess i’m available whenever
 i got sick as fuck this morning, don’t think i can go to work anyway 
Idk.
i think so?
i'm busy from 11-5 and then it takes 30 mins or so to get home
i can't do 8 am
i can do 8 to 4 in the morn, sure
saturday i can’t start until at least 5:30 pm PST
yeah, can you make saturday?
b r u h, you said we were too quiet lmao
what's dnd without the shenanigans?
LOL
8 is like a mid to moderate fool
naw, dumbass is like 6
yea, fuck school
idk, depends on what class you wanna play :/
the 8?
who needs cha anyway?
you could put the 6 in cha
oof
also could have played from my phone
i coulda called anyone
kms
left it on my fuckin bed
ikr
all me
the locking myself out tho
wasn’t my fault the phone thing
im just kidding, plz dont kill my character
lul try me
i’ll most likely move the start time back an hour and be late anyway
we didnt
nope
20 mins ago
holy shit
im at work rn
wassup
maybe then you wont have to look at my ugly face
i should do a sketch as well
cool
we can just go
idk
rip
lol
and traffic is bad enough in LA
but they’re hell for traffic
they’re a nice meme
the birds
lol
eh it’ll be better to talk about it later
CRITICAL
OH
for sure
you can come at 6:30 lmao
coo
missing out or anything 
Starting at 5:30 pst, but you can come 6:30 you won’t be like
they're so good
aren't you 19?
that sounds like you're planning on hitting the bars
that's why
i've gotta walk my dog rn
but idk
we’re all lvl 4 rn
probably easier this way
lul
how's uh
oof
10pm?
you’ve got class, right?
well we wouldnt keep you up that late
oh thats not bad
next weekend is tough because they put me on friday night
oof
which means im done at 5
i work mornings on the weekend
wassup?
pst
saturday is fine with me
*im
qim mars
(tongueout)
but that's it
you could be a goliath, i probably wouldn't speak to you in character for the first couple weeks though &gt;.&gt;
jk ofc i'll save you my guy
and i'm awesome and you love me. suck my balls
and i'm awesome and you love me. suck my balls
spending all my money on healer's kits and stuff like that
uh i'm a rogue who's flavored as a doctor.
i haven't seen that yet
i haven't seen that et
that'll work
i had a character that we don't speak of who spoke fluent aarakocra, and eric didn't tell me no.
how's it goin, my dude
(ok) 
i'm not explaining anything, i already did my job
did you just say, "i'm michael?"
i'm mars.
i'll start with the introduction thing
you don't fucking like it?
im cool tho i can play absolver and be good
i was only pointing out that i suggested today and people said “ye”
b l e h
0
0 tact
parsa has
its more that
?
no
i thought we were gonna do the session with milo and jett and everyone
que?
idk
that’s understandable
y e a h
but cmon bruh, how u gonna be playing videogames when we get the boys together for dnd,
i do know that
and im just upset about that cause when you were paying attention it was awesome and im not sure what happened
but lets say we were doing dnd in person, jett you basically just said you spend the whole session fucking around on your phone until someone says your name
ofc, that’s understandable that you’d want out
if you’re doing things and putting forth an effort and not getting anything out of it
that makes sense
the whole point of the game is to do things
i probably won’t be making any friends saying this, but it’s not eric’s, parsa’s or my job to get you invested into dnd, if you’re fucking playing wow, of course you wont be invested
sor
that pended so hard
wow
neutral means neutral, generally
y o i n k s
nice
r i p
same shit
i was assuming contested lands
he didnt describe it
this is fuckin sick
oh holy shit
he's gotta have 0 int
and pray she doesn't execute us
i didn't miss it
i've been having a shitty day.
i get off at 4:30
is when im free
6
sun at like
i work night on friday
sat or sun
C A M P   P A I N   W H E N
yea
that’s revolutionary 
you can stack rage?
wait
lul
dont be surprised when our boy doesnt shill out
im not actually upset
ik
hell yeah
that 5 gold is worth 10 times less tho
i’ve only had 5 gold
r i p
5 gold
r i p
fuck it though, what we’ve been doing is fine
oof
my aunt's shouting rly loud
nobody’s whole foods until 7 technically 
we did say 5-6
thats fine
eric’s out?
ya boi too good
[1529277076] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: probably 5:39

&lt;&lt;&lt;  
look at that shit
and im back
I always do
wtf
:&gt;
: &gt;
*30
probably 5:39
fuck you milo
you bitch
I supp like a proper lady ought, it's just the quality of my meals that's declined
it's really quite worthwhile
what would you do with all that money? squander it, i'd bet.
i didn't actually have anything about lysandre in there
she's a "rogue"
parsa isn't an evil heritic, but i see what you're goin for
don't tell me we don't have lysandre
jett didn't make a new character, did he?
so i’ll let you guys know if i can get home early, but it’ll probably be like 6
same
4-10 was a joke
fuck off
i’ve been awake since 7:30
pay me no heed
im just retarded
Yeah we did
monday, any time between 4 and 10 pm
so fucj it
the less likely we have a whole foods scenario 
the wider the net is cast
Yes we do
5-7 start
that said, i agree, we should wait for him
fuck eric, we dont need him to confirm our decisions
and after that is lucky’s birthday fuckin party
dads day is breakfast for me
obviously we wouldnt be doing anything while dad’s day is active
well yea
im suggesting a course of action where i can make sunday dnd
eric’s first choice for dnd was sunday
same
let us not waste valuable days not doing the shit we want to do
immensely gay
no, that sounds
not both
but i can do one on monday
its just a regular job. my dad doesnt wanna be sued for nepotism or anything 
my boss is the manager
he just owns the place
but he’s not my boss
i am
yes
like 3-4
n stay until
9
and come at like
could site dogs as the reason why
try to leave my dad’s early on sun
or i could
in the group chat
and spoil the entire movie
i’ll see it on saturday 
idgaf
go see it tho
9-3
i’ll be at work from like
idk if it works for incredibles tho
fool
yes
i assumed milo’s yes meant jett’s yes
i said yes
cool
 peace
kms
and its gonna be a fucking crazy friday
i’ve gotta wake up at 7 wtf am i doing
she’ll be in the slaughter group
when the world goes through an eventual culling to thin the numbers
too dumb to live
thats the type of bitch who actually doesn’t deserve life
what the fuck
hence her being a fucking dumb bitch who’d rather rent a house in the city than live in the fucking pallisades
that bitch is stupid and worthless
of course they are
i’d dump that bitch
his wife is retarded
w h a t    t h e    f u c k
and the elevator permits expired in 2015
yet none of the amenities in the building work
and they just bumped the rates up a hundred fifty
the place im in now is 2.5k
5.5k y i k e s
luckily i could probably become a manager at my dad’s place in 2 years if i like pay attention.
im all for people living in their parents basements after looking at all this expensive ass fucking rent
fucking do it
if you can
like mine are
“fuck you eric, go get your own money, faggot”
you will when you move out and your parents say
well
thats the same with me on mornings
yea exactly 
tuesday and friday i work nights so that shit wont fly
tuesday and friday i work nights so that shit wont fly
i’ve got monday afternoon off, wednesday, and thursday off, then saturday and sunday off probably like after 6
so i probably won't be free till like 10-11
sunday is fathers day and my little brother's birthday
ikr
sounds about right
lmao
fantasy is usually more colorful until you need it dry
there's a difference
cause i don't know how to write fantasy
I'm sorry
it's just a little town
idk i like baronets
idk i like baronet's
that would make cio's uncle a baron. should i make him a baronet?
since cio's grand daddy is probably dead
yea that's how it's gone generally
it's named after the family line
yea man q
q
why dont you let the bibbas onto your island
yeah you racist fuck BITCH
 :/
real sor man. i didnt get to the part where i make it not espresso depresso
LOL
i was gonna tldr it and send you a less depressing one
bruh
you can read my unfinished, unedited, unadulterated shit
oh
fair enough man
dw
you dont have to walk any dogs tho
r i p
and it's about a half an hour away
Hot damn
just cause more info is always better
idk the princedom boarders would be nice as fuck
oof
which is fair since he didn't reroll anything
it'd be jett's ring if he did
it'd be jett's ring if he die
we're currently retroactively ruling that he did take it
but maybe the northernmost corner of Serthan's lands could work
prince Sadeas' lands?
they had to put him in the picture so he wouldn't get upset and have another seizure
we don't talk about the one on the left
when it's done
that's fuckin gay
you said you don't like them
eric didn't say you don't like them
that lysander didn't take his dope ass warlock sword?
you're telling me
so lysanderwould
that was why we didn’t loot him i assumed
^^
with him
i thought it turned to stone
 is jett back?
30 seconds
fuck
shit
to beat this mans ass
ive got one minute
one minute
i apologize profusely 
on accident 
mb
yea
trying to close that shit
i was fuckin
u fuckun nignog
or smth
i thpught he was gonna be there till like 9
spook me like that
milo dont fuckin
lol
w h a t
im gonna play some fuckin absolver for 30 mins and ignore any messages from now until 7
first time in a while that i’ve been home exactly when i say i will
ok im home
prob free by 6:30
then i’ve got a little bit of shit to do
im leaving work in a bit
ok
all because hansa didn't answer your questions to the fullest with everything he'd just learned.
or don't like playing my boi hansa?
are people thinking that i don't like hansa?
i don't remember what he sounds like tbh
that shit's good
i'll make you some fucking pasta aglio
doesn't scale like that 
would you say you're allergic
plantains don't even look like bananas
no he's right
when it's got sweet sauces it's awful
you don't have enough taste buds dude
at least the times i've tried it
green curry isn't usually that spicy
but she's not a person
don't believe everything you read on the internet milo
that's yellow
it's definitely predominantly yellow
who's to say that wolfgang puck doesn't pay critics to come to his restaurant
a mcdonalds burger doesn't cost 60 bucks
mcdonalds doesn't need reviews to get its customers
they're not spending more than 20 cents per plate on vegetables
indian food isn't about the meat
well that already sounds like it's gonna be shitty
that's
here's the thing tho
i should have just said "separate things"
and you can have cheap food that's good
because it's possible to eat good fucking food at any social standing
it's just bullshit
that's why i hate all black people equally until proven worthy of not being hated
it's not
it's also pretty fuckin expensive
but that one's wayyy more hippie than whole foods is
steak im okay with, but like i honestly don't like doing it
wait it's only 6
and he's on page 5
cause he's writing an essay
if i don't say anything it means it's probably not good
if jett doesn't say anything about it it means he's probably good with it
HE FUCKING SAID HE'S DOWN FOR FRIDAY AT 7
[5/30/2018 5:58:19 PM] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: yea he can&lt;&lt;&lt;
[5/30/2018 5:05:54 PM] Kappa Pride: except &lt;&lt;&lt;
im down to stay up till at least 5 on friday
then tell her to fuck off
r u getting paid?
so those times work pretty fucking well eh?
eric said friday at 7 right?
yea he can
lets do friday???
then
wtf you leave on sat?
due tomorrow?
10 pages
im not sure if i can make 5
6
sat afternoon,
helped, ez
???
in his car
he picks her up
for any of those days
so im good
i work morning shifts all weekend
lul
why not today?
its pretty simple to assume im not ready
and i dont respond
if you guys ask me if im ready 30 minutes ahead of time
so just saying
when's ur birthday, fucker?
which isn't bad on a non-school day.
which meant i'd be home by like 9
it's just monday
no it's not
i meant to ask milo how old he's turning.
YO WHAT'S GOOD MY NIGGUH?
dont at me nig
fuck you you’re in 2 campaigns at once
because giving you ammunition is never a good idea eric
but im not gonna let you see it
yeah i know
imma make the chat history available and add jett
i said some pretty gay shit, theres prime roast material in there
u wanna read the chat, tho? its cancerous and gay
mb my guy
right that was before you were added
O
cause i fuckin started a whole chat with all you bibbas for the sole purpose of telling everyone that they gotta confirm things in this chat so we all know whats up
*caps
im only raging in all chat
aight aight
IN CHAT MY DUDE
WELL THEN WHY NOT JUST SAY SO
and i didnt even realize
fuckin auto answer
skype
Yum!
its got some nice spice
monday between 5 and 6, when parsa's ready
i’m gonna roll lmao
cause my hair was a bird’s nest
and getting a haircut and shit
im coming back from work
i’m gonna role lmao
You rebel
What does?
that was a skype auto answer
Can you really?
back from when we thought we’d start lvl 3
lul
i already have em
this is dank
luckily i don't play dnd to win or anything
that's why it's #2 and syl returning is #3
dalinar's politics were better
dalinar's intro was the second best
of the 17 i've read
i'll believe you
i don't give half a shit about shallan, which makes it hard to get through those chapters
but because it's not paced i have to do the pacing myself
you don't get to see how characters change and grow when shit is going on all the time
keeping track of the little events that are happening when it's just unimportant nonsense is what makes it not boring
there's just too much shit going on in the stormlight books for me
it's called the name of the wind
the book isn't called kingkiller chronicles
a book doesn't need big important shit to happen all the time
coming from the guy who finished name of the wind and the wise man's fear in 4 days
except it'd be more like
like how i'm gonna be when i finish oathbringer and the next book hasn't come out yet?
like how i'm gonna be when i finish oathbringer and the next book hasn't come out yet&gt;
it's overrated
it wasn't
and it'll be awesome
they're gonna stuff like
but there's more than enough time left
up until then they're gonna focus on group dynamics and getting back edgelord and kokoro's memories back
they'll save that for the last two episodes
that's lazy writing
they can't just do shit out of the blue
there's still more show left
when 02 wants to have a threeway with her and hiro, then she'll be the most popular
like in terms of the show yeah, she's tied with kokoro.
like in terms of the show yeah, she's tied for kokoro.
ichigo's flaws are her attachment to hiro, she gets overly jealous, she lies, she's weak, she makes bad decisions, she's short, tittyless, and she cucks the shows biggest bro.
that's about it though
she'd probably have an empathy score of like 2 or three
she's badass
rey's running around
heath ledger's joker
you know who's weak
and we're gonna talk about fucking anime tiddies while you watch
but now that's over
those aren't qualities of maturity
she doesn't use that information at all
just cause she knows more about sex and shit doesn't mean she's more mature
it's like fucking a kid that has the body of an adult so it's legal
oh my god i just realized why she's everyone's waifu
no miku's gay
zorome's development got me impressed
thats cause the 9s aren't characters
cancer couldn't be cute
cause he's a beta
goro's a big cuck as well
so it doesn't matter
this scene doesn't happen in the show
&gt;paired up with a fat beta white knight cuck 
idk where you're getting the idea that she's dependent on him
it's still technically blocked
if you draw a vag in there you can't sell shit to like 13 year olds
but there isn't rly any of that on mangas
the show doesn't have any cause of censoring and shit.
like you know she tried to keep zero two out not because she's dangerous, but cause she's fuckin jealous as fuck
but that's the problem with going for a character who's whole shpiel is that she isn't human, but really really wants to be one for i don't know what reason.
that you aren't gonna be able to climb out of
stop saying things you're digging a hole here
aren't you the "flat is justice" guy?
crying bitches aren't hot
next time she puts it down she's gotta not be crying
then ichigo's eyes could have turned into hearts and it would have been legal
yeah, cause she's a slut
no she doesn't
yeah but the development didn't do anything aside from show why she's a slutty waifu who calls hiro darling
killing shit doesn't make zero two less one dimensional
there's no evidence to back up any claims
pretty sure they're just people who got dinosaur aids injections
cause they don't have any development
and they aren't even a good execution of it
they're the stereotypical evil counterpart team
naw he's a beta chasing anime tiddies
the show's wrong
that's cause the show pairs them
REEEEEEEEE
i’m a fiend and dnd is my crack
rescheduling gay
fuck that shit
heres the deal
but i dont think you guys are up for that
personally i could stay up until 5 playing some dnd sunday night, i dont give a fuck
i dont know for sure what will be good

also having a job is cancer
everybody and their fucking mothers always wants me to do shit

and this sunday i work at the same time
yesterday i got hone from work after 12
so
thats it
and item weights
its good for items
nothing
no spells, no monsters
generally only has 1 subclass per class. doesnt have any variant races
barely has basic rules
its got jack shit in it
so who cares
anyway
dragging from compendium gay
yes :(
that shit'd be hype
good
nice
ok
the earliest i see myself being home is like
idk
about tomorrow
what the fuck are you talking about you fucking autist shitbag
thanks
but all this campaign scheduling is for next week, right?
call me retarded
okay so
why are there so few and why are they never on time?
that shits cancer
i need to take 2 busses to get to work, but if the first one is 6 minutes late, it doesnt matter if i leave ab hour and a half early, im not getting to work on time
i want to stab this driver
i know
this is fucking cancer
all the busses are late as fuck and now i need to take an uber to work
i mean shit
cause he got the name professor singed
at least thats what i’ve seen of the dude in his videos
ints top and wins lane anyway
singed is cancer
and im on my phone
my fingers are too fat
my hand isnt even near the call button
fuck me, dude
that would have been so lit for anjing
the cantrip is new tho
eladrin got fey step in 3.5e too i think
“lord of greed”
vruh idk it just sounds cool
and mammon tieflings were the ones whose name i liked the most
mfw eao is just a mammon tiefling
its those dirty gith fuckers
naw its gith
oh hell yea
since like, there are a shit ton of features aside from horns that tieflings may or may not have
tiefling diversity is highly appreciated
no
?
unless its like already been out for a hot minute 
it might be a few days before you find a pdf you can pirate
oh fuck, nice
alright
i mean
if he cares about the big fuck up
im asking eric
i must have just added it as a "fuck it," since i got both medicine and religion for free from my background
it's not from my background either
that i had proficiency in perception 
and i forgot
ive got 16 wis
no
lul
16 wis
oh
monk bullshit
O O F
i’ve got 15
yeah thats me
naw
14 wis makes up for it
 hansa’s dick shit at most of this stuff too
force me to take the keen mind feat or smth
but i wanna do it anyway
 hansa’s dick shit at most of this stuff top
you’ll actually be able to use that
you’ll actually be able to do that
oh dope
and then like, the tracker is navigating 
yea i figure we wouldn’t be tracking unless theres something we need to track
oof
cool
yeah
*traveling
and we each get one duty while travelling?
i want to die of dysentery 
oh yes
 yes
it gives you all your daily necessities 
there you go
still gay af tho
dumb spell for plebs
delete goodberry
yea no
whoops
*ranger
why is there a spell that invalidates the hunter’s entire class
it makes too much
its still remarkably gay
no
too good of a spell
fuck goodberry
ik
food and water and exhaustion and shit
and survival
lets cover shit like terrain
plz
difficult
yes
if you don't have a female then you're not going
does jett have a thicc bih he's bringing?
and that's the earliest i get home this entire weekend
which means i don't get home until at least 7
he's a piece of shit
last night's session
is my excuse
traffic
but
i just said how much longer
i didnt make an excuse
5 mins or less
like
ok
s... ame?
nice
is that a goku black joke?
call me whole foods
will be like 15 mins late
tryna get home as fast as possible, but
im fuckin

idk if i can do 4 for sure
that was the dumbest way to say that
yeah
???
5ish?
later
it wasn't put here
i didn't know we had agreed on any date
personally i want today
my work schedule is nonexistent but i’ve got shit to do on sunday
camp pain when?
alright
ye
yea same tbh
if the need arises
i too can run minis
milo wanted to wait at least two more weeks i was told
pretty sure
so i bumped it
jett pushed a bunch of old chats up by leaving like 50 at once
yeah it's a pretty good time
we're only level 1.5
yeah that's true
you'd
i didn't think
dope, milo
im just asking cause i've never seen actual joints that big, unless they were like bought in a weed store, but you could roll a fucking monster blunt any day
actually, did you guys roll it yourself?
no the fuck it's not lol
i didn't say a super blunt
you've got 1 hour to drink as much water as possible lmao
I had about 100mg of cannabis and idk if I'm going to live to see the rest of the day
hey guys I'm sorry to be that guy but I'm a bit too fucked up to do this today
sounds good
5:30
im a monk
do whatever man
instead of a fighter?
oathbreaker paladin
or everyone
are youuu asking eric?
absolver&gt;league
r i p
for some reason
i didnt type that
no
wait
Sounds good to me
i’ll request to swap to a day shift on sat
lul
we give the two of them lvl 1 characters
milo can you play from matthew and tenn’s?
dnd on 420 sounds lit
to work
i’ll call in dead
ik
milo you get litty?
so friday or saturday

which would be dope
i might have a morning shift on saturday too
 and sunday
thurs or fri?
2
oh aight
i started walking my dogs 5 mins ago :/
you're gonna lose?
clash ghey
so when's the clash shit over?
i can
lmfao
not tomorrow
no
I can.
1 hour?
miles and parsa
k
yes
we do the lilith fight
tomorrow, some time between 5 and 6
dragon balls “D”
sakura yuan-ti
yall bibbas should do the oneshot that's a good idea
i know
yeah
and she’s taking me camping in like sequoia 
i just found out today
my mom’s coming
oh my 
its not an ideal scenario
yeah i know that too
yeah i know that
basically only free tomorrow
im
also
i still havent read ai’s but i can do that tonight
this iphone auto message thing is killing mr
yoinks
Probably never
gotchya
no evil shit
so
makes sense
yea
dope
what about a solid day of soul melting in the deepest layer of hell?
i see
i guess i've got some fuckin work to do after we kill lilith
honestly i didn't see a way where getting to end up in the jade gardens would have been a bad thing
im assuming that doesn't mean i can bring people back to life
she's got nothing
at this point Lyreth wouldn't really care
he couldn't reach her cause she was a goddess
i didn't even consider that
if fanvara's baby was born before fanvara became the Huntress, then its not like the baby is a demigod or anything
i mean i guess it's only in a technical sense in that case
i just don't know my dnd lore that well i guess
so Lyreth was just the literal descendent of a goddess and i didn't know
it literally says "I am Anyeira."
milo you're fucking retarded
i just didn't comprehend all of it
i wasuted earlirr
im havin issues connecting
refreshing
sure
*ah
ab
heading back to school on sun?
but i can make both
thurs
ok
at least sat night
im not good on saturday
or thurs lmao
ill be caster
ok
i can if nobody wants to
gemi gay
ew
yea
6-7
sorry
this is 5-6 sessions from now
this is pretty much always true
so... eh.
but Lyreth is a simple girl of simple pleasures
i’d be all about empire building
if i had yew
oh
we could do some monster hunting i guess
bringing them back in full force is similarly gay
thats kinda gay
kill all the gods?
what sort of epic stuff?
well lets do that then
i see
oh ok
ye understandable
you tossed us on the new continent and like that was the best bargaining chip we had in any scenereo
it doesnt seem like there was anything in the way of that?
but like
i so like i sorta get how lilith was supposed to be the finale
oh hell yea
im more attached to the story of yew and lyreth’s involvement than i am the characters themselves
as far as attachment
ye i cant say just yet
got work
cant
i cant say im insanely attached, but by lvl 20 i probably will be
fuck you man i like both ideas
but that's too badass
fk it just call em
well i can start soon if we need to i guess
ye
oh, damb
milo’s gotta go at 6?
the problem is that im waiting for them to call me and let me know she’s ready
not too long
pretty dope
i see
i think you need the membership to use the mobile
not sure about that part
i do
ye
the subscription version cones with it
i can try that
i can use r20 on mobile
actually
i’ll do my best to be there then
ok
you can start w/o me and fill me in
ahh
i’ve gotta pick up my dog from the groomer’s somewhere between 3 and 4, but when i get home from that i’ll be free
wrong chat fuck
I thought so
i was just meming anyway
lul
campaign tomorrow?
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Sekane's D
ya boy ready
i can't sat at all
ancilus when?
im tired af
didnt even realize i sent that
i
i didn't need to see that eric
but you didn't type that
it'll have nothing on
cause it'll have nothing on
don't make who's rook into a meme
(noworries)
they are
good question
B R I N N E R ?
the name that isn't gelanthriel?
yo eric what was that knight dude who was travelling with Lyreth's name?
lets dab upon all the downsies to prove our superiority
lets down upon all the downsies to prove our superiority

im not fucking with this one’s schedule
no
he just doesn't have a dick anymore
resistant to everything but psychic, omegalul
could still fuck you up though
lul yea, yew’s a bitch
shoulda known better than to fucks with sweetyew pravaal
now niggas are gonna die for his sins
well
yea
just hiding
for all you know yew has like an inny-outie
or my not-dick who even knows anymore
succ my dicc
yew’s ovaries are in a major twist over this, fuck you
that bitch ass is dead next time i see him
look at it this way
and that bitch nigga had the gall to send me home
its just cause we put him up there
except they didnt
yea his gigantic fuckin flaming gayness
like shitty carius
worth doesnt mean shit if he’s not lucky
ik
logic dictates gemi is a more worthy emperor
carius could not have done it without gemi at any point
fuck you and fuck this punk bitch too
that green patch there
that’s my rating of
thoroughly unimpressive, but not without potential
6/10
if you're not a bitch you have one version. and you don't compromise
if you're a bitch
you're the fucking ultrabitch now
didn't we say what'd happen if you changed it?
but we're not even going there
like i mean it's cool and all
why'd you make that map tho?
it can't walk or fly
so now you're stuck with it
if you get rid of it you're a fucking ultrabitch btw
it's good tho
2 many powerful good forces on this continent. not enough bad
11/10 would beat that dick like a cello
well everyone's on roll 20
are my lads approaching readiness?
i can't make 1
the other racials were what made it op
lul your character sucks then
i forgot that
oh
milo
though
you dont keep your aasimar stats
and 0 negatives
cause theres so many plusses
tbh playing as an eladrin isnt even all that fun
yea i see what ur saying miles
good point
and he's not going to know
this is yew's understanding of what happened
you just cant say it's good
it's okay to be bad
no he said that genocide is bad. not that it's not okay
it's wednesday lul
lmao
yeah
aight
oh
in 4e i think
its a player race
oh if yew is an eladrin now do i get fey step?
back now sorr
yes
means a ton bro
ok then, ty
there’s plusses and minuses to everything
eh
just for when i dm a campaign 
i almost wanna buy one of the subscriptions too tho
i see

 how’d you get it?
cool
i’m not home and i need to walk and feed dogs before i can do anything
any way we can push it back to 5:30?
k
naw
naw nigga
What the FUCK is that mustache 
ladies everywhere
and boom
im just gonna buy a long sleeved shirt
one day
townswemen upon meeting yew pravaal
“i need his autograph on my ovaries”
“wow so brave”
shadow gemi standing still just dealing massive damage
LUL
niggay
fuck you gaynigger
that cant play
only bibbers
nope
it rly does
that gif
kappa
for science
cheqir's mom is definitely not big gay
me too thanks
it's canon now
and give to me
pravaal doesn't even use arcane spells
yea man
idk summoning tyler 1 is also definitely not something i could see cheqir doing
and not "the caster"
that's the only scenereo where it'd fuck you up rly
cause you're not playing the game alone
yea but this is assuming you're not solo
so you'll never summon anything that's a threat to yourself
yea and assuming you're playing dnd you're not gonna be alone
considering at that point you're like lvl 17
that's pretty gay
im of the opinions that greater demons can be more creative than "oh we're free yes lets kill"
that's lesser and like middle tier demons
they're not mindless
why's it gotta just start combat
that's pretty dumb
i don't like that the demon is like compelled to attack any non demons after you fail the charisma check
especially if you're going for a necromancer
that's the best list for spells
r20 compendium is trasssshhh
i did cause i wasn't hearing anything
and we’ll have a new servant’s head on the mantlepiece at around the same time
we’ll have a new head servant within the week
its fine
or do you have to spell everything out for him?
he should have had room for rugs
i gave this nigga 9000
hundreds
and buy some fucking rugs
someone will sell a stupid 2000 gp couch
yes
and cut off his fucking head
tell them how retarded this man is
we gather the workers
yes
and we have rope
we have boxes
we have swords
yes we can
he doesnt deserve life
no we have him publicly fucking executed
you said that he’d make our house look like the house of the dude who lost his sword
its home furnishings
yea no thats bullshit, nobody would be that retarded to not include rugs and plants as furniture
its there
dont fuck with me
and PLANTS?
i get the lack of art but RUGS????
what the fuck i asked him to dress it up not just buy furniture 
so im now on record of having called it
me too, im just calling it ahead of time
sorry we wuz kangs
when we inevitably get cast out of the country, we can legitimately say we was kangs n shiet
like it fucked up
nah he’ll blame the furniture
lmfao
NIGGERS
THIS IS WHY YOU DROP 9000 ON DECOR
SEE
actually idk
it depends
thats fine
like if by long dungeon crawl you mean very spread out combat scenereo, then no
imo
it depends on how you do it
i didn't realize that
don't dragonborn have long mouths?
but don't they like have faces?
that's not our fault
unless we've met a bunch in disguise or some shit
cause if that's the case say no like wtf
i'd say you ought to tell us the race of a dude who's speaking to us, if it's very clearly not human
that's what we were asking
what the fuck? they're literal people shaped dragons
[2/10/2018 12:55:44 PM] [B]iles: sells crack&lt;&lt;&lt;
need to restart my computer real quick tho
i am
good store tho
trader joes
lul
its not like a flu
yea im fine
just that you do
so it doesnt matter when you show up
well good thing i’m sick as fuck and dying on the inside
then he's not back
if he's not getting these
so we're not starting for a bit?
there's no depth or anything and it looks weird as fuck cause of that
but the tattoo in the picture wouldn't be so shitty if it was real
looks like eric cant get what he wants
rip
lmao
lul
your age
or
i mean yeah at our age sure
thats surprising
really?
yea but you dont work there do you?
*sense
yeah that makes sende
in asia
thats the second most retarded thing i’ve ever heard
naw
still scary
covered in flower tattoos?
like a swole as fuck yakuza member
if you’re hard enough you can make it work
das a little gay
not so much the waves tho
you can get the dragon or the fish as a guy
tf
understandable 
i see
you just have to get a tattoo that isnt gay
you dont need to be a woman to get an elaborate tattoo
what?
thats what id do if i wasnt trying to save up to move out
just get one yourself
ive never been a fan of that shit
she’s got the really heavy jaw line thing though
a little
i cant type on my phone
yea see
but like for instance if she died her hair red they’d be the same oerson
but like the facial structure and the fact that they both probably take it up the ass three at a time ya feel?
naw i dont mean the edgy art shit the girl i know is more of a slightly slutty normie, 
that girl looks like someone i know
on another note
thats suitably creepy
nice
does it move?
yea i getchya
it cuts over half the necklace
and was made on a computer
only that isnt a tattoo
only that isnt a tatto
or mostly
yea im better now
so im free all day
so im not going to work
i just threw up like six times
okay
ancilus tomorrow 12 pm? or nah
use these ez ones
better maps
yes
yea
or draw a line across streets
and i mean we’d just put a circle
i like knowing where things are
well yea
i like how stylized this one is
i disagree
tf
looks like it took longer to make though
50 x bettet
you can actually mark streets and locations
20x better
better
fair
okay
so
wtf
also gemi is swole?
what is this for?
kms
and adidas
yakult
crayola
double cr double xp
lmfao
perfect
lmfao
i hope yall are ready
with quad disadvantage
im rolling for em
its true
and it only gets realer the deeper the purple is
parsa is right
wait wtf janet was photoshopped into there?
disgusting fake blond
its also
i just said 2
no
thats parsa’s number
2
ah
so i just have to nod and say sure
i actually don’t recognize anyone in that picture sans lily and poki
fed&gt;toast
he’s trash
lmao
[2/5/2018 1:06:38 AM] flatisjustice: but at least its the right shade&lt;&lt;&lt;
[2/5/2018 1:06:38 AM] flatisjustice: but at least its the right shade&lt;&lt;&lt;
i don't know what she is
[2/5/2018 12:52:14 AM] Ride Along 2: With Ice Cube and Kevin Hart: i was basing it solely off looks&lt;&lt;&lt;
lily's better
not who's better
but you asked who's hotter
but she's also a low-tier streamer
its more the picture's fault than her own
don't try to argue that that's not a bad picture
but she doesn't
i mean if she had different hair she'd probably win
lily's hairstyle is like
and janet's a little hotter than lily
who's yours, poki?
you're wrong
yea no janet's hotter than her too
i still don't know what the other fuckin bitch is
don't say leslie
but janet's hotter than both easily
they're all thots
it's just what it reminds me of
which isn't bad
it's like the equivalent of chopping at that point
it doesn't work vs armored opponents
you couldn't
it's just not gonna happen
if you're stabbing you're not pushing past those big spikes
the point of barbs are that they're hard to pull out
that's different
and then you've got the fact that skin is
shouldn't serrations make it easier to pull out of someone? like not these cause they're too big, but like compare cutting yourself with a bread knife to a flat edged steak knife
looks like it
that's how you win
because you spammed "niggers arent people"
it's not 12:00 am yet
wait that's fucking hilarious eric
and parsa's gonna let him live it down
im just surprised that i didn't notice
i've been using like 2-3 of my first level spells over the 3 days
tru
well 3 on
yea tomorrow post 3
we’re doing next monday morning
no
you aren't
her 2nd cousin’s birthday or smth
with some of me family
my aunt made me go to this dinner thing
but the scaling looks like it sucks dick
weird cause its broken as hell in early levels
this witcher class is like
so i can't select it to have the sheet automatically fill shit out
Roll20 doesn't have psion in it's shit
