Riot just keeps unlocking Thresh skins for me year after year. I'm not complaining but, wth lmao

Eric's up for it if we have 5 stack.
No, it's okay, lmao. I have the access already.
Would you be more interest if we had 5 stack?

get on league memelo
i am once again asking for your views on this video
Getting on league now
Alright
Around 6:00 vro
sounds like her
yeah
Eric and I
[b]eague anyone?
I had setup appointments to see the nutritionist there at SMC it really motivated see her often for ongoing months. She's rather mean but that's because she cares and she doesn't want to see people who don't want to put in the effort to help themselves
If you need help with nutrition, SMC provides free services to set up monthly/weekly appointments with a nutritionist to assist you on what you need to eat and what's a healthy diet for you
I want what's best for you so I thought this could be of use if you're having trouble with sleep
I've been meaning to try this experiment for some time
Ayy, my team won the whole thing. 1st place in Clash
Possible have a spot open for clash. Midlane. Who's interested?
Thank you

TFT time?

When I play Azir vs when <at id="8:milo.amoore">Milo</at> plays Azir.
Woohoo...
I finally got a toilet installed into my apartment!
Also...
Mmk. Gonna log on today to play
Who wants to play TFT with me when I get home?
Teamfight Tactics is out on the PBE, boys. 1v9 me
Especially if they're in my ranked game
Actually though, I'm just uncomfortable taking to people I don't know online
That and I just don't really have a preference towards any champion I don't want to play against
Stranger danger
I don't ask people if they want me to ban someone for them because I don't want to talk to people online
TFT will be on PBE on June 18th for testing and is expecting to release a week after.
 i wish i hadn't woke up
something that doesn't require much of my attention
i could do an aram if that's ok
b nice

I'm home
<at id="8:milo.amoore">Milo</at> Unrelated but, I <b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">genuinely</b> recommend that one. If I could only recommend one anime out all that I've seen it'd definitely be that one.
Kimi no Na Wa
Suggested phrases are great for my socially-inept ass
I'm 5min away from home.
 One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us.
We'll have you soon enough.
Soon
🤣
Alright, Milo. Now you must set up your Anime List account as part of the initiation of getting into Anime.
Perhaps. :T
Haha, yeah. I was playing around. I don't genuinely recommend it if you've liked Kill La Kill but I liked it : )<e_m a="classynoir" ts_ms="1552448668663" ts="1552448668" t="61"></e_m>

Kill La Kill is fantastic. I should rewatch it again sometime.
Oh, everyone signed up for the free trial?
Wait, what. You all got your own individual Crunchyroll accounts?

I'm functioning on 10mins of closing my eyes since yesterday and I want to fall asleep by 1am
Hi, could someone help me stay up
i think they removed the 'none' ban from draft in league
does that mean the story is consistent throughout all the games? like, same characters and such?
how many game are there in the series?
f u k
i've never played any of the metro games before but do you guys think exodus would be ok for me to start off with? i've always been interested to play the series
gringo
yes, i too have been dealing with crippling depression
you're telling me
Yes.
Would anyone like to go see the new lego movie with me tonight?
Gonna go for D1 in League this season.
I think I'll just stick to League. Wasn't my cup of tea.
i'm still in queue
nvm..
why didn't anyone tell me i had to accept queue 20 separate times before entering a game

Is it the backlash of the community?
Why are so many of the recent reviews &quot;mostly negative&quot;?

Hey, guys. I wanted to type out this to group chat to let everyone know what's been up with me. For the greater part of this year I've been depressed and partially suicidal (making multiple attempts at different forms self-harm) and I've just recently been trying to put my best effort forth to recover by going to therapy and making positive choices. With this is mind, I'm going to be keeping to myself for a bit to heal my mental and focus on myself. You still might see me around on League or elsewhere but I don't feel I'm in a good place right now to socialize with others in-person or through calls. I'll try my best to reply to any DM's though. Thanks and goodbye, for now.<e_m a="classynoir" ts_ms="1540567909293" ts="1540567909" t="61"></e_m>

Each of them costs $14.99 a ticket
6:30p, 8:30p, 9:30p would be our only options
These are the other times

The next showing would be at 12:30pm for $13.49. Whilst the one at 11:30am is $7.49.
Looked up the times we could go see the movie on Monday and 11:30am is the cheapest it'll go.

Cho'Gath also resembles Carnifex from Warhammer 40,000.
I sexually Identify as an the sun. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of slamming hydrogen isotopes into each other to make helium &amp; light and send it through the galaxy. People say to me that a person being a star is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon inflate me with hydrogen and raise my temperature to over 6000 °C. From now on I want you guys to call me “Sol” and respect my right to give you vitamin D and probably sunburns. If you can’t accept me you’re a fusionphobe and need to check your astral privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

obviously... 

Passive: All abilities except Q mark the targets. Mark probably deals bonus dmg when consumed

Q: Dash through an enemy. Resets on kill or when targeting a marked enemy.

W: Absorb all incoming abilities then throws dmg depending on the absorbed amount back in a line.

E: Send out a blade to one location. Reactivate to send a second blade to a different location. Then stuns every enemy between the 2 blades

R: Send out blade that fans out on first enemy hit and cages enemies (kinda like jarvan). Dashing into the cage gives irelia somekind of shield.

Fuck Ventura Blvd
I partially hated it though
Last night was definitely eventful...
I spent it walking alongside the same street LUL
It would have taken 4 hours but...
I could've walked it...
Y'know...
It was the only thing between me and SM
Is was a woods residential area
Is too sketch
the fucking residential area
I had planned to walk to SM but...
I basically told Danech to leave me off on my own
A
Y
We both got there from another party
I couldn't manage to charge my phone at the restaurant though because my phone was having problems
We went to a nearby restaurant to wait out the surged prices and Danech had to go elsewhere, to his gf's home
I was with Oliver and a group but, from the party we were at only a portion of our group left to the next location (A friend's home) and I was  left with Danech and his gf
Mmm...
Places were closed really early in the morning so I had to spend my time walking along a street for an outlet
Well...
1. I couldn't charge my phone
2. Lyft prices were surged
3. I had no directions home
I thought you asked where
Oh...
Encino
Me too, thanks
Real shit?
Being homeless for 9hrs was interesting to me
...by accident
I fell asleep : (
u're a pankek
kill me
I'm dead inside
Finally making my way home now... I'm exhausted...
My phone's been discharged all this time but I luckily found a public outlet LUL
I spent the beginning of it outside in the cold with no direction home but I've finally found the chance to say that...
Hey, Happy New Year's guys...

Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture
Or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[x2]
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[x2]
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[x2]

&quot;reminder: tour is tomorrow!&quot;
2 hours later...
only just yesterday I the email
they warned me so late that i was accepted to go on the tour though lol
free swag
free sign-up
attending the tour was literally a win-win
i also got an x amount of rp added to my account
and an iron-on
a wristband
a melee minion plush
yes
gold 3 on kr lul
i met a really good player that came for the tour too
no
here's what the pc bang looked like
but i don't remember
i think I might've
i didn't see shurima <ss type="sad">:(</ss>
bilgewater has office names like twisted fate and gangplank
in the sense that they name sections of the building after a league city or place
their offices are actually designed like the lore
i really enjoyed it
it was a really great tour
that same hq
in na
to get a sense of realism
they even made a very own pc bang at the hq for inspiration reasons and such
sorry, meant pc bang
no
this fact is nuts
fun fact: 50% of league's playerbase plays from pc bong's in korea
unforunately
not the same voice actor as darius in-game though
Yes.

Don't you mean you want to see the censored notes?
It's just exciting to be around people who have the same interest as you.
Overall though, it's like a going to the worlds finals.

It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
I thought not.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?

How long will you be in town for?
Fair enough
That's up to him though. You're setting these expectations on him to have already learned these concepts he's shown no interest in to apply in his games
I actually think I enjoy it most of all because he has a good middle ground of playing the game for fun and as well thinking proactively
I don't mind it really
Because of his relationship with you.
As well, I'm sure he just doesn't like listening to your shot calls
I'm sure he aims to play the game for fun. While you try to learn from your mistakes each normal game, the lot of us just like to enjoy the game rather than challenge ourselves to do better. Neither approach is bad, just different
Were you flaming?
It be like that sometimes
pata lol
It's pre-school drama.
You're right.

when we were planning to play league
koda
this was 2016 i think
look what i found
oh hey 
just standing in his corner
he was pretty edgy
i wanna see more of that eric guy
yeah
I'm not sure how long it's going to air in Cali so I'm probably gonna go either way this Thurs
Oh
Knowing Milo, the price will probably deter him
Or 30m by bus
Like an 11min drive from SM
AMC Century City 15
It's $16.49 a ticket tho
I think I'm planning to go see it in theatres
Are you interested in seeing the My Hero Academia movie?

Hey, wanna do it tmrw instead? I gave away my shift

Same
We could play Mario Tennis as well
See if you can get in contact with Milo to see if he wants to join too

Mmk, Oliver and I got one of the projects done
You can come over when you're ready
Mmk

i want to return it during my lunch or after work but i'll be leaving around 6am tmrw
