I’ve been listening to a lot of west coast rap lately 
So 
And I appreciate that 
You’re much more willing to serve eldritch gods than I would have presumed 
But it’s hard to do shit when your mind is acting as a medium through which extra-dimensional demigods contact this world 
I realized one time 
But becoming one with the Ancestral Spirit is not an enjoyable existence 
Hate to break it to you mars 
Most can’t close it
That’s the issue with opening your third eye 
I’d let you fly a plane rn 
Seem pretty lucid to me 
And you’re shitting on 4kids 
I mean, you passed the chad test 
“The descent of this mighty creature will be heralded by burning winds and twisted lands. And with the coming of this horror, those who draw breath will know the true meaning of eternal slumber.”
Easily best god card 
I fucking love obelisk
He looks like obelisk the tormentor 
His legs are just bigger than yours

Not sleeping is like 10x worse than sleeping a couple hours when it comes to maintaining a stable connection with reality 
Oof 
Ya know ain’t a bad idea 
Because she loves wires

so controversial and 
now this is an opinion i can fuck with
Just an interesting quandary 
I mean, it ain’t like I’m a fan of incest 
But yeah, I think between consenting adults, there’s no other ethical rebuttal than inbreeding 
Of course there are big issues there 
I mean I ain’t talking about anything involving minors 
Maybe I’m just retarded 
I mean isn’t inbreeding where most of the taboo of incest comes from? 
gay incest is more ethical at least xdddd
linus said trans rights
No tengo beta 
I’d play with y’all, I’m shitty at shooters too xD

Bruh have you ever gotten handed a cosmo by a beef cake 6’5 black dude with no shirt? 
Because it’s hotter 
Yeah that’s true 
Xddddd
Good breast too 
I’ve heard they have good wings ye 
Idk, I’m glad femboy hooters doesn’t exist, I think it would create more questions than it answers xD 
I mean
If one wanted to see a bunch of twinks in croptops and shorts wouldn’t they just go to a gay bar? 
Aren’t titties the only defining factor of hooters? 
Femboy hooters is pointless 
Wait I just realized 
He’s like 7 feet tall 
Owl is great 
I prefer using drugs to induce anxiety xDDDDD
Not that he deserves sensitivity 
IM SORRY I was just joking <ss type="sad">:&lt;</ss>

Didn’t he have a psychotic break? 
Everyone laugh at the retarded dog 
Daddy Duncan 
As a chaotic neutral, I’m okay with these classifications

Turning on the pc 
Did someone say league?
The duck is the correct choice, he can take off the green onions and open the eight gates like Rock Lee

Idk why I clicked that link 
Well
God this city looks great 
Can a man who is perpetually asleep be knocked out? 
An offering of slowthai to help in these troubled times
That’s a much more reasonable guess xD
Or the barrel of a mortar? 
It just had a large woodwind kinda vibe to me 
Ay why the fuck haven’t we ever smoked out a didgeridoo 
What a fucking lad 
This is 2016 levels of spicy drama

A handful are under prisoner control 
27 prisons in Italy are rioting 
I mean 
I’m just saying shit can go bad real quick here during the perfect storm
I mean i don’t really care bout China 
Because I think you’d really enjoy it LMAO 
Are you into bdsm? 
I think, if our government overstepped their right to martial law in the eyes of the people, a lot of damage will occur 
Guerrilla warfare is effective for a reason 
Tanks don’t work well when against ants 
The Chinese don’t have guns 
2 strokes and 3 jump cuts, so his brain stopped working 5 times in 4 minutes
okay 
HOLD ON I need to count 
HE HAD ANOTHER
alright he had 2 strokes in the first minute
he sounds sick 
and i really want to see conservative libertarians have to riot against Dictator Trump 
corrupt politicians 
a corrupt healthcare system
all the shit going on in our country 
we deserve this 
see
if anything
i mean 
3% chance btw 
idk, smells like we are awfully close to martial law
but like 
they want to save themselves
i don't really get why the world is breaking down over this 
re gonna pay for that
i feel bad for people who'
this shit is wack
oh gotcha

Would be worth at that point
And hopefully trump 
I still wanna see Bernie debate Biden tho 
TOOK A LITTLE TUMBLE DOWN THE STAIRS 
... 
Would be a shame if he 
But not by running a campaign on taxing corporations for the benefit of individuals xd

Nah I mean, no one can blame you for keeping your best interests in mind. I just realized conservative economic policy wasn’t benefiting me nearly as much as I previously thought 
But that’s just 4 me 
Used to be my preference as well 
I prefer my reptiles in glass boxes, not the Oval Office 
But I guess that’s cuz they are boomer women 
It tilts me how much boomer women love Hillary and Warren

There is no other way 
It’s how we operate 
Nah it’s just for women born after 1993 
Fucking 
So WTF riot 
Yeah 
They’re just stat trackers
I still don’t understand what the... point of eternal are though 
The rp ones are champ specific and the non rp once’s are like “basic 
I just don’t like that Biden got out of bed 
#BernieHoes 
I still believe in Bernie 
Y’all remember the Adobe Air client?

 this is mike myers 
but this isn't mike myers, its Michael Blakey 
and theres this youtube channel that tours mansions and I thought Mike Myers was the host of it
ok one of my favorite pastimes while high is watching mansion tours because idk, its funny how people with too much money spend their money
I JUST GOT MY MIND BLOW
WHAT
OH 
Don’t forget to vote daddies 
This is not fun at all 
And I was like wow 
Idek I just distinctly remember when I played against the Hamster for the first time 
And then they broke original heroes
And they never fixed them 
Yeah but newer heroes were released overtuned
Tf2 was great, shooters don’t need abilities 
I mean, gameplay at the beginning was fun 
And that retarded loot system 
As well as player base 
Mechanics and balance was the problem 
The ip or gameplay wasn’t the issue tho 
Overwatch sucks balls 
To be fair 
I mean 
But not a lot 
I guess this shooter has some uniqueness too 
I mean 
League has unique champs tho 
Yeah! And they thinks it’s okay because they split his vision into TWO different abilities and have his ultimate 3 charges 
These guys are relentless with their copying 
Ah yes 
Hanzo
I feel it
tis the season to be ill

We’re minorities you know 
No one has ever been jealous of a gamer 
Funny in an epic way not a good way 
I mean 
It is funny how blatantly against Bernie the liberal media is tho 
About what’s wrong with our political system 
That says so much 
Or is it too late for that 
Can’t you register online parsa?

You might become less of a spergy boomer 
If you beat dark souls 3

You ain’t a boomer till your hair starts receding 
So it’s less harsh 
We know how to already 
I know but like 
Because we know how to boom?

Wtf 
This exact shit happened like 60 years ago 
I like the sound of this 
Is this another red scare 
“Communism”?
Because 
Oh 
Play seems kinda scuffed 
Idk 
By supporting Bernie they do increase the odds of that 
Though 
Russia only wins if trump wins 
Hm idk, supporting both sides isn’t huge brained 
Who is also electable because of his beard 
This is what a man whore looks like 
He’s a remarkably bad manwhore tho
He doesn’t look like a rat... he kinda looks ftm tho ngl 
He looks electable with beard 
Okay so 
what are we sticking up our butts? 
private islands are just for pedophilia 
and the dots all connected
and I saw it
another pedophile who had like 8000 photos of underage kids on his private island got a law suit filed against him
Nothing good ever happens on private islands

because eventually, they fall and whine about it like little bitches. 
im fine with people who subscribe to that philosophy
yeah, stealing from natives wasn't very cash money either lmao 
i mean the whole cold war was a disaster 
but nah we really fucked up South America 
idk, i was resistant to what they were saying while i was in the class cuz it just all felt like hate against white people 
cuz like
it was interesting studying all that shit in my latino studies class
but like, we can agree that if we actually tried to help them instead of whatever corporatized interests we currently pursue, it could be beneficial 
yeah that's true
that's some beta shit 
with instating dictators because we were scared of communism 
or a lot of south america
ie the middle east
its just dog shit when we make problems
cuz they are gonna be are problems eventually
yeah i mean i do agree with jared
oh totally 
but its ideal 
maybe its like too hopeful 
i mean there are possibilities for both sides to gain doing that
idk, I wish we could help those war torn countries where the refugees are coming from so they don't have to come ya know? 
but it is what it is 
which sucks
Bernie doesn't like ubi 
than to be forced to debate with trump 
its better to quit with dignity

Of course my ancestral energy is just getting raped LOL 
I went to the cave, shit had crazy energy 
And the Vikings smoked them out, but most of them suffocated in the cave 
The women and kids hid in a cave nearby 
Well, they came to the village of Mohil 
Where my people were at 
And they came to do Viking shit 
It was actually a big ass tragedy <e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1581110419550" ts="1581110419" t="61"></e_m>

Viking dudes turn me on like crazy tho 
Relatable 
What a dialectic we have made 
That’s true that’s true
The actual men of Russia are twinks who drink vodka and squat in the streets while yelling at cars 
But then again 
Which is why I say communism makes hotter men; chiseled, tough, proletariat hotties 
But I wouldn’t define men who are overly involved in their image like that attractive 
Oh totally 
Whereas like, if it weren’t for rich capitalists, those Eastern European girls wouldn’t be able to use their looks 
Makeup, plastic surgery, clothes, skin care, drugs 
Oh I mean, I agree that Eastern European women are beautiful, I mean they’re my type for sure if I were to pursue that 


But like, because capitalist systems allow women to sell their beauty as a means to sustain themselves, it cultivates markets and phenomena which are designed to enhance and capitalize on that beauty 
Whereas in communist societies, women don’t really give a fuck about looks Bc they just have to work like everyone else 
They wouldn’t put in the effort to look good 
Like, if they weren’t gonna be bought 
I know but the transaction is still “capitalist” ya dig? 
Still a capitalist market though 
So they get sold off to men here 
Well it’s cuz they don’t have any means to capitalize on their hotness in their own country 
No cap 
Communism makes hotter men 
Capitalism makes hotter women

breeder 
life has no purpose unless you give it one 
it postulates that reproduction in itself is the goal 
well, i think the hypothesis is kinda inefficient 
yeah im just saying mmost ace people do seek companionship 
just not interested in sex
ace people still date
thats a misinterpretation tho 
tru
more gay people 
i dislike people who choose to be assholes

Chad is a chad

I guide others to the chadness I cannot possess

I forget which president 
No he’d like call people in to talk to him while he was in the bathroom 
LETS MAKE A PODCAST 
It’s definitely the same, I don’t have time to deal with you... oh wait I do, come see me while I’m eating/taking a shit 
It reminds me of that 
You remember the president who would make people talk to him while he took shits? 
You know?

Not if you hold her by the neck Eric 
You’re giving up a lot 
You can’t fuck in the shower if she is shorter than you milo 
It is a straight relationship 
I mean, my boyfriend is shorter than me and I do not come off as dominant in his presence LOL 
6’2.5 baby 
BUT ITS HAPF AN INCH 
I’m so fucking happy
I mean it was only half an inch 
Dude I’ve shrunk 
Nah fuck that, you’re a king milo 
<ss type="wink">;)</ss> 
MARS DONT BREAK ALL THESE ASIAN GIRLS 
Latinos and Asians are too short 
I stick to white and black 
I don’t want children at all atm 
It’s just not “normal” 
Even crippling autistic people can have fantastic ability 
I mean some of the smartest people are mentally ill 
It’s just a mental deviation away from the norm. Autistic people are very skilled 
Autism isn’t a bad thing. 
Imo 
Having a kid isn’t about personal rewards though
Which isn’t an issue, it’s just a fact 
Because it takes so much more effort 
I mean, the only kids I’m having are gonna be adopted 

But if I had an autistic child I probably wouldn’t have another so I could be a good mom for that kid 
And they’re still people, very decent people. 
Because I know autistic people? 
Because twenty years ago I’d be considered mentally ill? 
Why should people’s fates be a matter of luck? 
So you admit you were lucky? 
He’ll make a good dad once he learns 
But any parent that cuts of their child is a failure 
Your grandpa was a failure then as a father 
No offense 
Would you really say he wouldn’t deserve a good life? 
What if your son is autistic Eric? 
You can be ambitions for more than profit 
And you are only focusing on certain strengths
Strength is subjective 
I’d rather teach my kids how to love and be loved and appreciate life 
Doesn’t matter they will die too 
It will mean nothing at the end 
That you work so hard for 
This progress amounts to nothing 
Not really, everyone dies eventually 
I don’t give a flying fuck about progress 
Life is whatever you make it Mars 
Your opinions aren’t reality 
More to life than grinding 
You think it’s lazy 
Wrong 
Yup 
If they want to 
And those who aren’t have to work hard to become one 
Not everyone is born a genius 
You gotta be high strung to get really good 
Hmmm
Cool is just a reflection of society 
Yup 
You just have to be psycho to put up with the bullshit 
Which isn’t even a bad thing 
And they are psychos 
I know a bunch of people at the top of their fields 
Come up to Gualala with me and talk to some spiritual guides if you wanna find chill people 
C level employees are not chill 
Just do better lul 
So would all of us 
So would I 
But you would be in the ground without a government 
I know you like the be edgy 
He is trying to revert us to a gender binary system in terms of healthcare 
I mean, 
Trans military ban
That whole discussion about whether sexuality is protected by anti discrimination protections in the workplace 
Idk I just legit feel unsafe with the judges Trump has appointed 
Yuup
He bring us closer to social and economic equity 
Nothing is getting fucked by Bernie 
It’s not gonna get fucked by Bernie 
Stop being an ignorant cunt you know what this president is doing 
And life really has the potential to get worse for me if trump continues to legislate against trans people 
The course is terrible right now 
Things haven’t been unchanging, things have been moving in the wrong direction 
Me 
But I don’t get influenced 
I am a little bitch 
Yes

&quot;jokes have the potential to be funny&quot; LMAO 
i really like that line milo 
and homophobic its funny 
he is so white bread
well no one wants pence running the government
he said he won LMAO 
regardless of whether they meant for it or not, the American public does not trust the electoral system as much now 
its all political 
but totally
and about signaling 
unless you want to get caught 
or, i think there is a possibility they wanted to be caught 
see i just think they wanted to be caught 
imo at least
and the costs of calling this incompetence when it is actually corruption is too high 
i guess like the way i think about it, we need to look at the costs of making type 2 error  around this 
is it a conspiracy though? its literally just an intentional shitstorm 
the first thing you do is claim you didn't know better
if you ever get caught doing something wrong
like 
incompetence is a great excuse
i mean 
how? can be buried
this is the simplest answer though 
see
or by both sides
by the DNC? 
Are you proposing this is authoritarian pseudo-disruption? 
THIS IS AWESOME the world is falling apart with me 
I fucking LOVE the anarchy 
this is CRAZZY
wait plus there has been a lot of false information spread around this 
yeah I mean they got paid by the DNC too and prolly got tax benefits 
exactly
yeah
no no like, heres what im saying... what if buttigeg bombed his campaign on purpose 
TOO suspicious? 
a little 
doesn't this seem 
wait hold on hold on 
how much did he pay shadow?

AND THEN YOU POST THAT 
BANS ME FROM DND CHAT FOR POSTING MILKY COPY PASTA
LMFAO 
It is pretty interesting though, I’m very intrigued by that shit 
And also the entire process of drill training is to make you feel like a worthless piece of property 
Firstly the military puts saltpeter in the rations of soldiers in combat do decrease sex drives 
That’s false though 
Sissy hypnosis would be an effective military training tool

Meh the chinese government is shit 
It did inflate GDP but that doesn't mean anything important
Yes, GDP isn't an accurate measure of how well a country is doing
okay your ideas about economics are just wrong
chinese wages are shit
The worker's? not decent, they're Chinese nationals 
Not construction
Outside firms invest in manufacturing
construction of housing is NOT what the majority of FDI goes towards in china 
wait
wait
yeah totally
by the government literally paying them for nothing

and im hyped UP on 300mg of caffeine
because i just drank a bang
you should read Guns Germs and Steel Eric
we aint doing that shit 
yo quit arguing over semantics
youve said before people just need to work to get good
wait
Life is a game for you because you are playing easy mode eric
im saying milo like, every able person has the potential for excellence, but the conditions in their lives often prevent rapid growth 
most people are excellent at something, but most people never get to exhibit their excellence 
excel at mcdonalds
and rent 
16 year olds work to help their family buy food 
what about the teens that have to work to help their family survive
its an issue period
children are homeless
thrown out 
so many lgbt youth get disowned
bigots and cunts eric
but god i was close to being alone 
thankfully i am 
didnt think id be able to rely on mine
you cant always rely on family
not always
and a safety net if anything happens to any of us 
and better social services
i gain healthcare
no at our gain 
millions would benefit in america
if some of what they have was redistributed
we just think
we dont want to actually kill the rich
thats not the question though
we want equity 
we arent making their lives unbearable
we aren't killing the thousands
at all 
its not 1 to 1
xd
thats so edgy 
Why would it? 
The idea of your kin 
Hmmm
If you don’t need it to live 
Then why do you want it 
You haven’t earned your billion either 
and if you don't believe that go back to yellow land
our country's problems are your problems too 
hypocrite
you literally blame the poor for this country's ills 
You gain nothing from billionaires existing 
Eric why are you sucking off a couple thousand people that give you nothing? 
And it affects so many people like me 
It does affect me 
Because spawning at the right place is playing well
That would hurt others 
I don’t want to be that rich 
Fuck off 
Like cancer deserves 
They must be removed 
Billionaires are cancer 
We agree 
If you know what I’m saying

You don't know anything real estate and your too young, ignorant and uninformed. I work for real estate industry and he's number 1 in the world period. Ask the listing agent that placed this home in the marketplace there are buyers out there willing to purchase a lifestyle. It's not about the cost it's a very big world out there! you got options, choices, and freedom to make lots of money.

Not in the gay way 
Jk ily 
I’m bored of you already 
EvanGAYlion
Weird flex 👀👀
<ss type="surprised">:o</ss>
*?
*ride would you make your dick biggerv
In that view 
Is dying after a near infinite life is just the same as a short one 
The weird thing about that tho 
What if the answer is bleak I mean? 
Would you wanna know tho? 
Because he likes efficiency 
THATS WHAT WERE SCARED OF 
Until I got bored 
I’d stay carbon based honestly 
I mean superiority doesn’t really interest me 
He chose to turn his mind off 
After floating through space for eons 
And so 
Kars couldn’t chose to die 
At least, as a self 
Existing forever would be a curse 
Well that’s scary though 
Not the purpose LOL 
The skin I mean 
Like some sex doll shit 
I would but only if I get a squishy cover
See that’s true, but they still replace right? 
So like why the fuck is consciousness continuous 
And your body loses billions of cells each day 
That 
Yes 
Piece by piece 
You know that paradox where they rebuild a ship 
Like okay 
Well if you get unplugged you’re done 
And you can get corrupted too 
So why couldn’t it be fluid in a different piece of biological hardware 
I’m just saying the self is very fluid 
And every moment we change as people as well 
Or, taking estrogen has had dramatic effect on how I interface with the world
Like, when you’re on a heroic dose of mushrooms, are you really you? 
Chemical changes in the brain can DRASTICALLY effect how the self interprets both itself and the world 
Like 
But also, the instability of consciousness makes me question it too 
Let alone transferring it 
Idk how removing the self from the biological body would even work
But like 
And you’d still be conscious 
It makes total sense that your brain could exist outside your body 
Okay 
Lik 
I think about that a lot 
V a li d 
But you can change things 
Like, let’s say in 60 years. And you have an opportunity to get your 21 year old body again, 
Cuz I feel like that’s gonna happen in the not too distant future 
Okay question 
If you could grow a new body for yourself, and transfer your consciousness into it:
Would you do it? 
What would you change? 
☕️
And apples breed apples as they say 
Are the sports car of clothing 
Track suits 
I completely support 
Which checks out 
Track suit is a vibe 
I don’t want people to remember what I wear 
I worry about that shit 
Go on
I apologize for my weird flex 
Oh
;)) 
I ALSO PASS WITH NO CLOTHES THO 
College is daycare 
That’s funny 
Maybe so 
Not working at Uniqlo has feminizing effects? 
Cuz like it’s only been 9 months 
Yeah I mean it’s pretty profound 
Cuz I am a lot smaller than I was 
I feel tiny in my jacket now 
But I like boyfriend jackets LMAO 
Because you don’t wear baggy clothes 
*tall 
That’s the problem with being y’all 
I mean like 
But yeah idk it’s a struggle still 
It’s true they will boom 
Unless it’s like a boomer or idk, my parents LMAO 
Or at least that’s what I think is the reason, I can’t know how I’m perceived ya know? 
Which is why I hate winter now LOL can’t show off my tits 
I mean that’s a complex question <at id="8:milo.amoore">Milo</at>, if I’m wearing feminine clothes, it’s basically near 100%. But like, I think it’s more cuz they get I’m presenting feminine not that I tricked them into thinking I’m cis or something 
because trying to stop dozens of nukes from hitting you is hard apparently xd
but its really shitty
we have the GMD <at id="8:milo.amoore">Milo</at> 
40% accurate 
plus the GMD is like 
I mean, we stopped funding the multiple kill vehicle project in like 2009 
there are no defenses stationed protecting LA that can stop them 
or at least
there are no defenses capable of stopping MIRVs 
: ^ )
Plus they have a debuff to their constitution mod from atrophy cuz they can’t eat 
They never tell you that, meth heads lose advantage on their rolls if you’re high too
Unless I’m tweaking too 
I just don’t wanna have to defend my position against methheads 
Oh I can definitely fight trans girls 
I could get it after they’re done booling 
I guess they’d leave the estrogen tho 
Meaning, they’re the first place people will raid to get pain meds 
I feel like they’re high priority targets in case of civil distress 
I’d need to raid a pharmacy though 
I guess my prison and war plans can be the same 
Being a sex slave would be ok I guess 
Same 
I mean 
I should get a gun before the boogaloo starts 
Yeah 
Because LA and SF are pretty good targets 
I don’t wanna be caught in the crossfire 
Honestly, this is why I wished I lived in like South Dakota or something 
Yes 
It would be Pearl Harbor 2
I have a feeling 
Like 
I’m interested what would happen if they bombed his hotels 
Yes? I got a better ass than your gf 
Very halal 
At least you remembered the mat parsa 
Sure you were bby 
Truly relatable 
Very sad 
“Yah suree”
Rohit deflected that thot so well
Yo
But the idea of Descartes as a battle tested warrior is good  
Idk why 
Since I have a thing for that apparently 
But bucket heads seem to be my type 
I’m not super into military uniforms 
Nah, I mean line police uniforms are hot 
ITS NOT MY FAULT UNIFORMS ARE HOT 
I’m down for more soldiers tho 
I’ll add to this 
Or are disabled 
You can’t be drafted if you need regular medication 
I mean getting paid to get screamed at by men is basically what I do anyways so... military never sounded too bad to me 
And I got no money 
They made me

I'm going to force every inch of my big fat cock inside your tight innocent cunt and watch that gorgeous good girl face of yours when you whimper and whine from how good it hurts you to be torn open like an useless slut. I'm going to spank your white ass bright red when I fuck you and demand that you cum on my cock until your limp little body can't take another orgasm. I'm going to fuck you until you need me.

I can’t think of that length 
Gorillas are crazy 
Loss of brain function be a bitch 
I doubt I could kill anything 
If I was bleeding out through my neck 
I mean 
I don’t think gorillas are so combat oriented tho 
Padded or not, they just need to poke through 
They still have arteries in their necks 
But smooth brain 
Until they know 
Because the gorilla doesn’t know it’s a fight really
The human would have the first attack 
Listen 
Okay
But like okay
The body builder has a knife 
Methed up body builder vs regular gorilla 
Wait, let’s make things interesting 
it’s an amazing sport 
METH GORILLA FIGHTING 
Beats all tho
Gorilla on a high dose of synthetic amphetamines and mushrooms 
Tigers are crazy 
But gorillas are higher tier animals 
Okay, lion could kill a gorilla 
So do I 
It’ll be a quick end 
I don’t think the gorilla’s force will matter 
Like, specially trained to rip the neck off of anything it wants 
Lion is like assassin style 
It just needs to bite the monkey’s throat and then it’s over 
Claws+teeth 
Think about it 
Probably the lion dude 
Smart like a true Jazz man
Intelligent of you 
Until you do 
You can’t understand 
Go ahead 
Go ahead 
Theorize

Ykwim? 
To see that turkey get stuffed

Yes but all this takes time, and many people don’t have the time to reflect on everything they do retroactively and find what their best path is and then figure out to apply the solution 
But arguments of what is “better” are mostly futile. For most things there’s no objective truth about what’s good and bad 
I mean, isn’t that too high of a standard to apply to anyone? 
You can’t expect the self to solve every problem the moment they’re recognized 
It’s fine to ignore our problems, because it is only when it becomes too costly to ignore them that we decide to fix them 
Inconsistency between your actions and your wants drives change 
And struggle is good, it’s part of being alive 
Or the difficulty to obtain that ideal 
It depends if your ideal is impossible or not 
Or at least totally indivisible in the short term 
And the third one is in a way a necessary evil, as long as we are human it’s difficult to separate ourselves from the perceptions of others 
Incongruence between the first two can be very painful 
But there’s a distinction between what  you are, what you wish to be, and what others see you as 
Like when you’re tripping on psychedelics and you feel at peace with yourself because you feel at one with the world 
I just think a route to happiness is to let go of our individuality 
I’d rather everyone set aside all our distinctions and just BE together 
But it seems like the universe drives us towards oneness/singularity 
Well, I guess this is just my personal philosophy influenced by Buddhist thought and psychedelics 
In an esoteric way 
But also I think individuality is futile 
Because changing the beliefs of our entire society can’t happen in an instant 
That would be ideal but we need  solutions in the meantime 
Well I guess it’s more beneficial for minority groups. When society doesn’t seem inclusive to oneself it’s easy to find a faction to be with people like themselves 
It’s hard to be a lone wolf 
I just would avoid disregarding the beneficial effects of group identity. Of course it has detrimental effects in certain situations, but being cognizant of those effects can help us avoid said pitfalls 
I guess I just wonder if fighting our nature is beneficial. I fully support introspection and finding your true beliefs and alignment, but at the end of the day people seek engaging within communities 
We are pattern seeking brings though. It would be nice to separate ourselves from our nature, but we seek belonging and we seek power in numbers 
Imo at least 
Well you shouldn’t let extremists cause you to not identify with a certain group 
Yuh I mean good things get taken too far 
If it accurately depicts real life 
The ideology that minorities exist? I mean women aren’t a minority. The fact that the movie was written with the scales tipped so far isn’t good. But that doesn’t detract from the original point that diversity is beneficial in media 
I mean yeah, people get tunnel vision when they’re trying to present their ideology 
She’s saying men are always talking about women in the movie? 
I mean I never saw frozen 
We take it for granted in Cali 
Well it doesn’t have to save him, but exposing people to diversity, especially Daryl is beneficial because he doesn’t see it in Alabama 
Cuz I mean let’s be real, human beings are designed to be racist 
I think if they see diversity in media, they will come to be more accepting of it I guess 
And to us, we can see through it and it seems forced 
Like in Star Wars 
And needing heavy handed, explicit diversity to come across 
Because I think they perceive their audience as being mainly younger 
Disney can’t separate themselves from seeming forced 
In a way 
Like 
And an anomaly, not many artists can do what he does <e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1574545280547" ts="1574545280" t="61"></e_m>

Yuh, I mean Tarantino is a god 
Like black spider man, he’s just Spider-Man but black 
What they did with Spider-Man was good 
But like 
I mean “forced” integration is okay imo. It’s dumb when their entire character is about how they’re a minority

The Game Boy Advance version has a score of 55 out of 100 from Metacritic based on &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. It was mostly praised for its graphics, which were considered to be above average at the time of its release.
Jimmy decides to build a time machine to impress Cindy. He sets the travel time to 50 years in the past. When Jimmy decides to activate the time machine with him and Goddard inside, they are instead teleported into cages in the lair of Jimmy Negatron. Jimmy Negatron is an evil version of Neutron from another dimension. Negatron plans on taking over Retroville and Jimmy must stop him.
I wonder if anyone is streaming this on twitch ever 
And negatron is just really really upset 
And why is jimbo two

Eric, life happens. You aren’t immune to life, regardless of what you own. I wish nothing bad upon you but  
thinking you’re invulnerable is foolish
Alright, continue being dishonest with yourself. This is why these conversations don’t work 
That’s really funny coming from the person who thinks their parents are absolute 
We’re saying if you like, are unemployed and can’t feed yourself 
&quot; In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone&quot;
We aren’t saying you’re a vegetable Mars 
Would you rather your family die? 
Which I mean, good on you, but that’s an unrealistic worldview 
Your self worth and value is absurd if you think you could never be compromised 
We will see if you take that hard line if you or someone you loved ever found yourself in a position where you or them were unable to “forage” 
so i guess nothing has changed bud
and you still don't value the lives of marginalized people
we still have genocides
life has been valued since civilization began, probably before that too
that's a lie too 
that an observer is needed to quantify value? 
therefore nothing has value since someone must perceive value for it to exist
do things not have value if nothing can perceive it? yes
only if there is an observer to quantify it tho
the value of life cannot be quantified 
this is where i agree with mars
nothing can be valued like that
that's not true
nah im just saying the infinity of possible things is so much larger than the infinity of real things that the fact that your consciousness is here is crazy 
well put 
yuh 
i have a vsauce video you can watch mars
the possible combinations of things that COULD exist VASTLY exceeds the possible combination of things that DO exist
NO eric you fool
IMMA SHower there better be interesting shit to read when i come back 
nohat
but mars is 100% right about what yall are talking about 
and i realize my theoretical philosophical physics isn't what we wanna hear right now 
Considering every possible combination of matter which could exist in the space which you exist now, the fact that you exist there and something else doesn't has such a low probability that you are profoundly unique and as a result, your unique consciousness is meaningful due to its almost  impossibility and rarity 
okay but consider: 
wait that's so incorrect on so many levels lmao
bc i wanted to get into my favorite topic of possible combinations of matter 
but what is mars talking to
wait... im im not arguing for or against egoism 
THATS not even what im talking about
AHH im too stoned to explain this 
like your consciousness in itself is completely unique 
you are very unique correct? 
okay how bout this though
see hold on 
wait wait
consider the numbers
but mars
im saying like, the ability to consciously reflect on reality and our place in it is innately valuable and meaningful in itself 
i mean im not saying that life needs a meaning like &quot;do this and youll be happy&quot; 
but I do agree the meaning is in the absurdity of it all 
if meaning can be derived from it 
wait but doesn't that mean existence has innate meaning 
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT MARS 
you probably jerk off to camus 
get your Kierkegaardian ass out of my face 
Why not me 
LMAO the second one is good 
heres a classic tho
I shoulda clipped
the game just finished 
he is SO bad at malphite
SPOT FUCKING ON
ily
LMAO
yes
enough is enough and ive had it up to here with it im finally going to do what ive said ill do and this time i mean business i will finally
he does some very interesting musical effects
like 
like those beats slap hard 
movie music or some shit 
like larger than life 
but like that track itself was dope af 
because I want a dirty, edgy and fresh kanye
that he is going in this artistic direction 
im kinda sad
how to feel about this track 
im really confused
I mean
Also his girlfriend pegs him 
What matters is dressing like a girl gets sneaky’s dick hard 
I think we’re on the same page  
“There is only sex. Everything is sex. You understand what I'm telling you is a universal truth”- Robert California 
Or because his girlfriend is a domme and he gets off on the humiliation 
Either because he’s a sissy 
He obviously likes cross dressing 
I’m just giving you the facts 
Don’t ask me why 
He is like almost passable as a lesbian just like that 
Don’t tell me sneaky ain’t a trap

the other isnt
one is a choice
the other isnt
and one is okay
those are fundamentally different eric
And balance things 
We need to check power 
I just never want one being to have all the power 
Well we don’t know how the future will continue 
But we don’t need to let it take over humanity 
I’m not saying stop developing it 
They also have penis envy 
Reality is what you perceive baby boy 
Someone hasn’t payed attention to his history classes
Like the masses will literally seize power if necessary 
The rich can suck my limp dick
Fighting wars 
Then we won’t let that happen
They’ll start bashing computers 
If humans think ai will remove their purpose 
Individuals are needed for ai to exist 
I don’t think humanity will kill itself intentionally
Everyone doesn’t wanna be without work
To protect the self interest of the individual 
Wait year there is 
I honestly think humanity will put a pause on automation tho
Also big if
If ai does run its course
I mean imo creative professions will be the only jobs in the long run
But I knew what you meant 
Makes no sense 
That statement 
I prolly need to drink more water is my guess 
And I don’t understand 
My breath smells 
Toothpaste is good
Yuh 
At least I have a scholarship so I won’t have to suck dick for my school 
College gay
Idk chief 
Modeling maybe? LMAO 
Well 
And my most probable career outlook is 
I’m about to have a bachelors in finance 
Somehow 
Like 
Business degrees are the biggest lie I’ve ever seen 
But a terrible way to run education 
Which is a great way to make money 
But our entire education system tried to brainwash people to believe you NEED college or else you’re worthless 
Exactly!! 
The fact that getting a degree has such minimal merit that you need additional experience to prove you are a capable worker is just strange 
To Eric’s point though, the university system is a failure BECAUSE any jerkoff can get a degree 
Interns are basically just employees with no specific role. You do what you’re told and you thank whoever is telling you 
I’m just saying the line between internships and work is blurred as is 
especially in the business field
idk im just salty about internships
and if outside work does not qualify as experience to smc, that's really fucked up, I doubt that's the case
If they are willing to offer interns work, they just just commit to a conditional job offer depending on the quality of work done 
which is why low employee turnover is highly sought after
onboarding costs for any business are HUGE
but its not at all cost effective for companies
I mean you already have a job, why tf do they recommend an internship?
and learn if theyre too retarded to work or not
so lets have a company pay them 
The idea of: oh, heres a student. We don't know if theyre too retarded to work in a professional setting
internships are not an effective practice imo
honestly
I mean internships are useful but a good GPA proves that you're a decent student and can manage yourself and your workload. that is fucked theyre making you wait
BRUH let’s talk about that... why tf is that a thing 
And I need to bleach my butthole but I’m not complaining about it 
Is negative 
That the general response to my beautiful images thus far 
I don’t like 
jk gnight
there will be more

LMAO the sprave
I, Giorno Giovanna, am having an anxiety attack
end of discussion 
hes getting best head
nah Theodore's girl is lowkey thicc af 
oh wait
maybe the question is false to begin with 
i wanna get a facial emotion detection AI to read their faces to determine an answer
als leg?
but theodore could be the answer
idk I want it to be simon 
maybe you are right
he looks like he is moaning like a bitch actually
that's substantially harder for anyone to give head to, regardless of skill 
theodore has the biggest little chipmunk dick 
okay hear me out
simon's eyes are closed too 
That man is deep in his REM cycle I have no clue what you’re referring to 
He’s getting the best 
If Theodore isn’t asleep tho 
I’ve seen that face before 
I think Simon is the safe bet 
That’s quite accurate 
Simon is crying and Theodore is either asleep or having pass out worthy suck 
Me think Simon or Theodore 
Alright which one is getting that good suck 
I feel like our collective reasoning can solve bigger problems than the complexities discussed last night 
Why is your dick legendary 
wait whos 6'7
fighting over semantics doesnt make you smart
LMAO
grindr 
and im disgusted
ive had like 5 people compliment my feet this week 
YO WHY ARE PEOPLE OUT HERE LIKING FEET
this coming from the man who is one digit short of a full set
5643
im WAY too zonked for that
im also not trying to argue about the philosophy of piss play
i mean, it degrades oneself very much in order to satisfy someone else 
no cap 
its altruistic to get pissed on 
cheers to that 
oh i know it 
by reducing it to questions of watersports
im glad i destroyed this discussion 
thats a good ass reason 
in your shower
so you can piss on girls
temperature wise and metaphorically
and hot 
piss is sterile
no one likes shit 
ew
xd
if she wanted it 
but youd piss on a chick
not that someone has to piss on you
no i mean
lets be real everyone likes piss
i like piss
cuz its always gonna splash back fam
dont enter pissing contests
because someone is always gonna have a bigger cock
stop measuring dicks
needing to win everything to be happy
lets like stop
dydx
he is already playing devils advocate dx
Regardless of the amount
The point still stands
when you are talking about owning 6 cars and bs 
you aint gonna call 30k far away 
wait hold on
its still not 700 
okay so 75 adjusted for inflation 
i will link the study
hence norcal is pretty lit sometimes
so i want both
but booty short weather is also nice
see cuddle weather is a godsend
buy an f-150 and shut up if you live in the mountains
like angels
theyre beautiful
and novel
wait the mountains are very cool
they have food 
colorado is so beautiful
two gold stars for that young man 
fuck thats powerful
but they wont love you truly
theyll have your kids
theyll fuck you, theyll marry you 
no one is going to love you for your money
than a mansion by myself
id rather be living in an RV with someone i love
dude having that special someone in your life just dissolves the need for money
thats your opinion 
adjusted for cpi yes
yes
i mean inflation adjusted
totally
that would be sick 
if i owned a house?
very happy with that
yes
id be so happy with 50k a year
you are a very special case
ubuntu
Like come on 
What defines good food 
I am the hooker 
Where I aim 
Is having a joint with someone I care about 
My good shit 
Based on person 
Because definitions change 
Define good 
There’s more to life than work 
Not everyone needs to have kids anyways

OH FUCK THATS SEXY 
There is more to life than having the most

<ss type="puke">(puke)</ss>
ew who would eat a pussy
oh i guess that isnt strictly dicks
alright eric knows alot about giving head 
i really like making someone feel good

Altruism supports others and the individual
just stop caring so much about knocking people up and everyone would be happier
not everything has to be about passing on your genes dude
if you do it in public it doesnt count 
compassion is important
its a human trait
communities of support and care
altruistic behavior is actually beneficial to the most people
money doesn't equal skill
that doesn't make trump skilled though
that's true
he was given that money by birth
id gladly take his unearned billions
i mean you think trump is a skilled person?
Well that’s why I support UBI Mars, so people are more able to do what they enjoy and possibly avoid some of that menial labor 
Plus people need a purpose in life to feel worth 
Objectively, work has many many good attributes and effects 
efficiency good if make happy
happy good
but I mean, again youre just maximizing efficiency 
Ah I understand your hypothesis now 
Who is to say that productivity ought to be maximized in society? If we take into account other more human values, complete automation leads to severe deficits in these values 
Lmao bruh I’m always vibing 
I like face down ass fucked and three for one cock combo

GUYS I HAVE A MEEMEE
thanks for coming to my ted talk 
truly magnificent 
remarkable 
look at the size of his spirit's ass 
 exhibit b
his tiddies have shading lines they are so big 
his pants are literally crotchless, his dong is out
 look at this
but is he thicc? absolutely not
it could easily break every bone in my hand
yes his ass is muscular 
look at this pose
his tiddies are there but underwhelming
no visible bulge 
conservative pants 
look at this
dont believe me? 
I feel like this is a Greek/Roman thing tho. Like yeah, Dio stole the body... but he made it a lot better 
im you guys too
They have no means to rebel 
They aren’t retards 
Of course they do 
They are poor 
China will be overturned 
Even a smidge 
And if the poor get power 
And the poor are pissed 
They are still people 
The MIDDLE class 
Are you fucking kidding 
The majority cannot be middle class 
That’s literally impossible Eric 
So be a slave all you want 
And I’ll never give up my freedom 
Most people in China have no money or power 
Because I’m not my country 
But it doesn’t matter to me if the us falls 
Just like the us will fall 
And some day China will fall
They are brainwashed 
No nation is immortal 
The individual wins every time 
And if they ever got a taste 
They don’t know what freedom is 
Because they are forced to 
China would be done 
If they got the means to mobilize 
The Asian continent literally has over a billion pissed off people 
Because of freedom 
The world is so much more peaceful today 
Let freedom win 
Or 
Yikes 
Make your own game 
No 
Conforming 
Obeying 
Is being the same as them 
Your method of beating them 
I’m glad I’m letting people be free 
Good 
I’d be fighting 
A citizen there 
If I were in Hong Kong 
I mean 
love and individuality matter to me
we disagree on what matters
But for that which matters, never back down 
Not for everything 
I’d die free rather than conform 
Gun to my head? Pull the fucking trigger 
That’s discipline 
I will never back down from who I am 
I have discipline. I have the discipline to be myself <e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1570674469825" ts="1570674469" t="61"></e_m>

It’s why informed consent works 
Success isn’t measured in money 
they never want that to happen to their kid
like, they know what it feels like to be outcasted
my dad knocked up a jew and wasn't disowned
my mom left home early
but my parents would support me in almost anything
maybe it would be unrealistic to have that expectation of YOUR parents
NO ITS NOT
because it is my choice
and if for some reason they didn't? i dont care
because i love them
they would love my spouse
they would be so happy for me
id tell them i love someone
no 
i dont need them to make that choice
i know what i want
i dont go asking my parents what i should have for dinner every night
and i dont think someone who isn't me can make that choice
i dont know if that would have been a good choice
but 
i could have been in my closet my whole life
well 
i am my surroundings<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1570673812857" ts="1570673812" t="61"></e_m>

parents
i am my professors
i am you
theyre only a part of that
every interaction in my life is me 
not everything of me is them
i am me
but i wouldn't let them tell me who i should fuck
i think my parents are incredibly smart
but you aren't them
they know better for themselves
and they support my judgement
i know what is best for me
they dont know what is best for me
so long as im not hurting myself or those around me
they want whatever it is i want
but i love them with all my heart
i dont have to pay for their choice
that was their choice
yes<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1570673603111" ts="1570673603" t="61"></e_m>

my parents gave me everything they did with no expectation of repayment
no 
because i care about everyone here very much
i would give any of yall anything i could 
but i freely give to those that i love
i owe no one 
if the community youre in does not support you as an individual
find a new community
its a fight for yourself
its not a fight for nothing
you are who you surround yourself with
you are not who youre born of
and jett does too 
but i think youre wrong
that's your opinion
when i transitioned
was going to lose my father
because i seriously thought
and my family
chose between my identity 
i literally 
dude
jett isn't gay
but dont make us conform 
youre free to make that choice
that's your choice eric
your happiness is much more important than grandkids
you dont owe them grandkids
 they dont deserve to be in your life
if your sexuality made them cut you off
theyre dogshit people then
why would you cut off your arm
you aren't a man if you let them control you
they have no right to control you
wow that's crazy
because she respects your autonomy as a person?
if you take the attitude that you have nothing to lose except your freedom 
and so he is free
he has nothing to lose
eric she isn't leaving jett with anything in the first place
likewise
is completely toxic
because they know being outcasted by your parents
which is why they support all that i am
exactly, my parents want whats best for me
i dont owe them anything
but just like everyone else
and i love my parents more than anything
its not an ideology its not being a slave
you can do whatever you want right now
you can respect yourself without money
They found that $70k of income produced the maximal level of comfort and happiness 
that's fucking sexy free will right there
making a choice for no reason other than to be yourself
taking shit into your own hands
and that's called being free
but i was willing to tell him to fuck off if that's what it took to be myself
i get money from my dad if he dies
id was ready to give up literally everything for my identity
all that matters to me is my identity and my relationships
of course
that's who i am
and all anyone remembered about me
would be what yall remembered about me
and all that would be left
besides for my car
all my shit would get thrown away
like if i died tomorrow 
not what you have
but the memory left behind will be who you are
and you cant take anything with you
we all will return to the dirt 
its who i am
my place isn't what i have
nope
and honestly i could care less
i do not know Chinese folklore
i dont owe someone anything for a choice i wasn't involved in
that was there choice to have me
nope
it was their choice
nope
you dont owe anyone anything
ooh we are getting to the root of the issue
fuck off and die
and i would have said
they would have said no 
if i asked my parents if i should transition 
not really
thank you jett
now
id be sucking dick for a living right
dude if they were my parents
well, id say fuck your parents
because most parents you know are asian
 parents are the ideal
no they arent
 they still love me
im literally a tranny
my parents will love me regardless of anything
Any additional dollar did not add to happiness 
And at that time 
Infact a study was done a couple years ago 
He’s fat and ugly and in a fake marriage 
I doubt trump is very happy 
In fact, the ultra rich are often depressed 
And their additional wealth doesn’t bring happiness 
But a lot of people have way more than they need or could use 
That’s ideal 
When you can have enough to survive, with a little excess 
That’s why we view the middle class as a goal 
Wealthy t
People can be happy without being wealth 
That’s not happiness if you always need something new to be happy 
If your happiness comes from material goods, you’ll always chase something new tha
Physical happiness is fleeting 
We need enough. All you need to meet you physical needs is enough 
THAT is western culture 
We don’t need nice things to be physically happy 
which makes sense for you
see, you just want everyone to be little computers
its hard for you obviously 
love isn't easy 
you lack emotional discipline 
having a family and friends that i love to death
you know what makes me satisfied?
I don’t know if you’ll ever be happy with that worldview Eric 
Girl, don’t tell me love isn’t important 
Love is the singular strongest emotion 
Literally 
Love produces all power 
They could 
so, if you objectively judge everyone 
and our surroundings (as kids) are out of our control
but you are a result of your surroundings
hes gonna agree
to a fair shot at life
but we all have a right
has a right to succeed
no one 
but most dont
and some do 
totally
and you are privileged to have such a strong mom
but she did instill her work ethic in you
and yet youre off on a better foot than most
you dont have her greatness
but you didn't have to do that to succeed 
that's honestly amazing 
because how do you expect a kid to secure housing and food and affection for themselves
and cant be met
but because their basic needs aren't met 
not because they aren't mentally strong
but situationally, some have a harder time overcoming
we all experience great trials
im lucky i had that too 
its so much harder
but when you dont have your basic, survival level needs secured
im glad you got through your depression
that's all im saying
imagine how much harder someone who is depressed must have it, if they did not have all the basics in their life covered
or were you a hormonal teenager
were you diagnosed with depression?
Clinical depression
Depression 
but you've never been in that situation
youre almost right
see
Wallowing is a symptom
that's your opinion
but it doesn't really matter
last summer
so did i 
have you ever been depressed?
i dont want anyone to feel sol
been there
im soft because i understand what hopelessness feels like
because most would fail
then most would be terribly disappointed with their lives
if everyone wanted to triumph
that's your opinion
regardless of anything
you were promised that
you never had to work for that
and by being born rich
and food on their plate
a roof over their head
some people just want
not everyone wants huge success eric
how about
here are your foodstamps for life
like oops, your parents were poor 
so just fuck over everyone to come after them?
because they are not given the same opportunities as you by birth
dont deny them a chance
but don't punish kids for coming from a poor family
not wholly neutral
so do you deserve an easy ride?
and your parents did better
no its their parents vs yours
i don't deserve shit asshole
no skills
they cant succeed
you just said the poor are born with no skills
nah it wouldn't be possible if youre born with no skills
THIS GUY IS REALLY SPOUTING OFF ARTISTITILIAN IDEALS
AND LIKE EARLY CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY
THATS LITERALLY WHAT THEY THOUGHT IN MEDEIVAL EUROPE
that's some 12h century logic right there
aight
?
so poor people are born destined to be poor
why do they have no drive and talent?
why do they fail eric?
and he still denies a vicious cycle of poverty 
like weve had this discussion atleast 3 times
he doesn't understand why poverty happens
maybe you are a retard afterall 
yet you cannot do it
stop crying when people are suffering from poverty more than you could ever comprehend
all im saying is 
and a very very select top few make it successful
the main story: poor kids without a family to support their education find something else to do
and any differences that do exist biologically only account for a fraction of the story
Black success in sports are not due to biological differences
all statistics
all numbers
its literally
because they have at least 4x as many people
they have at least 4x as many researchers as the US
they should have a lot of research
because there are billions of people in china
that's fucking racist as all hell
Asians are not more skilled than other races
most of Everyone cannot make it to the middle class
most black kids are fucked out of the middle class
of making it to the middle class
are fucked out of any chance
most white people in this country
go ahead, be white
you can afford that
plastic surgery 
change your name
well then dye your skin asshole 
look at the rich boy complaining about getting fucked out of a pay check by white america
that is a gross oversimplication of why Chinese americans are rich 
Everything else is just a symptom 
The root cause: income inequality 
Tackle the root cause, not the result of the problem 
It wasn’t the correct way to solve the problem 
Affirmative action doesn’t work 
Cuz this is bs to listen to 
Sorry I’m just heated 
Jett stop talking about that extreme case 
IF THEY HAD THE TUTORS THEY WOULD 
Such circular fucking logic 
I’ve never seen 
Like parents struggle to provide their kids with lunch 
Do you think intercity kids can afford SAT TUTORING??
That doesn’t help Eric 
But at the same time, I(and I think Jett) are arguing we should level the playing field 
Literally, neither I or Jett have ever argued we aren’t privileged 
you wanna talk about free shit? 
OH BOY 
To reduce human value to intellect is abhorrent 
I completely agree 
And intelligence isn’t the most valuable human trait 
Not really 
Nope 
For things which are not in their control 
We can not punish people 
Which isn’t their fault 
Because they aren’t as privileged
They can’t afford to do what you can 
They can’t afford to study as hard 
They’re “less intelligent” because they are poor
And that leads to being underskilled 
They are poor 
They’re not underskilled 
It’s not fair if some people are at a disadvantage 
When certain races are advantaged or disadvantaged 
Objectivity doesn’t work 
That’s not bullshit 
Because the average for Asians is higher 
Lmao dog shot 
That’s a dog shot hypothesis 
But no employer will pay you 20% less on account of your race 
These cause wage gaps 
Privileged gaps exist 
Educational gaps exist 
Wage gaps don’t exist 
^
20k below Asian 
Look at the median white income 
That doesn’t happen
Yes Asians are more educated! Because they come from wealthier more privileged backgrounds 
Eric is almost there 
Asians have the highest median income 
Uh 
youre right though, Asians represent 3.1% of all film roles while they represent almost 6% of the population
I think America is racist overall 
but ill settle that discussion by saying yang gang
now we could get into the socioeconomic factors regarding why there aren't a proportionate number of ethnic actors 
LETS GO US
we on the same page 
ye
but the marketers wanted a childrens film and black was one of the only comedy actors familiar to children at that time
It would have been HILARIOUS with Iglesias too, maybe as more of an adult film
as an actor 
it was believable and funny regardless of Nacho's race
because Black did a good job 
the film's premise was not dependent on the actor's ethnicity 
but like idk 
and jack did an excellent job
Gabriel Iglesias COULD have been cast
like 
nacho libre
i have an example
OH 
*where
i don't see any concrete examples were minorities weren't cast because only a white actor could play the role
and although some actors have archetypes distinct to their characters
but acting is about ACTING a personality 
i mean that's all good and fair
but oftentimes the pool isn't looked at
well of course
its not like she stole spotlight from a black cosplayer
but if its an independent model or artist doing their own work
white people being casted for ethnic roles is kinda fucked
and like
black face paint to become an undead pirate is not 
like, black face paint and big red lips is offensive 
blackface needs to support racial sterotypes to be blackface 
i mean let use science thinking on this one
wtf is wrong with this world 
wait and then this happened too
fucking mainlanders, amirite eric? 
i kinda wanna provoke them now 
i typed hong kong 2019 democratic protests in a couple games today 
wait Im kinda scared im gonna be banned
yee
did you hear tencent censored worlds broadcasters
LMAO love you dad 
Hong Kong Protests 2019
Hong Kong Protests 2019

And the key to flaming 
8 games till I can flame again 
Just pisses me off when people get defensive in team chat I guess, never a need to escalate the situation 
That’s how I flamed my pyke and then he admitted he was garbage lmao. And then I admitted I was garbage when I fucked up 
I guess it’s the most secret type of flame 
But in the absence of tone passive aggressive just sounds kind 
Like 
I literally was just flaming our Kass because he flames me and our Kayle because she had no presence on the map 
I wasn’t racist 
I like didn’t tell anyone to kill them selves 
I know <ss type="sad">:(</ss> 
i literally wasn't that bad tho

there could be a crunch wrap supreme in you 
BORUTO
BEEFY
gimme that beefy 5 layer burrito
but come on 
the crunch wrap is good
quesarito is god tier
taco bell burritos are the jam
but youre wrong
reminds me of when i had crippling existential dread xd
its not really a selling point for anyone 
i mean idk 
yeah 
short guys with big dicks are kinda funny to me
that's also true 
its noticeable after a certain point
I mean just regardless of if you grow or show
that's better
MILO I’m a dick expert don’t refute me on this matter 😤
Well yeah 
It also very much shows in your pants 
If your dick is over average 
Literally 
Ur smart 
Exactly Milo 
Oh Jett not me 
I’m not retarded I’m horny
Consider the psychological advantage of being able to destroy some coochie(🤮)
Or y’all 
Tall
6’3 too y’all 
It’s something I would have done 
🤔🤔
An inch of height for an inch of dick 
Consider 
Bet
I wish I was part of that gang <ss type="sad">:(</ss> 
Jojo
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
THIS IS SO FUCKING SEXY
there are a lot of trannies on there
Is that a challenge 😤
Talk about my slutty ass some more <at id="8:milo.amoore">Milo</at> 
It’s called grindr baby 
Eric wat 
This is hilarious 
Like pig tails dude 
ALSO just saw a dyke and her bitch that are hearing the EXACT same hairstyle 
So it was just more a damn, my slutty ass really has to face the consequences of my actions <ss type="sad">:(</ss>
Like I fuck a lot of people but I’ve never had like social interactions near people I’ve just fucked around with 
I just think it’s funny 
wait Jett idgaf 
Or if he was just too awkward to acknowledge I knew him dx
I don’t know if he didn’t recognize me cuz I was in a full face 
They were retarded memers yeah he like showed up halfway through 
And I was hitting it off with this other guy and his friend 
Like tonight 
I went to a dorm social 
And he ghosted but it was whatever at the time, his one notable trait was that he talked like Dunkey when he was trying to be funny 
There was this guy that I used to suck off on the regular last quarter 
So 
Okay 
AAHHHHH I JUST HAD A REALLY WEIRD SOCIAL ENCOUNTER 
well I mean, I guess the theory is that the system caused their failure
<b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">plug for yang gang intensifies</b>
which is why I like ubi because we don't need to quantify every act someone does in a day, we can give a set amount to account for everything they do in a certain timespan that isn't work related and doesn't create monetary value on its own  <e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1569977738573" ts="1569977738" t="61"></e_m>

like, its hard to put a monetary value on a smile, but making someone happy does have value from a social and a philosophical perspective
But like, its all a very theoretical framework, bc it is really hard to quantify the value of some things in a market context 
I’m glad y’all seem to agree 🙂
Yeah! And like idk, as a finance major I think I’m in a decent position to say that that system is bullshit 
I really be respecting memes over here 😳😳
I gotta say love or hate 
And for the posterity of that meme 
Format is important 
Oh well 
Who tf would hate David 
Wait 
But David is really spitting facts with that one 
Yo love him or hate him 
C ya

I’m glad milo appreciated my thesis :3
Just because we can’t measure it yet doesn’t mean we never can 
BOOM dude I’m such a cerebral finance major 
We just don’t know how to measure their value 
Besides things that make money
But other things are valuable 
Our economy only knows how to value things that make money
Like 
It reevaluates the value of alternative labor 
No 
Well hold on
Fuckyeah milo 
We could afford giving back 
And if we got assistance from our government 
exactly
try
yty
but not if you work a menial pointless job
work is very important in generating value and happiness
states of mind will
things wont make you happy
like
it should be found
idk, i think happiness shouldn't be chased 
i mean
oh exactly
do something you enjoy 
if you aren't happy, youre fucking something up 
that's how i was raised
i only care about happiness
see
but having a rich family is incredibly helpful
i mean im not saying you were handed everything eric, you worked very hard
exactly
as they are the richest demographic on average<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1569969325644" ts="1569969325" t="61"></e_m>

Well i mean statistically, Asians do better in america
people of color, lgbt peeps, single mothers, mentally ill people, orphans, the sick 
like 
a lot of people have a lot of real problems in this world
but like idk
yikes
he really isnt
d
x
exactly
yes milo
and those 98% would now be viewed as undesirable
then there will still be a bottom 98% of that remaining 2%
so if we kill off 98% of people
okay
id say less than 10%
how many people do we think are willing and able to work 80 hours a week?
can we just say
wait
suicide rates are high for stressful hardworking professions
i mean
i would never lmao
i don't wanna work 80 hours
it isn't racist 
of course 
then go for it
unless you want to
no one should have to work 80 hours a week lm,ao 
college is a privilege
i mean 
most people don't have the opportunity to study that hard
but like
i mean most of us are just chilling
not really tho 
say it milo
yikes
because I GO TO CLASS WITH THESE PEOPLE
but also scary
its basically porn for me
i have 
i know its counterintuitive
im a business major we talk about this all the time
it aint stupid
thus general society
i mean it is in the best interest of businesses to help their stakeholders 
like ya gotta understand your privileges
you know?
but I mean, we get a lot of free shit for existing
yell on call so I can be aroused
but if you do
don't beef guys
nah that's normal
wait who did you roast
ill observe him more
I have a class with some of my suspected psychopaths today
IDK DUDE
I KNWO BUT THAT IS LIKE SHOWING EMOTION
dx
lmao
sorry that sounded like an insult
i know but  you are interesting eric<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1569968245667" ts="1569968245" t="61"></e_m>
i know but  you are interesting eric<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1569968245667" ts="1569968245" t="61"></e_m>
and you don't come off as a complete douchebag
and why do you speak like you hate everyone's guts
what are you hiding
so its just weird when people like act so plain
like im a tranny stoner, i wear that on my sleeve, im not hiding anything
you know?
and i feel like their attempts at normality create more abnormality underneath
but its often very cold
they have to be perfectly normal on the outside
like 
no they care too much about self image
like business majors
idk some emotional something is missing for these people
idk just the way they talk in public 
i feel like there is something hiding in there
and when I look at them
just like, very rich, very plain handsome white guys who are VERY VERY stuckup and think extremely highly of themselves
I think a lot of them are here
there are many people at my school who have the personality profile of Jason Bateman and it kinda scares me
ive realized
because
did you read th book?
The one with Christian Bale
you guys know the movie American Psycho?
im kinda cerebral when it comes to blaming tencent for shit
that's because tencent supports pedofucks, Chinese dude<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1569967056917" ts="1569967056" t="61"></e_m>

Since before this was the &quot;Elevator Going Up&quot; interlude, does that make this the elevator music? Or have we already left the elevator? Or is the position of the elevator to us irrelevant?- Random out of context youtube comment
I would recommend league to nobody
man 
also sadistic 
than plat solo queue
anything sounds more fun

dota 2 is to be recommended

Cartoons in realistic settings 
I just hate 
Mayb
Code veins art style hurts tho
Like we play shit very differently, but we are still ok at league 
I never really realized we are different types of gamers 
You know that’s really interesting 
Outplayed.
Because I understand the animation 
So threshes can never hit me 
I was a really good thresh at a time
Like 
No no it’s out mentaling 
By respecting their animations 
Well you can outplay them 
But ai make very predictable autistic actions 
With like random autistic actions 
You are too used to playing against people 
I think you haven’t learned how to learn ai mechanics 
Genichiro isn’t hard 
Okay but 
Anyways what have we learned today? Milo is still a bitch, I’m retarded and without a man, and code vein is the dark souls of vampires 
You make me want to cry. That’s (in my opinion) kind of cruel. But even so, I do respect YOUR opinion.
I wish Conner would be my boyfriend <ss type="sad">:(</ss>
You’re being a bitch 
Back to case one
Exactly 
The frames are very fair in souls 
Just because it doesn’t have adderall attacks like in smash bruh   
At any point in your rotation you can start an attack animation 
You’re never locked out of an attack with movement in dark souls. 
NOT EVEM THE SAME 
It’s just animation tho 
How can you be so rude to Miyazaki 
I want to beat you up &gt;<ss type="sad">:(</ss>
ds3 has no input lag 
THEY ARENT EVEN THE SAME 
Nah you’ll never beat them 
And understand they can only work within their rules 
You have to accept how things work 
You just tried to fight the engine 
No Milo 
You make me want to cry. That’s (in my opinion) kind of cruel. But even so, I do respect YOUR opinion.
X FUCKING D BITCH

No emojis can destroy the spirit of man more than these two 
🔍🤔
🥵
I believe 
A tissue 
🤧
Dx
And yes 
(That’s what she said) 
It’s hard dude 
But also surprise 
There’s the emotion boom 
It’s basically embarrassment+arousal 
It’s like 😮+☺️+🥺
You know what I mean 
Whenever you call me a bitch 
It’s basically 
I make that face a lot 
I really like this one 😳
Yo he really playing pubg over here 
Wtf that game is dead, why he playin it 😂
Imma be real tho, he is about to get that dubski 👀 he ain’t playing around 
lmao wtf is that bug doing 😂😂
I mean, he is kinda vibin tho 😳
Still, can someone tell me what he’s doing 
Sexy 
still am <ss type="cool">(cool)</ss>
Quite the chonk lord if I do say so 
I was 10 pounds as well 
Oh also I didn’t read the tale of your birth 
He’s a kitten cuz furry 
Except parsa 
My personal opinion 
Well 
Daddy: Jett, Miles, Eric, Mars, and David 
Kitten: Milo, Parsa, and Digbo 
I’m going to tell you what gender you are 
Actually 
What gender are you guys 
That really says something doesn’t it 
I mean 
Wait this nigga really over here aging 👀👀
I mean imma be a real with you, he still lookin kinda fresh tho 😳💯
Lmao I knew it was the 23rd, thought I was worst girl for a second 
High five my guy 
Yet here we are 
Eric and I never agree on anything 
🤷🏻‍♀️
Some people aren’t so defensive of themselves 
No matter how much bigger someone is than me, I’m going to talk shit and get physical if I need to, but I know I’ll prolly just get fucked up 
I mean look 
He coulda been a twink type 
I mean 
Physical contact I mean 
That was after the guy he did it to said he didn’t want contact 
But like 
He also said he loved him like no one else 
That’s not the dumbest thing I’ve ever said 
I mean he is bi 
But I mean, if he does rape someone, spiro will fix that 🤷🏻‍♀️
What if that’s his plan 
I vote for chemical castration 
But seriously fuck him

We are truly an underrepresented minority in this developing world, and it’s difficult for people to understand the struggles of being a rapist in today’s day and age.”
You can’t xd
All frat boys are trash, change my mind 
Rapists deserve no pity 
Like Cnc is a legitimate kink, rape is just fucked 
He texted that to the girl 
In the article? 
That quote pisses me off tbh 
Consent is kinda important bro

DUDE 
HOLY 
The split screen is dope tho
No online multiplayer

Is it ever relevant with qt? 
I mean 
his conclusion is that female makeup artists exist?
and then that autism struck 
and then he was like, well, mayb they don't idenfity as male 
and whats up with male makeup artists? are there no female ones
and then he was like idk why insta thinks I like makeup
He was talking about how his Instagram feed is filled with male makeup artists
i love him so much
QT tries to understand something he cannot
It was kinda shitty

i mean some guys get it
but a guy fumbling with a belt or something isn't 
so like, the concept is hot
bondage is just excessive
the thing is
see most of the time
but like attention makes it worth it
worse
even 
LMAO i use grindr for that
… maybe that's why all my relationships suck
i mean all my relationships come from one night stands
I feel like they just cheat
like, is that sex fulfilling?
idk get a different girl then 
IDK I just don't get it
or being choked like a bitch
who tf doesn't like choking a bitch 
idk I hate that shit
idk vanilla is like\
respectable I guess

Vro...
@parsa at least you know what gender is, im the real retard here
;))
but idk when
sometime in the future he will open this
i feel like im leaving a time capsule milo
Parsa im calling you autistic not as an insult but as a term of enderement, which is probably worse for you 
but he might read this later
well he isnt here right now
because some of us are autistic and need everything to be laid out explicitly
you questioned it

Kuro's Charm (The Path of Further Hardships)
Kuro's Charm and the option to give it away to increase the game's difficulty becomes unlocked as soon as the player has completed the main story and entered New Game Plus at least once. 

After completing the main story, upon starting a New Game or a New Game+, you will receive Kuro's Charm automatically at the start of the game. When you speak to Kuro in the tower and retrieve your sword, you have the option of returning it to him. Parting with the charm will give you a permanent 'difficulty' debuff, similar to ringing the Demon Bell. This debuff makes you receive chip damage when blocking attacks, effectively changing your play style. The Sculptor provides a dialogue option to remove this additional hardship if players later change their mind; however, you cannot give the Charm back (and regain the difficulty debuff) until the next run. As a minor benefit for taking on this extra challenge, giving away the charm also increases Exp and Sen rewards from killing enemies by 20% (rounded up). 

Note: when selecting &quot;load game&quot; from the main menu any save files where Kuro's Charm has been given away will have an icon to indicate this.   
Actually no he is too easy

The bubble blowing stando 
Kujo Jotaro is a normal, popular Japanese high-schooler, until he thinks that he is possesed by a spirit, and locks himself in prison. After seeing his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, and fighting Joseph’s friend Muhammad Abdul, Jotaro learns that the “Spirit” is actually Star Platinum, his Stand, or fighting energy given a semi-solid form. Later, his mother gains a Stand, and becomes sick. Jotaro learns that it is because the vampire Dio Brando has been revived 100 years after his defeat to Jonathan Joestar, Jotaro’s great-great-grandfather. Jotaro decides to join Joseph and Abdul in a trip to Egypt to defeat Dio once and for all.

The legendary player imaqtpie first realized that in order to climb, you must be willing to allow yourself to be vulnerable&quot;
is his name Joe?
Born into the tribe, Unka Uuk, Unka Unk learned to fight before he could even walk. Although the Uuk people have a history of extremely low intelligence, Unka Unk suffered an almost fatal head injury at the age of five. After a night of raids, the men of the village came home to find the young Unka alone, throwing rocks at the tribe's sheep. The tribe leaders, drunk from the blood of their enemies and the wine of the defeated, did not take kindly to Unka's actions. They brutally beat the young boy and sought to give him a permanent reminder of his actions. The tribe leader heated his Warhammer in a roaring fire and dealt one blow to Unka's face. His flesh burned and his head caved, but fortunately or not, he lived. This blow halted his mental development and left his head and face terribly misshapen. The crippled do not last long in the Uuk tribe, but fortunately, Unk's unheard of strength dissuaded any attempts on his life. As Uuk aged, he became renowned as both the dumbest and one of the strongest men in all the tribes. To prove his dominance to his people, he left on a hunt one cold summer night, covered in war paint made of the blood of virgins. When he came back, in his hands he held a Rhinoceros' severed head. The armorers of the tribe promptly extracted the horn and created a fearsome helmet, which both obscured Unka's godforsaken face and gave him a way to finally use his head in battle. Unka immediately put the helmet to use and baptized the horn in the blood of the man who so terribly changed Unka's life. With one fierce headbutt, Unka drove his horn straight through the tribal leader's skull. The tribe did not take kindly to this act and promptly exiled Unka Unk. Now Unka rambles on, killing anything his instincts demand.

Good thing daddy rich 😩
Lmao love when that internship is starting salary for me xD
big gay
but other than that
hopefully my internship here works out
Dx
imagine working xD
and that's gonna bite back
but money has an artificially low cost of capital right now
I mean its not going to be as bad as 2008
idk
or low production 
well they can be
cars are dogshit investments absolutely
depreciation on cars has nothing to do with economic health of the country
Especially new cars 
Wut 
Cars don’t crash in value with the market
Interest rates are low so if you have steady income, now is a great time to buy a car 
Cars arent the same as real estate 
I mean not really 
That’s because lenders think 90 month auto loans is a good idea 
But I already do xd
Exactly 
The market is crashing in max 2 years 
At all 
I wouldn’t buy real estate right now 
Need money to make money xd
I don’t trust anyone in my generation to be a doctor 
And as we know, everything is traceable 
Also, from an opportunity cost perspective, if you get caught with your name on this site you’ll never work again 
So you don’t get a tax benefit doing that 
I don’t think gofundme is a charitable donation 
Also 
Well the reason why the go fund me only had 80k could be because they weren’t advertising and approaching people 
It’s not passive income, this would take work 
It’s not a zero-effort business though. You actually have to put in work to vet charities and engage in analytics to correctly advertise 
Also, people are already doing this 
Nothing stops us from doing that <at id="8:live:eric_3116">Eric</at> 
Long term liability when we don’t even know if the financials behind this are feasible 
And that’s shitty 
This is what I do 
I’m a business student 
While this plan could just fail 
So you want to be locked into a 2400 dollar contract? 
Which takes capital 
I mean not really, but you do need a physical place to call the business 
That doesn’t avoid Cali laws they can still sue you as residents 
That’s the worst idea 
Don’t found it in Kentucky 
Like white supremacists and flat earthers 
He just means retarded shit 
He doesn’t mean illegal shit 
Well there could be liabilities involved 
I mean if it’s capped it’s capped but 
What do you mean? Donation sites take way more than 10%
A decent idea 
That’s actually 
<ss type="smile">:)</ss>
Y’all wouldn’t get paid till I did 
If I funded any venture 
I mean 
That’s kinda what I’m learning to do in school
Well
Or just fund it ourselves xd
I n v e s t o r s 
If we get other people’s money 
So
Is to have money 
An easy way to make money 
So 
If we want to reap tax benefits 
xD
Also needs to be legal 
Well 
So you want to sell drugs? 
Or make a unique service to offer 
I mean product or service. We wouldn’t manufacture anything so we could resell something and add value via our position in the supply chain 
Uh 
What can idiots like us do

yes
I'm still trapped in your cage
I'm still bound to my chains
Is the world stopping dead in its tracks?
Let me show you how to break out
Precious souls are fading to metals
In a way, you have never seen before
Inside a chaos of gray
Trials await
Search for your crimson, it will be your guide
Feeling all that you feel
Knowing just who you are
You'll see a new world and we'll make it last
Fighting gold!
Deep in my memory vault
Trying some appraisals
Stardust in the sky
My soul shines
Our light can never be phased
From under a new wreckage
Fly higher down the coast
A force of nature can find our ruler
Fighting Gold
Tell me, are you really free?
Tell me, am I really free?
Is the world frozen right in its tracks?
Let me show you how to keep your crown
Crushed souls fading to metals
In a way, you have never seen before
Between the sky and the sea
Blue as can be
Search for your crimson, it will be your guide
Being just who you are
Knowing just what you are
You'll see a new world and we'll make it last
Fighting gold!
Deep in my valuing age
Guess I couldn't hide the passion
Let's just spend some time
My soul shines
Our light, a fiery resolve
As promising my body
Fly higher down the course
A force of nature can find our ruler
Fighting gold!
So sharp too late
Keeps falling down on me
Fighting gold!
Deep in my rivalry bout
I'm trying something right, I spray some
Stardust in the sky
My soul shines
A light that never will fade
From under a new wreckage
Fly higher down the coast
A force of nature laughing only now
Fighting gold
fighting gold

xDD
like that was so wholesome and cute
or like looking high in front of parents
having to worry about smelling like weed
you know what i miss?
t e a t i m e

.
honestly sounds lit
i mean im just trynna pass a peace pipe and drink sake with the boys
this is true
but that turns this into an investment 
that would be ideal
or whatever makes it lit 
we gon be burning sage my guy 
 ikr, appropriating from the Japanese in a non-weeby way
no kys
dude of course
instead of popping open a cold one, you want to be cultured and refined?
oh? you want to sip some hot tea with us
from the good good
cuz the heat hides flavor 
cold if its good
hot if its shitty
depends whether its high quality
id get some shit like this
nah fuck that
yeah, like either bowls or clay shotglasses
because earthenware is best cup
so its better tequila 
and we get to drink it out of pottery
 Hey Michael it's me Joey from high school! I remember when we were best buds and used go on the playground after school and light up. Good times man! That reminds me, remember twitchcon when you were rolling up with the riot employees telling them how shit their company was. Good times man, continue to duo abuse with Ship so the balancing team will nerf duoing next instead of Zoe.
alright its settled

but yeah its a tough one
I just cheesed him with firecrackers
just parry him 
lmao 
lmao that nigga took an elbow to the forehead as a baby
Faith is just another worthless sign
I will live my life as godless soul Gangster


My fear is gone, it is all gone
Only a rage is left in my faithless world since I had betrayed my god


All is gone
No revenge
This fate is mine
I will survive on my own
This is my way
Stay Gold


Oh yes, it’s eye for an eye
For the betrayer and thief
Requiem wow wow


Fight with me, there’s no hope but try
Won’t give up, it’s my destiny
Don’t care
Don’t you ever give me mercy
When my life is gone with the wind
Will a prayer vanish into dust
Hell no
Starting over, Golden Wind


Nothing more to lose, there’s no more
Firing soul burned every road to past, days have gone by so fast


Don’t let your soul drawn into the
power of repose
Stand up and incite yourself make your own story


Oh yes, show some pride
For the betrayer and thief
Requiem wow wow


Fight with me, with those raging fists
Let your soul burn into screaming vain
Don’t care
I’m on my way to the truth
So, will I fight for some prize and fame？
Do I need to cast another spell？
Hell No
It all begins with Golden Wind


Fight with me, there’s no hope but try
Won’t give up, it’s my destiny
Don’t care
Don’t you ever give me mercy
When my life is gone with the wind
Will a prayer vanish into dust？
Hell no
Starting over, Golden Wind


makes it ez
i mean the fact that you can take out half of most bosses health bars befiore the fight starts
and thus easier
idk id say sekiro is cheesier than souls

sleep with love 
ty vro
gj
damn
but like 
i wish they didn't m,ake me nervous
they've been chill to me mostly
cuz like
i was sympathetic towards them
it pisses me off that I dislike cops now
but yea
But he was a 30 year old Mexican guy 
I’d say he places it 
He should play league instead of flaming people irl
Fuck that guy tho 
But yes 
I just dump the clutch and look like an idiot 
I mean 
To flex on anyone who sees 
I always do it 
Xd
Cuz I would have gotten a reckless driving ticket 
So I guess it’s a w for me 
He didn’t hear me burnout outta my driveway 
But 
Idk it made me angry 
Ikr 
Yeah
And he knew that 
Cuz I didn’t do anything wrong 
No 
So fuck that guy for making me hate the police 
And now my opinion of police officers is permanently negatively impacted 
And then he drove away 
And I said ok 
Well I could give you a ticket 
And then he was like 
No, and proceeded to explain to him why I pulled up 
And I was like 
But then you saw me 
You were going to run the stop sign 
And says 
And motions for me to roll down my window 
And makes a left and pulls up next to me
And he is driving perpendicular to me 
To see around the cars 
So I pulled up past the white line 
Anyways 
But cars always park near my t 
And the other sides of it don’t have a stop sign 
And there’s a stop sign by my house 
I was driving to jack 
Why do cops gotta be assholes 
Thank u 
this .44 bout to go off
alright nigga
oh?
because the songs which capture them best aren't their best works
hm, maybe they don't have a best song
but stand alone, idk if demon days packs it for me 
the story of fcomh to don't get lost in heaven to demon days is a good progression
i mean
but I think it is their signature work 
it isn't my favorite necessarily
just cuz it captures them the best
Feel Nice Company
probably 
realistically 
but there is a correct answer

well yeah, hey baby is a much better line
but in the english dub, he says &quot;hey bambino&quot;
like in that one scene, Zepelli says &quot;hey Baby&quot; to dio in the japanese dub
why do italian characters in jojos speak italian phrases in the english dub, but in the japanese verson, they speak english phrases
can someone riddle me something
also
Well I just bombed a final xD

@ga gamba

Ga, that’s the weakest thing you’ve ever posted. Yeah working people buy cars, but not Lamborghinis. Yeah, there will be a rush to avoid the tax, but that’s a one time blip isn’t it?

Sometimes I wonder if a single, master tax could cover the whole thing: energy. The rich consume much, the poor consume little. Just tax the hell out of energy and abolish all other taxes. Yes, that will hit my ’81 Chevy pickup hard but overall I consume very little energy as opposed to the zillionarire with his corporate jet and heated pool. Just an idea.&quot;
and some people are actually retarded
I'm reading the comment section on a political article

Everybody saying how, how you do it, you did it

Make the smoker illegal, make the living illegal
Make the laughing illegal, make it snap for a people
When you make a movie now, know you making no difference
It's a tickle on the mind 'fore me finish the sentence
So go pimp a like on Vine, but don't pay for the privilege
Now you broke in Korea Town, in the condo you rented
Better get your percentage
Oh you broke in Korea town in that condo you rented

See? If we look at art not only as what is there, but also what it means, we see a whole new depth of value
Yeah, its just in general, as a consumer of media, we should give the creator the benefit of the doubt
but it isnt that bad
i mean i appreciate that meme parsa
but cool shit happens when those two punch
nah i mean they all punch things
its just shining diamond and gold experience have cooler powers

but thank you for that
i really would rather not be tarred and feathered by dualtwin

and we are gonna be too weak and slow to get away
Nah, youll just be in my dream tonight 
i woulda loved to destroy a crowd of 10 year olds
ikr 
but I hate that shit
maybe submerged in like tar or honey or some shit
I mean 
in dreams it feels like im punching underwater
I prolly died
and that's all I remember
and then this like big ass baby came into the stall and cornered me
so I started to try and fight my way out but I had soft punch on because I can never fight in my dreams
and they were like, we are gonna make you pay 
so I took my shit and when I opened the stall door there were like 20 10 year olds standing outside the stall
and then he reeeed and ran away
and I was like fuck you kid so I threw the water at him
and then like a 10 year old came into the bathroom and looked over the stall and was all like wtf are you doing with that soap
to I took the bottle of handsoap and a cup of water into the stall with me
so I went to the bathroom but thought I really didn't want a dirty ass afterwards 
and I had to take a shit
okay I was at an elementary school for some reason
I had a weird ass dream 
I like that

what are you doing on this day of love 
hbu mars
That's the correct opinion
but I think any man should subscribe to that
I aint saying im not gay 
That is also correct
I subscribe to #3
3: All goth girls have daddy issues so you should  fuck them
2: Not all goth girls have daddy issues so you should fuck them
1: All goth girls have daddy issues so you shouldn't fuck them
Mars there are three schools of thought that govern the world 
or the type of women I go after
Which either says something about women in general
Honestly, I don't think I have been with someone that isn't either very masochistic or has some daddy issues

ooh thats smart
looking at
maybe the art style isnt conducive to like
apex?
actually turning rendering down made it look better
especially on far rendered things
its just all the textures looked so fuzzy it hurt my eyes to look at
it was playable before fps wise
and then adaptive supersampling
and i turned v-sync to adaptive
but yeah all i did was disable all the volumetric lighting bs and shadow rendering
honestly those are fucking fun
yeah i have 8 gb of ram ram

8GB

My third favorite Passione waifu?
NARANCIA
is that
I'm still trapped in your cage
I'm still bound to my chains
Is the world stopping dead in its tracks?
Let me show you how to break out
Precious souls are fading to metals
In a way, you have never seen before
Inside a chaos of gray
Trials await
Search for your crimson, it will be your guide
Feeling all that you feel
Knowing just who you are
You'll see a new world and we'll make it last
Fighting gold!
Deep in my memory vault
Trying some appraisals
Stardust in the sky
My soul shines
Our light can never be phased
From under a new wreckage
Fly higher down the coast
A force of nature can find our ruler
Fighting Gold
Tell me, are you really free?
Tell me, am I really free?
Is the world frozen right in its tracks?
Let me show you how to keep your crown
Crushed souls fading to metals
In a way, you have never seen before
Between the sky and the sea
Blue as can be
Search for your crimson, it will be your guide
Being just who you are
Knowing just what you are
You'll see a new world and we'll make it last
Fighting gold!
Deep in my valuing age
Guess I couldn't hide the passion
Let's just spend some time
My soul shines
Our light, a fiery resolve
As promising my body
Fly higher down the course
A force of nature can find our ruler
Fighting gold!
So sharp too late
Keeps falling down on me
Fighting gold!
Deep in my rivalry bout
I'm trying something right, I spray some
Stardust in the sky
My soul shines
A light that never will fade
From under a new wreckage
Fly higher down the coast
A force of nature laughing only now
Fighting gold

happy Monday my pancakes
Take 2 for my post of the day, this time it's hopefully anime-related enough.

For all of you that don't know, a trap is essentially an extremely feminine male. Feminine to the point where they &quot;trap&quot; the viewer by getting them aroused by something they thought to be male. Now, this has been a point of contention among people before. Technically they are in fact male, but many argue that it isn't gay, regardless of that fact. I'm going to explain the reasoning behind the &quot;not gay&quot; camp.

The first thing to explain is probably what I see as the appeal of traps. I can't speak for anyone because I don't get hard the same way as anyone else, but I think I can guess it with fair accuracy.

The appeal of traps is the fact that they are so feminine, without actually being female. The feeling of the Bait-N-Switch it presents is a good one, the idea that a male is cuter than any girl is both extremely erotic and very, very adorable. It's not the fact that they're male and feminine, it's the fact that they aren't what they seem. It's the same reason many people like tomboys.

A slightly deeper meaning is that traps serve as this ideal that you aren't bound by gender roles or what people might think one should act like. Traps show that people can come in any attitude or personality and still give people a raging erection and drop panties.

The main point is that people who like traps, as far as I can tell, aren't attracted to the fact they are male, but the fact they are a literal trap. Because it's not the &quot;maleness&quot; that attracts them, it isn't gay. I think the best example of this &quot;genderless&quot; attribute would be the iconic Hideyoshi, who is even referred to in-universe as some mystical third gender. This same idea carries over to many other traps, including the infamous reverse-trap, AKA the &quot;You thought I was a guy acting like a girl, but really I was a girl acting like a guy acting like a girl.&quot;

Furthermore, traps fit into that sexual gray area that futanari also goes in. They don't really belong to either gender because of their extraordinarily feminine appearance and the fact they have a dick. You can't call liking traps straight, because they're definitely not female, but you can't call it gay because they're really not all that male either.

To close it out, I understand the people who think it's gay. It's a reasonable stand-point. However, as someone who likes traps but firmly hates non-trap dicks, I have to disagree.

 but from their website, it seems like they are trying to build a portfolio with a business model that gives users access to games for free for trial periods
I don't even know what titles they offer on EG store
and idk if younger gamers have that connection
Like we've been on steam to close to a decade
I mean, I think steam is the superior platform but I am not sure if it appeals to younger users 
Maybe Epic is trying to gain an older playerbase
IDK it seems like a semi smart move. Fortnite has 78.3 monthly users compared to steam's 90 million monthly users. What doesnt make sense is why you would market a mature game on a platform which has mostly underaged users 
Joe is the Duke of Dolphins. Jordan is the Lord of Lobsters. Bensl is the King of Jews
Oh btw shaggy memes are dead and stupid 
Dolphins, like, moves closer to the mic the crazy thing about dolphins is they actually have cough different accents if they're from different places. Wow sip. Jamie pull up that video of boogie1488 curb stomping that black guy.

Holy shit look at the size of the legs on that thing.
ever wonder why they never take off their headdress?
I think muslims have crap waves

if you dont know how to distinguish right from wrong
So, if youre lost
as a young male you are suseptible to aligning yourself towards ideologies without realizing the implications of those ideologies
why dont you clean your room before you diss the foo fighters

Believed to reside in the painting, he acted as some parental figure to The Painter, who calls him her uncle. It is believed that he departed the painting after she was locked away, taking the rotted remains of the physical portal with him, attempting to find another Ashen One to complete the prophecy that would burn away the rotted world so that the Painter could replace it.

Unable to find one, he travels to the Cathedral of the Deep, praying for divine aid in his mission. When he encounters the Champion, he is overjoyed to have completed his search, and requests the Ashen One to free The Painter and show her the flame that would burn the rot. Once they come into contact with the piece of the painting, the Ashen One is pulled into the painted world.

In the fight with Ariandel and Friede, the flame is reignited, and The Painter comments that she will wait until she can see it before beginning the painting. To do that, she needs the pigment she intends to use, which she reveals to be the Dark Soul itself, discovered by the Furtive Pygmy and used to create all of humankind[2]. She also mentions that Gael intended to get it for her, for he has set out on a new mission to find it, and she wonders whether or not he has found it already.

Gael's mission to find the Dark Soul leads him to the Ringed City where he finally meets the Pygmy Lords whose blood would apparently serve as a suitable pigment. However to his shock, their blood has dried out over the ages and is therefore useless to him. Driven mad by this revelation and determined to complete his mission, Gael slaughters the Pygmies, cutting their throats and drinking their dried blood, in a desperate attempt to take the Dark Soul for himself. But even he realized that the Dark Soul was too powerful for him to handle, and it mutated his body, causing him to grow in size and warp his mind.

When the Ashen One finally reunites with Gael, he has been fully corrupted by the Dark Soul and demands their portion of it, attacking them in a rage when they refuse. He is finally struck down, allowing the Ashen One to obtain his blood to use as a pigment.

Tie a dream
To the will of heavy destiny (Sadame)
It's almost crushed
I can not escape anywhere
While scratching all the while
But I will not give it up
On the bottom of rubble
Buried
Hope pieces
Surely with this hand
To find out
To change the world
Fighting Gold
Inside of myself
Only something you believe will someday shine
As long as life
It also resists God
Continue fighting
You are indomitable souls.
Fighting Gold
Just rather than pray
What is required
Mind to move forward
While crawling on the ground
That looked up
Capture the stars in the sky
To the future no one knows
With unwavering bonds
Full of scratches
Responsibility is also
Hold your hand and walk away
Fighting Gold
Release light
Fill all
With the color of passion
Both anger and sin
If it turns into force
I survive now.
With our justice
Fighting Gold
In peace
Turn your back
Fighting Gold
Inside of myself
Only what I believed
Sometime shine
As long as life
It also resists God
Continue fighting
You are indomitable souls.
Fighting Gold
夢を縛り付ける
重たい運命（さだめ）の意志に
まるで押し潰されて
何処にも逃げられない
ひたすら足掻きながら
だけど諦めない
瓦礫の底に
埋もれた
希望のカケラたち
きっとこの手で
見つけ出すさ
世界を変えるために
Fighting Gold
自分の内を
信じたものだけが いつか輝ける
命の限り
神にも逆らい
戦い続ける
不屈の魂たちよ
Fighting Gold
祈るよりもただ
求められるのは
前へと進む心
地べたを這いながら
見上げたあの
空の 星を捕まえるんだ
誰も知らない未来へ
揺るぎない絆と
傷だらけの
覚悟もまた
抱き締めて歩き出せ
Fighting Gold
光を放て
全てを塗りつぶせ
情熱の色で
怒りも罪も
力に変えたなら
今を生き抜くのさ
俺達なりの正義で
Fighting Gold
安らぎに
背中を向けて
Fighting Gold
自分の内を
信じたものだけが
いつか輝ける
命の限り
神にも逆らい
戦い続ける
不屈の魂たちよ
Fighting Gold
Even worse.

with my undying ult
by constantly clearing top jungle 
yea u can pull her from the turret
and not be punished by cd
i mean now you can just summon her for pressure in lane
there is nothing more yorick players want
if she permanently exists and follows
wait i am so okay with that
It’s a buff to low mmr Yorick players but a gameplay adjustment to higher skilled players 
I guess the 6 Yorick mains in NA agree with me
Oh 
It just changes how I need to play 
But now she basically suicides after 60 seconds regardless of whether or not I pull her away 
Because before, after taking top turret I could pull her to Krugs and recall with her and then roam bot and fight for dragon with her or take herald 
Where she unlatches after 60seconds
I mean the 60second thing
No no
It’s almost a nerf 
Actually 
Oh wait
But now it won’t be an issue 
I mean I could already solo it at 30
Yah basically 
Although it’s gonna suck to actually see Yorick have a ban rate 
I don’t think they’ll catch it
I got gold off of banner cancer 
I mean
IM FUCKING DIAMOND NOW
E FUCK 
THEY FIXED MY ONLY COMPLAINT

For all who would pursue
A way to rise above

All the heavens in the night

Fuck these finals were shit 
It means someone who isn’t a Joestar Dx
Nostar is a term I just invented 
Wait but by that logic, Jotaro and Josuke are “Nostars” as well 
You guys like mo bamba? 
thank u father
Guys this is my doctoral thesis 
Joseph isn't a true Joestar: A Proof 
Jonathan solved his problems by punching things.
Jotaro solves his problems by punching things with a ghost .
Josuke also punches things, just slowly.
Therefore: In order to be a Joestar one must punch things to solve problems. 
Joseph runs from things
Running is not punching 
Therefore Joseph is not a Joestar, he is a speedwagon.

not value 
so unless the quick cash, which youll get about 60% of is worth all that 
and the monthly income from rent
and you lose the opportunity cost of the income increasing in value
or apartment whatever
if you sell the house you lose half the profit to taxes

you obviously know nothing about finance if you think selling a passive income property is a good idea

I’m not back enough to give a kid a made up name

I've searched for thee, whore-stricken creature.
I am Bensl, son of David, descendant of gods, and trusted friend to Big Nigga.
At once, I am the honour of the boys, the glory of men, and the fear of the thots.
Thou shalt not go unpunished.
For thy thottery, thy profanity, and thy shameless exposure! Remember this, creature.
Ne'er will I forgive thy kind.
Try again, to remember.
The great honour it was to be a queen.
...Ahh, but why.

Art thou to bed with many men?
Never would I ever...
...forgive thy lowly kind.

But of course 
Perhaps you've seen it, maybe while blazing.
A dank, forgotten land.
A place where memes may mend your ailing mind.
You will lose everything...
... once Retarded
The symbol of the autistic.
An augur of darkness.
Your past. Your future. Your very light.
None will have meaning, and you won't even ask if this is loss.
By then, you'll be something other than human.
A thing that feeds on McDonalds.
A Cuck.
Long ago, in a walled off chat, far to the downs, a great fiend built a great society.
I believe they called it [B]onfire.
Perhaps you're familiar.
No, how could you be.
But one day, you will jerk off before its decrepit text.
Without really knowing why...
Like a Philip drawn to a edibles.
Your mind will burn in anguish.
Time after time.
For that is your fate.
The fate of the gaming ninja.

SoulAsasin Jr. ..The part where Maher sounds like a dumbass is the part where he starts talking, he doesn't say one true thing, his personal hatred for Trump completely blinds him of truth and reality when it comes to Trump. As far as Hillary goes the reason the American people keep saying lock her up Is because she is a criminal of the highest level, she sold 20 % of our weapons grade uranium to the Russians and in return for such a sale is that the Clinton foundation received 150 millions dollars. That should be enough to scare the shit out of even the stupidest people in this country. Treason is a serious crime and the Clintons committed it. Wake up!!!﻿

Acute Cloudd well for starters he was a child prodigy , how many do you know? He was the youngest nationally syndicated columnist in the country, how many do you know? Whet to UCLA at the age of 16, how many do you know? And graduated from Harvard law at the age of 18 or 19,how many do you know? And this is all before the age of 21. Even Bill would agree he's a genius. So you're making yourself look extremely ignorant by saying that.﻿

SoulAsasin Jr.  leroy bill is not stupid but he is a comedian and ben Shapiro is a lawyer who debates policy for a living, if this was a long format discussion with no quick jokes punctuated with like minded 25 secound applause breaks then him being uninformed and intelectually outclassed would have been far more obvious. If you wrote down every factual point the two made, required every point to be sourced with facts then compared the two i think you would understand Leroy’s comment much easier.﻿

Academic prowess does not equate intelligence at all. His nationally syndicated column is a result of good writing and knowing the right people, still not intelligence. Go look up bret and eric weinstein for real liberal intelligence. Two guys who grew up poor who did bad in the education system but still became scientist.﻿

But turret diving was never an issue for me, except when I thought I’d be safe from the minions just attacking the enemy on their own and I walk into tower like an idiot after a level 3 trade to farm
For no reason
Or if it wanted to 
Cuz like before it only gave yorick aggro if you use your e to send them 
Now I can juggle aggro with the maiden so it’s honestly good
As long as they are making it consistent 
I’m honestly fine with that yorick fix 
Takes timeeee
I only read patch notes like a man
Yeah I’m not gonna watch that shitty video 
Game balance is easy if you just play the game more 
Milo we play a lot of league Xd
We all have a lot of game knowledge 
Yeah but you’ve played for almost over 5 years so you have a right to speak 
They just don’t use them well 
The champs are the same for everyone 
Well they are bad players generally 
I think riot is generally fine in their balance philosophy
But you see yasuos going 20/4 in silver games so he can’t be that difficult for silvers 
Agreed
But if silver players are playing high skill champs at a low skill level, they should be punished for playing poorly 
Like I don’t want to see Yi picked in LCS <e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1542650796186" ts="1542650796" t="61"></e_m>

Ever 
So why should high skill champs be in silver games? 
But at the same time, we don’t want low elo champs in high elo play 
So he isn’t abused my silvers 
But buff something that’s skillful 
Buff azir 
But I’m fine is ryze just isn’t “viable” at low elo
Well not broken, but viable 
But it’s better than the alternative 
There are enough champs that not every champ needs to be played at every elo 
I’m fine if he is balanced like that
Like ryze should be crazy at high elo but dog shit in silver 
High skill characters should be strong but difficult to play you 
How do you even prove to riot that you aren’t a vegetable as a silver player 
Why are there silvers 
...
Because lower elo players can still know a lot if they’ve played for a while
Yeah I agree, what’s the rank distribution of the balance team? 
I agree that they should balance to high elo standards and low elo can go to hell

Oh beanspeak? 
I don’t speak niggernese 
Tengo cena con me madre 
Fuck articuck 
I’m downs 
Weget drunk and do dnd on the beach 
Tonight 
SPEEDWAGON SATURDAY 
I probably have prostate cancer from not nutting 
We stopping no nut? 
NONE OF US WOULD BE HERE WITHOUT CUM 
YUH
LEMME HIT IT RAW LIKE FUCK THE OUTCOME
AY 
Uh 
So I think it would be okay if I made my name Grave Nibber 
There is a guy with the summoner name nibber 
Wait wait wait 
I’m come here to say the n word 
They call me the Grave Ni🅱️🅱️er
We boolin boys? 
Speaking of cumming 
Or else they’ll cum 
Don’t show that to white women 
which was garbage even at the time
based on the 18 year old gamebryo engine
they have essentially one engine
*engine
subjectively 
3 was better tho
new vegas was good too
yeah it all went downhill from 3
guess I gotta stop calling myself a fallout fan soon <ss type="sad">:(</ss>
look at the ground textures and even worse, his backpack WTF
I was
poor fool
and I probably defended todd
and no one recognized it at the time
fallout 4 looked terrible as well
because even gta online looks beautiful and it uses the gta4 engine
but it doesn't have to be
why is fallout 76 ugly
but my question still stands
which was used for gta 4, 5 max payne, and rdr 1
it is, the Rage Engine
why couldn't todd make fallout 76 beautiful
but its beautiful
the engine for Red Dead 2 is 12 years old
wait
and ive only become more toxic
I look better than I did in high schoo;
XD
Milo is a trap
you looked like a goddamn indian

what happened to 2d queen
as does your new photo
it makes me uncomfortable
one cannot question it
hance is awesome
fuck you mars
I say yes?
oh goodness
XD
to decide
bitch im too high 
Imagine releasing a game in 2018 based on an engine from 2003 XD
Shall we discuss? 
Oh goodness 
Damn 
It’s still there 
no me
I was your hands
its true
I've made many friends in that class Dx
And then after he hit me with that gem I said that Latinos should vote if they want society to change to their advantage
They were basically saying that the &quot;American Dream&quot; is bullshit, which I mostly agree with, but I pointed out that America had greater social mobility than the social casts of the UK at the time of independence and throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. And that even though people of color weren't able to experience this social mobility, white people were.
A white guy in my latino studies class said that I don't understand my own privilege and the unique perspective of latinos. I hope he got laid for that
&quot;White privilege is a thing&quot;- Some white knight 
and a racist
No mars he is a symbol of the alt-right
heh redpilled idiot
how you gonna hit my nigma with that shade
XD

When Austin is probably the most transparent rapper about his agenda out there
and a trump issue
I like how the author tried to make this a race issue
&quot;Who allowed this to happen? What hole in the system allowed this greasy discarded barbecue wrapper to prosper? A fake pale king sitting on a tinfoil throne. Return to sender.&quot;
Yeah its pretty surprising
you right
damn
But I actually like that one because it took a complex look at the intricacies of black violence in America 
The Blacker the Berry was a pretty politically charged song
Yeah, but not being political doesn't automatically make you a nazi
Alas perhaps that’s the red pill talking 
Rap shouldn’t be political and post is one of the best non self motivated rappers out there 
That article tilts me tho
Because apparently post Malone is basically Hitler 
Did you guys know not being political makes you a terrible person? 
Joji is woke Miles, I’m sure he wouldn’t even associate with Frank, even though they look similar 
By saying he relies on some RACIST SEXIST HOMOPHOBIC CONTENT FROM A QUARTER DECADE AGO
The artistic integrity of joji 
How dare you try to undermine 
Are you fucking kidding me
Excuse me 
Jonathan wants to know your location 
but cuddling with jonathan joestar seems better to me
That's very good milo
Does anyone want to buy me something terrible?

So

or a gel, yogurt was the first evolution of cheese I think
becomes a solid XD
that's a big brain play 
but having left that milk until it rots and then deciding to drink it?
I mean that aint that crazy, you see a calf drinking it so you give it a try cuz youre hungry
can you imagine being the first person to eat cheese?
chester would have wanted it that way

I mean last time it opened wednesday
no news
wtf is up with clash
more importantly tho
it isn't a fallout game
We just have to remember 
if you know where it is 
It was just nice in the other fallouts to always be able to get the cool weapon
Low level players wont get access
Exactly, people will build around vaults and shit
Like, if you have a set number of unique resources in a open world, there will be competition to acquire said goods
That you have to compete with other plays to acquire good gear and to have decent perks throughout your party 
Looting gear and perks I assume
My problem with 76 is multiplayer games encourage try harding.
Does it just work Miles?
Does it work tho?

As a semi high elo player milo, how do you think turret armor will affect my play style and champ?
I kinda forgot
yeah just feels like that was so long ago

We live in a society where the world's best adc, Michael &quot;Imaqtpie&quot; Santana, is hard stuck in masters 1
Mars, no woman with that tattoo does not have aids
DXXXXX

XD
with all my exes 
we are deceasing
oh yes
yeah I mean ill be home next week so id probably either want to hang out with yall or my family. not play dnd online
I mean he can still change 
individually subjective
ye
When a subjectively good act brings about evil, its lawful evil
objectively 
yeah crusaders aren't good
Idk I didn't think this position wouldn't be universal 
good= moral realism. neutral=moral subjectivism. evil=nihilism
… lawful good isn't a moral compass of subjectivity
so did you
you murdered an innocent man
A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act. He combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. He tells the truth, keeps his word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished.

Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor and compassion.

Lawful good can be a dangerous alignment when it restricts freedom and criminalizes self-interest.
&quot;The Ten Lawful Good Commandments
A list of Ten Commandments for a lawful good religion may look like this:

1.	You shall not lie.

2.	You shall not harm the innocent.

3.	You shall not murder.

4.	You shall help the needy.

5.	You shall honor legitimate authority that promotes goodness.

6.	You shall follow the law.

7.	You shall not betray others.

8.	You shall bring criminals and evil-doers to justice.

9.	You shall not steal.

10.	You shall seek unlimited good for others and unlimited order in society.&quot;
And we could of come up with a nonviolent solution
I don't think genocide is correct 
it was a war tho
The fact of the matter is we acted without having all the information, which is chaotic at best
and the lizards wanted the pygmies off of their home aswell 
and Dar was
That doesn't follow your definition of lawful
You'd rather stop a genocide, which we have only part of the story about,  than keep your closest friends safe? 
So you have a stronger personal line with the pygmies than with your party?
in court
you know
like
before acting
Because law requires you to find all available facts..
Acting without questioning the events that lead up to an event is not lawful
You never asked me what happened with the octopus, you cant just make a rash assumption and say you are good for it
So, if you got captured, would you have held your tongue and gotten executed?
… how does getting captured by lizards and getting left to die at the hands of an octopus make you evil?
every chat is dnd now
indeed
morality is a spook afterall
or does it? idk
oh yeah I guess intent matters more than actions
because I failed every bad thing I tried to do XD
Any other changes to be made?
Yeah I don't think alignment should be set permanently. IDK if its something you want to do milo but you could almost tweak everyone's alignment after each session based on the actions in said session
Heres my two cents, no one in this campaign should be expected to act with extreme heroism unless its part of their character. So that's why I think our treatment of Chester was unfair and I think we should adjust our standards for how we treat npcs in the future based on how we ourselves act. 
Nope that's pretty much it. Yeah I caused Chester to be attacked my the squid monster by my fighting style, it was aggroed onto me initially anyways 
Because a person is responsible for things they cause while being unable to act?

Honestly, it’s surprising that you’ve dealt with it and I haven’t 
“At the rate this metoo shit is going, my hand is gonna sue me for assault soon” 
-Bigga Nigga 2
or is that the weed talkin
and if he lasts till December 7th, I might add, I don't think he needs the punishment? or perhaps less severe
However, I would encourage mars to keep playing
AMEN TO THAT
letting people nut
I feel like that isn't in the spirit of the competition
heres the problem\
im high rn lemme think
that is interesting
oh 
but what was my verdict needed on
wait what happened
I think I know what RAM stands for SCU, thank you very much
like hey, not only have I built multiple computers but I spend 12 hours a day on them 
I wish
I should have been able to opt out of this shit class
&quot;wow how many MB of RAM do you have? woah a whole 100 MB that's crazy&quot;- Idiot from 1995
next she is gonna say we measure cpu speed in MHz or some retarded shit like that
HONESTLY it makes me want to die
FUCK
THE 
WHAT 
in the study guide CATHODE FUCKING RAY TUBE MONITORS ARE LISTED AS A COMMON TYPE OF COMPUTER DISPLAY...
my omis class triggers me
dark souls lore
dark souls lore
Yeah, we have seen it all
so the cycle continues as they rediscover lost relics
but many kids don't know those memes now
but you see, that's the most degenerate edge of normie memes 
And he got us all 
👌 is funny tho
And it’s a fortnite meme 
See it’s great tho 
Does sound work on this? 
Not all new age memes are bad tho 
Yah greentext is strong still
My latest greatest memes are all jojo
and yeah I agree eric
But I feel your pain Milo, even a connoisseur like myself must conduct great research to find the best of memes
There we go, 3/7 is decent
Although most of my great memes are videos
MEEMEE OVERDRIVE
im digging into my special meme chest
alright you cuck
that's decent eric
wait wait milo youre looking at this wrong, the formats are always normie, its how you use it
ill dig into my special collection if these do not appease you milo
I feel like this is a good variety 
one sec lemme take some shots
And actually, many of the good memes come from black instagram
but the trends are negative
I mean miles and I still have a steady supply of high quality memes
Well we are talking generally 
but that isn't the common perception
but im sitting here like, its only slightly funny because of how retarded it is
Because the creators and the viewers are like, haha that's so wacky and funny that they are mimicking our favorite game
The fortnite dances have made me realize that
Perhaps my ironic perception of memes has masked me from the truth
soon we wont understand memes
Also im scared. I've finally come to the realization that meme culture will not be ours forever. and the generation we are handing the gauntlet to is actually overwhelmingly autistic
one of them is a white guy in my latinos studies class who has been blue pilled
Because if the sick die they can’t get the rest of us sick 
I wish the days when having a cough was a death sentence 
After a week of this assault my throat is sore and my disdain for the human race has reached new heights 
The people who sit next to me are sick degenerates who cannot cover their mouths 
I’m two of my classes

&quot;I am Solaire of Astora, an adherent to the Lord of Sunlight.
Now that I am Undead, I have come to this great land, the birthplace of Lord Gwyn, to seek my very own sun!&quot;
—Solaire of Astora, upon first meeting the chosen Undead.
&quot;The way I see it, our fates appear to be intertwined.
In a land brimming with Hollows, could that really be mere chance?
So, what do you say? Why not help one another on this lonely journey?&quot;
—Solaire of Astora, introducing the chosen Undead to summoning.
&quot;We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land.
The flow of time itself is convoluted; with heroes centuries old phasing in and out.
The very fabric wavers, and relations shift and obscure.
There's no telling how much longer your world and mine will remain in contact.
But, use this, to summon one another as spirits, cross the gaps between the worlds, and engage in jolly co-operation!&quot;
—Solaire of Astora, explaining Lordran to the chosen Undead, and giving him the White Sign Soapstone.
&quot;Of course, we are not the only ones engaged in this.
But I am a warrior of the sun! Spot my summon signature easily by its brilliant aura.
If you miss it, you must be blind!&quot;
—Solaire of Astora, explaining the mechanics of online summoning and his gold summon sign to the chosen Undead.
&quot;Oh, hello there. I will stay behind, to gaze at the sun.
The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father!
If only I could be so grossly incandescent!&quot;
I mean that sounds pretty souls to me

basically inting is an idea

Only the winners of no nut November get the privilege of doing that to their bodies
I don't know if its even possible
 perhaps jett is enough of a sadist to do so
I'm not rude enough to prevent that man from nutting
oh I challenge Jett ammore 
Well then ill return my scenario to trap photos unless yall have a better idea 
No one is forcing you too play

I challenged you
wut
indeed
I mean I aint home for a while but ok
Does this answer your question?
your autism is giving me cancer
wtf
You haven't even agreed to not nut yet
No, the challenged gives a challenge to the challenger 
and Mars
The lower portions is the punishments, Parsa and I haven't had ones given to us yet 
you read it left to right you fucking muslim
no he didnt
wait whats this flame going on here
you just cant nut
you can smash

no he decided not to nut on his own accord
because parsa hasn't made a punishment yet
He has been challenged 
I mean the challenges aren't meant to be death sentences, as going outside would be for milo
fair enough 
I mean, pretty cancer 
Parsa challenged mars who has yet to challenge someone
Milo challenged miles who challenged david<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1541100830765" ts="1541100830" t="61"></e_m>
Milo challenged miles who challenged david<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1541100830765" ts="1541100830" t="61"></e_m>
I challenged you 
Everything is in that google doc
Its the rules of the game, handed down to us by the old lords of nut
but no nut
you can fuck
You can fap but you cant nut
oh we just choose someone who we challenge to participate
no nut november
okay I may have made that doc a little too cancerous
Now we just need punishments for mars, parsa, myself , and david if he chooses to play
unless autofilled of course
Alright, nuts in November, he must play 30 games as top in League of Legends in a row
and he must do the same
Yeah you gotta get a punishment for <at id="8:parsa.jourx">Parsa</at> 
I'll use that punishment though but make it more specific
he is already challenged
who do you challenge btw mars?
THIS IS MARS NOW
YES
Well, now Eric just has to accept and challenge david and then the race will begin
Dam
ONE CANNOT DESTROY THEIR DICK TWO MONTHS IN A ROW
BALANCED AS ALL THINGS SHOULD BE
You may only destroy dick December if you no nut november
You are weak willed mars
this is you if you didn't nut this month
this is you mars
YOU ETERNAL CUCK
Excellent
yee
WHO DO YOU CHALLENGE YOUNG SIR?
VERY GOOD
Indeed 
Also, neither Eric or miles has accepted yet 
How bout I send pics of my costume if I fail
tho
i challenged him
what would my failure entail?
It means traps ain’t gay 
And if you fail 
Yeah you will be called a bitch tho 
We will allow this for the sake of the sport 
I don’t want to hear you cucks saying that you can’t do the challenge because you nutted early this morning. 
Oh also 
NONE THE MATTER MARS YOU HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED TO WITHOUT YOUR NUT FOR THE MONTH 
You know parsa watches too much anime because he used the phrase “in other words” 
There are only nutters and nutn’ts
Parsa, there are no winners in this game 
Parsa could take up the challenge out of his own will power 
Indubitably.<context suggestionId="b131877a-c101-4568-a986-d1c26eda9788" impressionGuid="F0B9416807E24F38B968D828E5F226C0" serviceTag="4C324D4B4C7948F3ACD88D5D958C9709" clientId="1501D9B2A2504A90BAE338B4A8AE5122" serviceTraceId="3B557DD58811478EA10F103E43C05F54" suggestionType="Reply" providerId="cortana"></context>
Eric 
I challenge 
It is official then, you are duty bound to not nut Milo Ammore and Miles O’Brien, do you accept this challenge of your honor and will? 
Who is your choice Milo? 
Every participant can challenge one person to take up the challenge with them 
For years I have sought out thots. It has been my goal to destroy them and sow my seeds in their soil for my own mortal pleasure. Unknowingly, this process has made me vulnerable to the one thing I’ve always tried to fight, coochie. I need it, I need coochie real bad. The means which I have taken up to obtain said glorious coochie have been varied. From sympathizing with thots to dawning the guise of a thot. NO MORE I SAY. For in this month of November, there will be no nut. There will be no indulgence of coochie. There will only be peace. 30 days from now, I shall use the wisdom blessed upon me to demolish once again. 
Why tf do I always talk like I’m talking to everyone when I’m only talking to you Milo XD 
We need accountability tho fellas 
No nut is for men 
No shave is for boys 
Nah I’ve done that
Because I am generous 
And furthermore 
Because my life would be a hollow experience if I never got to say I didn’t nut in November 
Yeah I want to do it 
Who is participating in no nut November? 
my guy really asking for pics
pics of what
Close
close
AT WHAT COST
si
All I’ll say is crop tops should be a masculine item of clothing 
XD
Only 
Average 
But what did it cost 
Yes 
*alot
Honestly tho, in the name of coochie a guy really did alit 
Can’t have y’all thinking of me as a trap
Hmmm
I dressed up as a thot
Now that’s scary

No, you don't understand daddy issues milo
no reason to go for pussy
Women can get all the dick they want
I'd call her a greedy fuck

I'd say fag or something and it would reee and call me a sexist or some shit
and I couldn't stand that

I don't want something that looks like me
Is because 
The only reason I wouldn't want a kid

That is so deep, Taric, as a last hope of mankind casts a spell which activates a full 2.5 seconds after the universe ends. This spell gathers all the energy in the universe into a singularity to unleash 2.5 seconds of pure agony upon the multiverse

Tarik can provide a fortress to protect himself or his closest ally. You can select a master

Nah Id only fuck a very attractive man

or dick
and wants ass
a closeted man who is horny 
No im claiming straight gays don't care about looks
this is giving me cancer
that logic threw me for a looperic
...
Not all tops are straight
We are on the same page mars
That's like half the gays
Guys just want a moist hole to schlong
gays don't need it because gays aren't women
attractiveness is to attract a mate
You could look like the mothman and get your dick wet by some closeted married dude
Have you heard of something called grindr mars?

nah gays don't need looks to fuck
Gay people are a small minority so it doesn't behoove a male streamer to be attractive
QT is a 10
I do not lie
Never father
Those guys weren't fuckable 
I agree mars
yes
nah 
jesus fighting over semantics doesn't mean you win the argument
there are few very attractive pro players
okay
That is a shot with good lighting wearing a suit
6.5
but he doesn't look good
He isn't ugly
IDK how the world would react to an attractive chad player
No pro league players are good looking tho

&lt;&lt;&lt; </legacyquote></quote>
This chat was moving to fast to be comprehensible 
I would personally rather watch QT than any female streamer but that is just my opinion 
Except sneaky I guess
Yes because makeup is a competitive advantage women have over men
no one watches qt or ninja for looks
and attractiveness is a quality that guys don't use on twitch
skill&gt;attractiveness but attractiveness is a huge boost
Invalidating one statement doesn't cripple this argument
Wait whats wrong about what we are saying
Asians don't need much makeup anyways tho
*fewer
Because few women stream
Podcast
Like a uh
I agree
Only if I go first miles, don’t want you stretching it out
No male streamer could get away with being garbage 
Remember Kaceytron???? she was hot garbage
But that's just because I feel more comfortable with less done up women 
I do think she looks better without makeup tho
I know
If no one was watching she wouldn't be done up
which is what poki does
Wait, women don't wear makeup when they are at home playing video games
IDK I just feel like funny shit goes on with us
Which would catch on in the right format
Although I do think we have a pretty interesting dynamic as a group
streaming is way easier for women
We should go smallest to largest I think? 
They aren’t particularly good at games either which hurts their case further 
First of all, women aren’t funny so they have to look good to get attention 
Wait look at actresses in movies, society has an expectation for women to look a certain way
True true
Would yall gangbang a hooker in Amsterdam with me?
You saw nothing
pewds hates thots
When I think they should be treated as property 
Yeah but human rights activists want them to have rights independent of their parents

Appreciating the masculine form is probably the least gay thing one can do 
It’s not gay 
Miles gets it

A cross dresser being the best adc in league 
Imagine 
I’d rather c9 win than me be right 
Same 
But that’s because c9 sucks 
I think I did too 
Someone kick milo

Do you think fnatic is going to semi?

Knock ups? 
Weird is ok 
Maybe? 
But make tenacity work against it 
Keep it 6 
It cucked me in a ranked game yesterday. I feel their pain 
Honestly vision denial is way too strong with that ult
It was disgusting, especially with the lights out from noc 
Like 
That’s almost an xpeke moment 
Honestly that baron steal. 16 hp
But ss usually cucked him
I mean he had some good plays
Not everyone can pull madL hooks 
I mean it’s a support 
Tusin was playing for c9 for two of those games 
To be fair
A clean fucking sweep 
NA NA NA NA NA NA
HOLY
I almost want af to win, these are incredible to watch 
I love it... if only it was 4/4/4/4/4/4/4/4/4/4/4/4
16HP
That was FUCKING LIT
HOLY SHIT 
Butt pirate xd
He did mad damage 
But like that’s obvious inting 
Not as easily at least 
Indeed, he can’t int on thresh tho
Imagine your mental if you got smacked twice in a row by a trap 
I don’t think it’s too early 
I bet that is correct 
!!
TRUMP IS PAYING HIM
LOL
I’d give him the good dick 
If he wins 
I’d make him my woman 
Hehe 
Obama did not contribute to competitive league in NA
Honestly 
Thank you gamers! We have made NA great again 
I hope trump tweets about c9 going to semi finals 
You are SK’s only hope 
Because Ali has thrown the last two games 
They need to sub you in
You gotta call Af right now 
Milo 
Yikes 
Fuck up one person and slow everyone else 
Like 
It makes her too strong especially cuz she has such hard cc with her e 
But mostly glacial 
And graves being stupid 
Glacial won them that game 
Ban runes 2019
Honestly 
This 
Guess I should go pro 
He has missed more combos than I did that one game 
Honestly it’s winning them the game. The whole fucking river was slowed 
XD
The blue buff mvp tho
Dude look at sneaky’s lead. He has this game 
Because I know that aatrox would fuck most champs up in s dive like that
That one hurt to watch 
Imagine getting solo killed as aatrox in worlds
Deja Gj
Ooooh vro spicy 
Hand to mouth coordination 
Let’s find out summoners 
I wonder if they will be able to slow the pace enough 
IM HYPED 
Solo queue legends are strong early tho
I mean 
*fight 
Af might be able to pull together due to their strong right 
Honestly yeah 
The legend of soloqueue, graves 
NOW THIS IS A GOOD GSME 
HOLY 
RYZE TOP
So am I 
Why are you like 3 minutes ahead 
Wait 
KAISA EZ
Mid game is the key 
Then they will win easy 
If mid gets pressured this game by af
Honestly
They are rude 
Dx 
<ss type="sad">:(</ss>
Imagine getting subbed in worlds 
Can’t shut down sneaky that easy I guess 
Yeah, I thought af had it with the gank bot tho
Which was very unlucky 
And kass kinda got stomped 
Yah 
Perhaps, I would have liked to seen a fiora or Darius pick over a mage 
Idk seemed kinda cuckish to me
But to be so afraid of aatrox that you ain’t willing to get close 
Like
That viktor pick was such a beta play 
I bet c9 will lose the next two and then take the last two 
O 
POGGERS
C9 beat afreeca
Not never 
Not now 
No way 
No homo tho
I like you  : )
Excellent 
Now miles has the meme 
King of the trees?

What 
He thinks he is captain knots or something 
Look at this guy

Get real
6 I’d get gold 1
So 8 wins I’d get plat 5
I wonder if it’s every 2 winds= 1 division closer to where you were 
I’d still be at worst gold 4 
I mean 
And I’ll have more time 
I guess starting from low gold will make it an easier climb
<ss type="sad">:(</ss>
Plz
Kill me
I’m plat 4

A theory: Side Niggas are the cause of all extreme thottery. The polygamous nature of thots is only sustainable because of nice guys who will look past their deeds and take them back in. Alas, this return is always temporary as the thot will always acquire a new target.

Skins are alternate realities that don't have to connect to canon. It's why we get skins that are vastly different than the default themes like Surprise Party Fiddlesticks and Lumberjack Sion.

League let me slip through into gold and then turned a blind  eye as a rampaged my way through the garbage pit of gold.

Find out next time

Well now wait just a minute. Alright bucko, you just hold your horses. I've just about had it with you son of a gun. Newsflash pal, its over for you and listen here buddy, if I catch you pulling that shit again, God as my witness, you're done.
Idk why it was so spot on, and then drives away in an expensive car 
I kinda wish it did. It would have been better if I said Thanks Kanye, very nice 
I swear on harambe I didn’t make this one up 
Yeah it was a good meme
So I gave him $20, he told me to buy his new merch, and then he got into a Lamborghini and drove away 
And he said thanks and then asked me for $10
And I told him that I liked Ye and that the haters were dummy boys 
And Kayne West was ahead of me so I went up to say hi to him

Wait what did I do?
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little &quot;clever&quot; comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Eric’s definition of gay is a little off 
Also

you should leave it be

He looks like the type of guy who knows
That man is obviously of high intellect Miles
Seriously though, is Riot Games run by fucking retards let loose by their handlers?
&quot;For example, the expectation that you probably won’t win—you’ll probably lose—is a really nice element. In League, statistically if matchmaking is working really well, you’re going to lose about half of your games. &quot;
Can we talk about how autisic riot is for a second?
I cant wait for Fall of Duty 76
But new Vegas was the better game 
I think 3 was a better fallout game 
MILES YOUR A RACIST 
WRONG 
Oh definitely. By changing to first person rpg, Bethesda was able to appeal to idiot kids AND show off some pretty insane graphic and gameplay capabilities for the time.
Only 3D women vro 
Milo I didn’t say anything 
Why would you call Dad a fag?

How have you produced so many weeb children Dad

I’ve only seen three anime 
Maybe it was just the player, but it seemed like it was at a slower pace to me
Does it seem like your movespeed is slower than in doom?

The key to being a man whore is to be both erogenous and slightly androgynous 
This is true, but my hairless chest is an excellent contrast to my gorilla legs 
It’s the only way Milo 
To defeat the thots as the prophecy entails, I must become the world’s greatest <b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">man whore</b>
But anyways 
They are hollowed 
They are things which feed on the souls of men 
Women are something far from human
Furthermore, I’ve learned how to slay the thots 
therefore, only men can be queens 
Milo, you ignorant slave, how quickly you’ve forgotten. IF SHE BREATHS SHE IS A THOT 
This ain’t gay 
GAY AS FUCK 
Or, “I’m too tired” or “Michael, get the towel” 
“I’m on my period, we can’t fuck this week”. Now that shit is gay 
You wanna know what’s gay?

Why was I kicked when Milo changed the title? 
Wait 
And difficult to hit if the enemy engages you 
It’s really easy to read 
So I feel like moving some damage there would be balanced 
Yeah, because it is kinda weird to hit

In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bile of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.
And free the queens of our world from that curse 
To live eternally with that burden

The fire fades, and the yordles go without thrones 
In climbing up their own asses, the summoners discover the truth in the old word
Where the transitory lands of the fucking cancerous champions converge 
It is called bandle city
Indeed
Also, Bandle City exists in multiple places at once, kinda like Voldemort or the schizophrenic
Valoran is now 86ed, runeterra is canon again, except it looks different from the earlier renderings 
New runeterra map 
wait I thought runeterra was shitcanned
In traveling North, the pilgrims discover the truth of the old word
Where the transitory lands of the lords of cinder converge
talk to me brother, im in a mood for tilt
ranked makes me sad boi
Ah yes little one, the greatest sacrifices require big blue balls 
It is too well grounded in reality because it follows a traditional format and is referencing a semi recent event 
But like this is a level 1 surreal meme 
Despacito is better, true 
We knew we would lose them eventually 
Give them up
Miles, it’s 2018, surreal memes are becoming meta 
I just don't know when id listen to it
yeah it sounds ok
is head in the clouds good?
That reminds me of one time
speak brother
oh thank god
smh ninja already died of ligma
shit
WOAAAH you got sugma dude?
damb, really on bofa these nuts
LIGMA BALLS MARS
ay miles, you got ligma?
Ooh
Y
A dark spirit has invaded your world 
I always do my play throughs with reversal ring, so I can have feminine movements on my male waifu 
There is a ring in dark souls 3, specifically to assist in cross dressing...if y’all didn’t know 
Y’all like mound makers? 
yall looking like you don't say thank you to the bus driver
s  T o P c H a N g I n G  t H e T I T l E
Ah, hello! You don't look Hollow, far from it! I am Solaire of Astora, an adherent of the Lord of Sunlight. Now that I am Undead, I have come to this great land, the birthplace of Lord Gwyn, to seek my very own sun! … Do you find that strange? Well, you should! No need to hide your reaction. I get that look all the time! Hah hah hah! Oh, ah hah! So, I didn't scare you? I have a proposition, if you have a moment. The way I see it, our fates appear to be intertwined. In a land brimming with Hollows, could that really be mere chance? So, what do you say? Why not help one another on this lonely journey? This pleases me greatly! Well then, take this. We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land. The flow of time itself is convoluted, with heroes centuries old phasing in and out. The very fabric wavers, and relations shift and obscure. There's no telling how much longer your world and mine will remain in contact. But, use this, to summon one another as spirits, cross the gaps between the worlds, and engage in jolly co-operation! Of course, we are not the only one engaged in this. But I am a warrior of the sun! Spot my summon signature easily by its brilliant aura. If you miss it, you must be blind! Hah hah hah! Oh, hello there. I will stay behind, to gaze at the sun. The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father! If only I could be so grossly incandescent! Oh, there you are. You've been quiet these days. Smooth summoning out there? Anytime you see my brilliantly shining signature, do not hesitate to call upon me. You've left me with quite an impression. I would relish a chance to assist you. You really are fond of chatting with me, aren't you? If I didn't know better, I'd think you had feelings for me! Oh, no, dear me. Pretend you didn't hear that! Hah hah hah!
why doesn't dad love me : (
When you walk past Dad but he doesn’t recognize you UwU
yall got ligma?
wait
its a painful climb
rip john
I am sad because Ive realized I don't like going through high wall, undead settlement, road of sacrifices, or the swamps of farron keep
but I wanna do different ng+0 builds : (
also
: ^ )
yeaaa only 5 months
I am officially #reformed
I made it to honor level 2 bby
Watch as the master of Aatrox, the destroyer of worlds, the legend from challenger himself, Michael Imaqtpie Santana invades the Twisted Treeline to reclaim his throne as best player NA. By unearthing the ancient artifacts, wooglet's witchcap and lord van dam's pillager, Michael is able to singlehandedly hunt down the notorious legends: Vilemaw, East Alter, and level 5 yasuo. You've been warned, he is coming for you next.
I just like memes
It got them publicity, therefore, success. In the immortal words of Larry the Cable Guy, &quot; All publicity is good publicity&quot;.
it didn't fail
Jett
I really like this guys effort
Traps are NOT gay and I am here to prove it. Let's start with logic thinking. We will apply these questions to a trap, and it will help determine if they are gay. Does the person have a masculine penis? No, they have a feminine penis. Is the person a man? No, they are called dickgirls for a reason. Does a man have a numerical value of 1? No, not only is that not the case, but a man (or a woman) has no numerical value. This is nonsense. Is it gay to be <b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">***ed by a girl? No, if this was the case then all heterosexual sex would in fact be homosexual in nature. Suffice to say, I think we can all agree that traps are not gay using quick and easy logic thinking. Now, we will use imagination thinking to imagine a situation in which you are having sexual intercourse with a trap. Ok, so like imagine this chick; but she's this totally ***</b>ing SMOKING hot chick, and she's got really sexy titties and a sexy butthole that you can pound and a sexy little feminine penis you can stroke and suck. Did that feel gay? I thought not. We have used both of the types of thinking to solve the mystery of if traps are gay. They are not. I have used indisputable science techniques to skip the hypothesis completely and go straight to a proof. Science thinking is a secret third type of thinking that many people don't have so this may be a difficult concept to grasp for some. I am happy to explain my theorem further and am opening this thread to discussion.
only thots travel milo
and akali looks like a thot
Thots are gay
that shit is gay
waaait imma have to report riot
First you take two slices of black rye bread and burn the blyat out of them. Then you boil 1.5L of water and throw the bread in there with a bunch of raisins. Then after 3 or more hours, extract the bread and the raisins and filter all the blins from the liquid remaining. Then add 100g of sugar and a teaspoon of yeast to the liquid and store it in a couple of hermetic jars for a couple days with some raisins. After that, filter the kvass again, add some lemon, and enjoy
boys I know the recipe like the back of my hand

The outcome of one of them is determined by a random number generator. The outcome of the other is determined by a coin flip.
you guys know what the difference between hearthstone and league is?
ye very spicy, definitely more spartan than survival
wait gameplay machine out?
alright squad
feel like they are doing too much
seems too good to be true
fallout 76
<ss type="heart">&lt;3</ss>
im gold
its official boys
I mean they didn't wanna completely change him design wise
That trailer made me so flaccid to think that it’ll be online 
Oh well, I’ll just waste my money on METRO EXODUS BABYYYYY
.
^(
.
Like 
im so sad they are removing banner
wait
xdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
catch you slipping?
whats the fun in that
calamity is still my fav
So its basically for people who want to wear the firekeeper's set and crossdress
and thats all
the reversal ring does: Use the animations of the opposite gender (run and walk animations, emotes, etc.)
oh miles
I mean i just go shieldless
because rolling is always better than blocking
13 feels pretty strong
its true, depraved&gt;havel set
Its true, my equip load was low as well so I had a full 13 iframes per roll
and I always praise the sun before engaging in combat
Guys, I got into a fight with a dirty liberal today. Thankfully I was still in my iframe when she threw a punch, I rolled straight through that strike. She wasn't a very good fighter though, I just strafed behind her and landed a critical backstab. Be safe out there fellas. 
I have his armor bruh
3 is the best
I'm glad we understand
I S T H A T B I G G D A D 
Yeah it’s 40 I thought 
But why didn’t they just charge $60 and make it work correctly? 
xdd 
Then you’re shit out of luck 
And what if you get into a situation like miles where your Witcher copy breaks because you modded it? 
I just want to throw Gabe my money and get into the game 
Having to modify a game takes time and brainpower= a burden 
It shouldn’t be the consumer’s burden 
And if it does, then it was manufactured at a subpar level which means yes, it is shit 
The car shouldn’t have a bad paint job out of the factory...
Yeah that’s true Milo, but wouldn’t you say the game is pretty trash if it needs a mod to get an acceptable frame rate? 
But that’s to fuck around, not to play 
Which also break the game but i do use console sometimes 
Like console commands are one thing 
Why would I tarnish the intended experience though? 
*mod
I never nod anything really 
I never modded new Vegas 
The game is objective shit if it’s broken at release 
Mods don’t make it not shit 
If a game is unplayable on release 
Wait 
Because DS3 is actually a game 
Have y’all sought tisim?
Wait

and then everyone started clapping
Yes milo
Wow that story was so heartwarming. Can we get 11 likes? 1 like=1 machine of freedom
Guys, I was in class when all of a sudden a Trump Supporter stormed into the classroom. He was wearing an American flag shirt. Before he could say anything I stood up and said my culture isn't your t-shirt. In agony, he ran out of the room crying for his Mom. As I sat down everyone started clapping and the professor gave everyone in the class an A. 
wait this isnt a league chat
maybe in a dream
perhaps you have seen it
its sneaky?
Yet as the mighty Titan fell and dread engulfed the armies of Doom, the demon priests of the Blood Temples laid a trap to capture this scourge of Hell. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Great One, the Hell Walker sought prey in the tombs of the Blood Keep. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the temple upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering.
And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer in a mighty armor, wrought in the forges of Hell, impenetrable and unyielding. With sword and shield of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void.
None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the abyss rose The Great One, a champion mightier than all who had come before. The Titan, of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon the plain and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. The Titan fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow horde were routed.
The age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the tablets of Hell across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.
And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the seraphim bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Blood Temples. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the nine circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.
Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before.
In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.
get with it boys
this is a dark souls chat
that was some nice cheese pizza mars

Because the story of leaving the vault to reclaim the wastes and wage war against the anarchocommunists of the wastes

alright bby boys
cuz its Tuesday my dudes 
Time to extend our arms, stiffen up our bodies, and praise the fucking sun y'all
Here are some hateful gestures, make sure you know them so you can spot them
or something

YOU CANT WIN WITH THAT CHAMP MILO
NO
A is better
no
yall know what is better than e?
Just sap experience from the wave and be a deadweight 
Then why the fuck do you have to attack the wave 
If it’s a matter of experience 

But if the lane is frozen in a good spot don't tax it
I mean its a situational case. If the lane gets shoved so tower resets and denies the enemy a wave then go ahead, tax.
Actually no
which is nice
Although I guess the promise of tax will prompt more ganks
Sounds like cancer
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
When the link of gold is threatened, the queue check rings unearthing the old guardians from their graves. T3mplarKnight, level 30 from the deep. Huckleberryfun’s boosted legion: the Trick2G Army. And the reclusive player of the profaned rank, InGodWeTristana the platinum. Only in truth will the lords abandon their thrones. And the silver will rise. Domeless, boosted monkeys, not even fit to be gold. And so it is that silver seeketh gold 
That is inconceivable.

Yall resonate sound quite well because YALL ACOUSTIC 
I got a 53 
I love
that thiccer thann sneaky
thats thiccer than clam chowder with crackers crumbled into it
that's beautiful
I almost didn't recognize him...because he sounds like every single other sad artist
I can hardly tell, he sounds so different
wait miles is that even joji
Not another assassin 
I think we need another traditional tank 
Pyke, the Bloodharbor Ripper 
It’s a new league character 
Milo you memes me so hard I can’t take it 
LOL I THOUGHR YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ROHIT 
Are y'all ready for Dyke, the Bloodharbor Shitter?
Who wants to watch Requiem for a Team with me
anyways
That was such a good game tho
loadout was fun
that's sad tho
team
I just realized something
waaaait
it is known
I’m glad we agree traps aren’t gay 
im with it
no
wait I need to jerk off, if that game has a chance to be good, my erection is unstoppable
its conan dude
I have mod for this
82% of reviews since launch have been positive
I bought this about a year ago, played it for an hour, and refunded it. It was terrible. There was not one single redeeming factor outside of the lore.

What this game is today is nothing short of a miraculous turn-around in the gaming industry. I have never seen a game go from absolutely unplayable to the greatest game of its genre. And make no mistake, this game is certainly the greatest in the genre. 

It is rare that I re-visit a game. I cannot express how glad I am for giving Conan Exiles another chance.

+Fluid gameplay. No stutters, no crazy pop-in.
+Combat is great. You'll get your fill of gore from this one.
+Building mechanics are top shelf. The breadth of construction capabilities is large, and the crafting mechanics are sound, fun, and challenging.
+Solo play? No problem! The thrall system can offset any online difficulty. One man can do a LOT of damage in the game. The solo &quot;campaign&quot; is also very fun.
+Lore. I mean... it's the Conan ip. It captures the atmosphere very well.
+No dinosaurs. 
+Native 21:9 Support
+Graphics options allow a large range of pc's to perform well.
+PERFECT game to watch Netflix, Youtube, or listen to podcasts to.

-Rocky, rocky start. It is going to take a lot to convince prior players to give it another shot.

I genuinely cannot think of any other cons. This game is amazing.
is in 1.0v
conan
guys
wait
but I have difficulty playing dark souls for more than an hour at a time
Frostbite makes me soft

I want gooberto to 1v1 parsa 
Wait 
I could see it 
Or assaulting his friends via internet 
Beating up a flight attendant for spilling his drink 
Or like 
Beating his significant other 
Like 
Why parsa tho? Terrorism? 
I’d say mars 
I’d sue 
And if they denied me that 
I’d just ask to go to lady jail 
So I give it a 👌
I see Eric has considered this 
How’d you figure? 
What prison gang would y’all join? Or would you go solo? 
No I threatened to do it via auto response 
Will y’all visit me? 
If I get sent to cry baby prison 
Interesting 
Is threatening to mow down a crowd of people with a car against Skype TOS?

I like that japan is the only overwatch one

How tf you gonna get bitches with hair like that bruh
I liked mars better when he wasn't gay
the admiral himself
same
Did you have the Kruber Experience?
He is a wild equestrian 
He just existed 
But then 
I beat his ass in lane 
Same 
He doesn’t tho 
What is the ideal amount of horsepower then? 
But the higher horsepower, the higher the base health 
I forgot to take that into account 
Warm bloods typically heal for 50% of their max health per 8 seconds 
It depends if they are warm bloods or Spanish 
Especially if he has a spirit visage? JESUS 
Yes, he still heals like a fucking horse. Grievous wounds don’t do shit 
Because he just gets stupid 
*lane 
Because it doesn’t matter how much he feeds in labs 
Which makes me soft 
rather than reducing the healing
Okay, why does riot break mundo and then their duct tape and cum solution is to nerf the cost of his ult

Are invertebrates?

no other streamer is as generous as Imaqtpie. You may often see people debating how much money he makes, and wondering how he still manages to look homeless as he wears $850 dollar Gucci shoes. Well, ladies and gentlemen, here is his secret. He does not share his material wealth, because he wishes to share his in-game wealth. Michael &quot;feed lord&quot; Santana is willing to feed the vicious and hungry beasts of solo queue no matter how much they attack him. There is enough to go around for all. His ultimate mission? Giving some LP to his parallel universe self, DeathPie, who is drowning in the depths of Bronze V.
may the 3rd be with you all
already?

Y'all remember the Illegal Immigranates?
so i am unhappy
ADC mains are happy
Finally my comrades, the adc golden era is back, Infinity Edge is the hammer of justice to bring down any pesky tank, League of Legends will be fun again THANKS LORD. Now draven will come back to meta with ridiculous true damage axes on late game, Caitlyn sniping mages from afar with rapidfire cannon, tristana melting enemies and my all time favorites Jhin with (if this changes really make to live), believe it or not, FREE TRUE DAMAGE... wait theres more, Imagine My dear darling Jinx with AOE TRUE DAMAGE ON FISHBONES PLUS RUNNAN HURRICANE... OMG OMG OMG, I'M SO HYPED I COULD BURST... if this changes come true... riot will have provided us adc mains with TOO MUCH POWER...
Well I'd rather my adc survive longer, even if that means the tank gets shredded quicker. He isn't going to struggle killing anything, he is just going to crit for substantially less. 
he does less damage with ie and pd built
against squishy targets with less than 110 armor
yasuo is actually getting nerfed by new ie

Sit down child and let me tell you the tale of Michael &quot;Imaqtpie&quot; Santana. The trials and tribulations of one of the greatest men to have ever walked this earth. Twenty years ago, with my very eyes boy, I saw Imaqtpie win the west.

Scarra could, but I doubt the “mmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmmms” would be right 
Except qt himself 
No one has it in them to be Pegasus 
OOH TYLER WOULD BE KAIBA 
But qt is Yugi, small cat is yami, Miles can be Tristan, and Chapanya would be Joey
It would be Yugioh
I want a qt anime 
&quot;Making it easier for champions from a range of positions/classes to carry, so teams aren't as dependent on their marksman's damage output every game to be successful. A fed mid, top or jungle champ should more often be a good choice for a team to rally around and support.&quot;
Finnish is best
And then play against those monkas 
So, what if we matchmake on the EUN servers or something 
That is a lot of language, we need set insults for each 
“Chupa mi polla tú homo mono”
I took two quarters of Spanish for this 
Understandable captain 
Inconceivable. My read on the current meta is lackluster 
Now hit me with that important miles 
Thanking you Bilo and Bars
Or a ladykiller interaction 
Or would it be a charisma check 
Y’all ever try to convince a thot to let you smash and then you get this shot popping up: [SPEECH (49/50)]
Thanks riot
After popping the hood on Honor, we're seeing that the path back from dishonor is a bit too harsh. So now it's less steep. There are no other changes to Honor.

Varus
[Context - new active component added, old effect moved to passive &amp; damage adjusted.]
Blighted Quiver (W):
Passive damage lowered from 10/14/18/22/26 to 5/9/13/17/21
New Active - 
Cooldown: 40 seconds at all ranks
&quot;Active: Varus' next Piercing Arrow deals bonus magic damage equal to 6/7/8/9/10% to 9/10.5/12/13.5/15% of the target's missing health (scales with Piercing Arrow charge). 

Blighted Quiver is capped at 360 damage against monsters.&quot;
well that was the lore change a couple patches ago, miles means the w active
on pbe or live?
varus changes?
only after the pie himself
Also voy is the second sexiest pro league player

Let’s see what David has to say 
And that Kaiba is okay to fantasize about 
Is that anything above a level 3 is gay
I think what we’ve learned tonight 
I’m certain he has a kuriboh between his legs 
Or does he 🤔
It can’t be gay 
It’s Kaiba boy 
I mean 
And it wouldn’t be gay 
Who here would fuck the shit out of Kaiba Boy
Wait wait wait 
A true man’s man 
Pegasus isn’t gay, he is a very macho guy
That’s Pegasus 
I’m only as gay as Pegasus 
Please defer to this diagram when you wish to evaluate the gayness of a trap 
fixed it boys
HOLY MY BOY HAMILL

According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
&quot;What's the difference?&quot;
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody &quot;dawg&quot;!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
&quot;You like jazz?&quot; No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
&quot;Mama, Dada, honey.&quot; You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, &quot;Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?&quot;

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your &quot;experience.&quot; Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
&quot;They mak
Now time for the real one 
Holy shit I didn’t think that would work
According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
&quot;What's the difference?&quot;
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody &quot;dawg&quot;!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
&quot;You like jazz?&quot; No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
&quot;Mama, Dada, honey.&quot; You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, &quot;Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?&quot;

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your &quot;experience.&quot; Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

Shouldn't Pedosexuals be grouped into LGBT? 
&quot;The table is now out of use but, that is okay, we still have more tables&quot;- Borat's Older Brother
that's not what I said
because, if she had ass that I could look at for 2 minutes in loading screen, I wouldn't ban her
Look fellas, all I'm trynna say is that abilities shouldn't win the game, the players should win the game
I am saying that if you give someone a 3000 damage nuke skillshot that is really hard to hit, it isn't fair even if it only hits 5% of the time
Again, champion balance shouldn't be based on the chance of them not hitting their shots
I'll ban irelia every game

And then I woke up, shocked that Milo had to see Zoe at all 
But when we arrived at Valhalla, it was just an alley with Zoe in it.  Before Zoe could do anything, Milo reminded her that he banned her in champ select and made that hoe begone. 
And then Guy pulled around in his low rider and told us it was time, so we all climbed into his trunk and at that point he drove us to Valhalla 
Basically we were all booling around and Guy Fieri was there. And he told us he would deliver us to Valhalla if we showed our worth by being as blatantly racist as possible. So then we somehow pulled an inverse warboy and painted ourselves black and then just started yelling racial epithets and acting like prime human specimen  
and that's ok by me

Apologies for my error fellas, the TRUE interval for a 99% confidence level is 10.12&lt;x(bar)&lt;13.88.
We are confident that 99% of the intervals of  we construct will capture the true mean of female Japanese pornography professionals. For a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 4 years and an alpha level of 1%, based on a sample of 30 with the mean age of the actresses being 12, the interval 11.27&lt;x(bar)&lt;12.73 will capture the true mean age 99% of the time.

A:“You underestimate my subjectivist views on morality!”
OB: “Don’t try and turn away from your own instinctual connection to the moral absolutes.”
“You were the chosen one. You were supposed to destroy the egoists, not join them! You were supposed to bring balance to morality, not leave it in chaos!”
A: “I hate moral truths”

zoinks
although,  obviously not so for ethan 
i also hate when autists have big shlongs, i feel like its a waste
Gotta get that bbc
Nah, J williams dude
I wonder if ethan and Ian would invite Jelani over
ofc from dad
but autistic cum? I feel like that would not be good
Cum is the refreshing treat you get after some hard work digbo
but autistic cum seems gross to me
okay i don't find cum gross
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
DAD I STUBBED MY TOE
dad will spank you bareassed 
THATS MY DAD
ZOINKS
Such a beautiful thing
Id be your gay lover
Milo, if we were autistic
gay love is easy tho
i just broke out laughing in the middle of my law class
i was completely unprepared for that
oh yea i do
not really
I inject semen into david
¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯
*8
So maybe david is the biggest winner, he gets to laugh at 7 dumbasses
we project absurdity onto him
That this group chat is just an amalgamation of surreal humor in which we each find at least one person so absurd and we are found absurd by at least one other
I have a theory
i like bigga bibba Xd
eggcelent
Would y’all rather have a well structured and thought out joke? Or surreal humor? 
O sorry, BIBBER

You are very VERY  fucking angry and you have been for thousands of years
Remember your motivation
weapon upgrades are nice and so are some praetor upgrades
just make sure you pick up the argent upgrades, those let you increase your max health, shield, or ammo
not necessarily, there are collectables across the map you can find, but they arent necessary

That’s over 200 pods
Our entire capital is $400 of Juul pods 
It’s called “$400 worth of Juul Pods Coin”
Do you guys wanna invest in my new crypto? 
only because you've asked so nicely
soon
Take an entire galaxie composed of a giant Juul pod, and another galaxie of Juul and take the biggest hit possible 
Why stop there? 
But wait<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1517254598960" ts="1517254598" t="61"></e_m>
But weight 
That’s the way to do it 
Then go to the battery section and pour the napalm everywhere and light up
Go to the juice vat and drink 2.54 gallons of juice
With 5 gallons of napalm
We must advance further, what if you when to the juul pod factory
YEA?
FUCK
and tape down a lighter and eat that
then eat the pods
take the juice out and snort it
Take $450 worth of juul pods
You are really gonna make me do this? 
and then you take a fatter rip out of the bowl
And you put 6 juuls into each mouth piece
You take a hookah
How about this
AND THEN LIGHT THE CIGS AND TAKE A RIP OUT OF THE JUUL
AND THEN YOU HOT GLUE TWO CIGS ON THE INTAKES OF THE JUUL
YOU TAKE A JUUL
OKAY HEAR ME OUT

IF HE BREATHES, HE MAKES YOU MISS EM WITH THAT THOT SHIT 
All men are kings 
i bless the rains down in afrrrrrrrica
im in class tho
is it gay or nah
but guys
NO
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, &quot;Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you&quot;
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(Ah, gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
someone solve this problem for me, what derivative do i need to take?
that leads to an infinite regression
wait
but you are also kissing all the guys she ever kissed
i mean you are basically kissing all the girls he ever kissed
is it gay to kiss a man?
lets be honest
hey bibbas
my cock couldn't take it
I'm pretty sure
I'm pretty shook my dude
but I don't know if they know they are both talking to the same guy
They are like Jews 
I mean 
That’s a little far 
Well 
All I’m trying to do is respect women 
We would never get jobs? 
And connected to us 
If our chat logs got released 
Y’all ever think 
I respect women so much that I want them to rot in prison if they fuck up 
Women are held accountable for their actions 
Y’all want a joke? 
But I know it wears the skin of the devil 
My burrito still looks like a burrito 
Heck ye
I’ll let you know 
The burrito will be in my mouth soon my dude 
Which one, isn’t a meat, and two, I’m vegan now 
The only meat they have at the Mexican place rn is soyrizo 
Also

and I’m skinless silver Mundo
Life is league 
And I’m a fork
Life is soup
I'm 0/2 so far
I wanna see the Dota GENIOUS

Alright, I expect it soon

and then my brain stopped
I kept up with her in cs for the first two waves tho
Well... in defense of myself, i was playing against lux
i did not even realize i was inting
bruh, i was deadass deceased last night
synapse destruction is a problem among the population of this chat
idk what the second quest is
300xp for one ranked win
Are yall starting in 2 weeks?
 Do y’all think it’s some hecking retard shit that riot is incentivizing early ranked play with those quests? 
Is team still teaming 
i shouldnt have used my gay bomb
goddamn it

idk if we should jump into the hottest pepper

carolina reapers
and then listen to each other suffer
and eat them

DONT MAKE ME DO IT
You saw past my doki doki 
Why make other people put their energy and caring to waste by having them spend it on me?”
What reason is there to do anything when I fully know how worthless I am?
Because most days, I can’t even find a reason to get out of bed.
Why do you think I’m late to school every day?
I’ve had really bad depression my whole life.
I guess I have no choice this time.
You’re really just going to make me say it, aren’t you?
You could give me some S U C C
Because there is no space between us
Alright Mars, why does this represent youandme?

Blue-eyes white dragon, direct attack Milo 
Now I summon 
HA you fell straight into my trap card 
 Your decaying corpse will make a fine addition to the already fertile  silt loam in the Nile river valley 
Milo, I will bury you under six feet of loamy sand
Your lack of knowledge in sand disturbs me admiral 
Not knowing the difference between sand, clay, silt and all their many variations <e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1515772048191" ts="1515772048" t="61"></e_m>

Not knowing the difference between sand, clay, silt and all there many variations 
I’m fucking sick and tired of you guys 
So should I get a burrito for lunch? 
My stomach doesn’t seem to be too happy that I’ve eaten almost only burritos this week 
So here is a quandary 
If you gag them they can't scream rape
Women are shit, i don't need to tell em that
Vanilla is fucking gay
Message me when the game starts
I could go one at a time 
Well
I’d send you guys all three gigabytes of it if I could 
That was digbo’s porn 
You know I had to do it to em
Monday fam 
Actually we will be back on the same day 
TYLER1 WILL BE BACK 
GUYS THEY ARE FREEING TYLER 
Hey same 
Take my favorite meme of the year 
I think it’s a sophist 
I wonder who the other guy is 
We can get to the bottom of it
Also I reposted it, so I wanted to throw in some hints of irony 
Well he is saying that he only seems like a wise guy because the other guy is such an idiot 
It’s more of a roast for Plato 
“For you” 
“You’re a big guy”
“It would be extremely painful”
The original was, “what would happen if I removed that mask” 
I think it was a roast 
It was bane’s line on the plane, I don’t know why he said it
And bane
Oh, it’s a reference to Plato’s cave 
? 
I made a meme guys 
Understandable
Or a purple pill that’s just viagra
Or a pink pill that transports you to the Gay 🅱️i🅱️🅱️a realm 
A white pill that kills every back person 
A green pill that kills you
Would y’all rather eat a blue pill that tastes purple 
But it can be now 
I didn’t catch his name 
To all the new memes we will find
Rip Francis tho, even the greatest legends die
A month out of practice is balls
Imma be worse at league than parsa when I get back tho 😪 
Also, only 9 days till I can return to existence 
I have no clue what y’all are nutting about 
My delay is excellent
But other than that I haven’t seen the new one, I’ll be seeing it on new years 
I think Kylo Ren is a dumb cunt 
No crying in baseball
My dad is a computer 
Idk why he doesn’t have it, I just called spectrum to set him up with it
Nah, by the time it’s fixed I’ll be back at school
And the lazy Mexicans(no offense digbo) took three weeks to fix the mold
And my mom’s place is infected with mold 
My dad’s house has no WiFi 
Yee
It’s been three weeks with no WiFi 
Lel
Especially in my time without an internet connection smh 
Your misconduct would result in punishment for everyone you are aquatinted with 
If I was president I would have you all executed for punning with my name 
It ain’t even good though 
And realized I couldn’t 
I tried so hard to find a good ending 
That game fucking triggers me
So I’ve only been able to play doki doki, unturned, and Minecraft this WHOLE FUCKING WEEK
I lost the power cord to my monitor than has hdmi here, so I’ve had to use a vga monitor which can’t run through my gpu
Also, do ya wanna know what’s worse than not having WiFi?
He is definitely a player
I agree 
Or does he respect women
Do y’all think Mr.Alvarado thinks “if she breaths, she a thot”? 
^^
I don’t have WiFi this week fam
Please allow Michael.chr to connect to the internet to execute team.exe

You a fucking horse Jett?
That’s basically like jerking off the businesses in your country  
I mean... come on fellas 
Is it gay to force suppliers to meet production quotas by subsidizing their industries?
 Fellas let’s be honest 
For the Plebs who haven’t watched this, learn how work makes you free and how to become Todd Howard
Did you guys know that Germany once committed an act of such contemptible evil, that the world still remembers them for it?
CYKA?
Yes
In theory? 
That is fucked up

There is nothing wrong with what my boy miles posted

The other appropriate responses are seize the means and destroy the means
Good answer parsa
Plz take my poll
He is trying to show the dangers of s2g conversion 
Varus went from being a perfectly heterosexual white male to a flaming queer with a man bow 
So
That a straight can go gay
And if that can happen, then he must believe the inverse is possible 
Pence believes gag conversion therapy can make a gay guy straight 
Hear me through

I feel like wolfenstein is meant to be played as a stealth game, like from a practical standpoint, you aren't superhuman or anything

If one answers any other question, they will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity and dropped from the course with a F mark. Furthermore, suicide is recommended.
It was the only answer to be picked

I like it because it simultaneously gives life a purpose and makes its purpose  futile
I call it: the Todd Howard Universal Release Regress
But time is sped up in each simulation compared to the previous one
That we are in a computer simulation made by other much more advanced humans for the soul purpose of discovering the correct theory of the universe. But the plot twist is that our creators are also a simulation made to discover truths about the universe 
You know what my favorite theory of the universe is?
soon tm
Germany knows two things, farming and extermination. Although they are hand in hand
buy farm simulator instead of elex Miles

Green Eggs and Ham Rap is a masterpiece about the bourgeoisie attempting to force capitalism unto glorious proletariat. But despite all the efforts of the filthy wardens of the means of production, the heroic working class stays true to their Marxist ideals

But digbo
I like looking like a molester tho
But should I shave my mustache for it?
So, I have a job interview today 
On 11/4/17, at 12:44 AM, Miles O'Brien wrote:
&gt; Almost as ridiculous as the new Mercedes Benz E-Class Sedan.
&gt; The most intelligent E-Class family of all time welcomes a powerful new member to the dynasty. The E400 Sedan model arrives this year, boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque — the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury.
&gt; Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips — even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. &quot;Car-to-X&quot; Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles — effectively allowing it to &quot;see&quot; around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems — including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC®, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist — feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them.
&gt; Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display, while touch controls, aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once. It's a vehicle that demands to be driven, and more than lives up to the dream.
&gt; Look for the E400 4MATIC Sedan at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter, with an MSRP of $58,900.
Trayvon Martin
what do you call a nigger who is triggered?
In the words of Milo Amoore, “REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE”.

bro, what don’t you understand

The problem with pushing tank jungles out is that this is adc meta 
He will suck in the new meta hopefully 
Not even close to true 
EZ jung is rampant 
There are way bigger problems than rammus 
But you shouldn't be rewarded for straight farming 
If you fail a game you should be punished definitely 
*ganks
Exactly, the cost of tanks are high, so the benefit should be equally as high
Junglers should be rewarded for ganking tho
SHAVE THE BUSH 
How bout Phreak just shaves the unkempt bush we call jungle and make the map one big lane 
Damn, what a shame 
She has a dick

Well, he sold us off his people for some guns a couple hundred years ago. I'm sure I could negotiate a trademark on black culture for a couple glass beads

Define cultural appropriation in such a retarded manner: taking elements of someone's culture without permission. Does that mean if one black person says it's okay I can wear blackface?

TEAM
^
And redistribute the wealth to let me get gold FASTER
And then chaos ensues so I can take the opportunity to seize the means of productions
I want no one to know what is going on
because it would be FUN
How can one say they have improved at anything when they cannot excel in a slightly different environment
Of course, but remade a core system of the game, that could justify, in this circumstance, relearning of mechanics
*more
I just wish they were moer radical
I realize that
Yet they are afraid to make us change our play styles??
They completely revamped the system
All I am saying is that if they didn't buff everyone, the net effect on the game would be the same
Just a little NuTtY
I mean it is retarded. Why take a system out of the game and then just give it back as base
Why didnt they buff mr for everyone?
but not everyone got the buff, mages didnt for example
Braum has 47 base
I mean, they buffed alistar and blitzes base armor by like 20
This season will be interesting
And zyra
If they think ADCs are too strong, they shouldn't buff armor of everyone else, just nerf base the ADCs. Otherwise mages will take over again, and no one likes that.
I hate how they try to manipulate the meta like that
So, why did they buff everyone's base armor by 10 or more
Who thinks Eric's taste in porn is gay?

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Hentai. The romance is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of tentacle physics most of the &quot;action&quot; will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the nuanced idea of feminimity, which is deftly woven into the visuals - the japanese philosophy of censorship really puts emphasis on imagination. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these ideas, to realize that they're not just erotic - they say something deep about human sexuality. As a consequence people who dislike Hentai truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the eye opening nature of watching Yaoi as a straight male, which only a true intellectual could appreciate without any form of arousal. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as a quintessential part of japanese culture unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a tentacle rape tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Monkey King Aghs upgrade: Monkey King's brilliant prowess in brewing allows him to open up his bar, called the Monkey King Bar. Any enemy hero in a nearby radius will give 1500 gold to the Monkey King because they will buy his beer and wine. They will also get a half duration Drunken Haze. If a hero can't afford it, they go into debt, granting Monkey King the Monkey King Bar effects on that specific hero until the next time Monkey King uses the ability and they can actually afford it.
It's an instant cast spell with an 800 radius. 100 second cooldown.
Note: Brewmaster pays double and does not get the Dunken Haze effect.
not gold 5
All ranked sucks
its like all the heaviest teammates just sink to the bottom of silver 5
silver 5 is the worse because it is filled with bronzes who got out of hell but still suck, so they cannot win games but, they also cannot get promoted
no no, rank 5 of any league is cancer
then i realized silver is worse to play in than bronze
I wanted to leave silver
they are just yacht dad clothes
That guy’s clothes are gay in that you know that he sucks cash out of his father’s trust fund like a cracked out man whore
that is litty
it worked holyshit
real shit?
I shleep
it is an hour north
and santa rosa aint gay
it was smokey here too
it is well within the employer's rights

“To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp;amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp;amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎”

same?
that doesn’t happen
It couldn’t have been one
Only downside of traps is they don’t have slutholes tho
That is the sweetest thing I’ve ever read
fair enough digbo
They can still have good asses tho, gimme that and we are good 
Call me whatever you want as long as I'm getting some Gucci ass 
👌👌

I mean ofc it's gay to fuck a guy, but if you were doing a hot or not thing, and you saw a girl that was actually a guy and you said they hot, it wouldn't be really gay
But thinking a trap is hot isn’t
Yes
But think of it like schrodinger’s cat, if you don’t know if someone is a man or a woman, but they look like a hot woman, is it gay?
You are welcome, I’ve done my studies
exactly
Not an attractive girl really
This guy to me personally looks more like a girl
How about this
that guy is hardly wearing any makeup
no no
All I’m saying is that guys can look like girls, naturally or with makeup
If he had a soft voice or something idk
That is a guy that is androgynous, you could be “trapped” by him
or even an androgynous guy
think of drag queens or something, those are traps
Is id smash
All I’m saying
*ftm
like fem?
wait what?
I coulda counted as a trap (aka crossdresser)
Like, my girlfriend wanted to do my makeup once, if i had some leggings i woulda been a smoking hot bitch
But being a trap takes no commitment
*shemale
shamble isn’t really appropriate
By traps i believe we are referring to crossdressers. If one takes permanent action towards gender reassignment then you have a trans woman
but i mean, women have small tits too sometimes

You may be rich now, but if you end up spending money like you are discussing here, you will not be for long.
in vegas
for a very nice room
220 a night
to sleep
why waste money on an expensive ass room
But you aint even in the room most of the time on vacation
Some people legitimately cannot afford that, and others do not like wasting money
That aint a normal hotel room
For a suite…
true, I’m just triggered by inaccuracies
A good room at a nice hotel is 300
what hotel are you going too that is 500 a night!!
Learn how money works my dude
We stayed at Marriot’s and Hyatts for half the trip and some other hotels that weren’t as fancy
...
I vacationed Europe for two weeks with my dad, and that cost $10k total. Minimum three star hotels and good food the whole time, vacations do not start at 10k
ill need to get rid of my current one then
digbo, send that photo full size, its cute

I saw Shannon today on a red motor scooter, and i thought it was a spicy meme
but that aint why i summoned B[]eter

hey [B]eter
What&#x27;s the plan?
Hey ni🅱🅱as
Hey 🅱eter
Fucking 🅱eadass
Alright, blind in bound
I&#x27;ll start blining over
Understandable
Understandable, I just don&#x27;t wanna be too late famalia
I was waiting on my phone to charge a little
Alright, who is at the hizzle?
When is place?
But it wasn&#x27;t filtered, was only fermenting for a day, and was warm
I tried a little yesterday
Do y&#x27;all want kvass?
I was dreaming of memes while you were still in yo dads balls
Yes ni🅱🅱🅱a?
Your computer is gay, it can&#x27;t get bareback gay porn out of its memory ;^)
And parsa is gonna have some of my kvass
Michael was a simple man. A man of kvass, kompot, and the Gulag. He spent his days bothering his Babushka to make him Blins and Chebureki after long nights of hardbass and vodka. A man of few words, all he uttered was &quot;CYKA BLYAT&quot; as he spat semechki at pedestrians. He lived as he died, a cheeki breeki gopnik. 
That&#x27;ll be my eulogy btw
Basically homemade beer my dude
Miles understands
Well, technically they are now grapes
Those are raisins
No, kvass
It&#x27;s what this rock is cooking

i wish to play legus
hey boys
I&#x27;m more shook than a feminist at a strip club
Then guess and get that concept right
You know that feel when you forget an integral concept for a class during the final that is in every question
Hopefully I wont smell like death during my final
I just sprayed myself with febreeze
*spinner
as it should, but did the vape, the spiner, or the music give me cancer?
i smell like a homeless
and no
I thought we moved from team
You might find it shocking
watch that vid babies
Observe fags
Also yes i do
I read a study that smoking once is as likely o cause cancer as smoking for years. I hope that is true but i doubt it
i agree
I just wish i had pizza to vape on
instead of studying for my final in an hour, I'm listening to pink season and vaping
but i don't know anything about economics
and im pretty good at economics
E C O N O M I C S final today
but first I have to go through hell

INVITE MEH NEXT GAME FIGGETS
the nigger patch?
you cant beat free housing
idk what I want to do, maybe ill just stay with my parents for a while
ye true
like id settle for 50k maybe even 45 a year instead of 60 or more here at first, because rent would be like 500 a month
with a good degree, it cant be that bad, at least the ratio of housing cost to pay will be much lower than here regardless
like, this place would be dope af
a lake or something, maybe a river
id like to live on water
I wouldn't live in texas, too hot
kappa
bc you absorb light better
I would rather live in the snow than the heat
i love the cold and rain tf
lol
^
You dont need socal to be happy
literally tho
colarodo sounds like a venereal disease
As long as it aint hot
ooh oregon would be nice
You can buy a mansion for 300k
I was thinking of moving to Michigan eventually
kappa
uh
The cheapest house in Pensylvania is $30k, the median pay is $50k. The cheapest house in santa monica is over 1 mill and the median pay is $72k
you don't even need college
I would also like to point out that in other parts of the country, you dont need 6 years of grad school to buy a house
300k or more??
cyka blyat do you not understand how to buy houses
the mortgage is the loan
you have to have a downpayment
Thats called a mortgage dummy
The downpayment on a 1.5 mil house is, lets see, 300k
No one can start off owning a place unless their parents pay for it
And why woukldnt they hire someone who has worked for 10 years?
how many new marketing majors do you think google needs every year?
not everyone is a cs major...
also
and they are al very hard to get hired for
I am pretty sure one is moer liekly to become a pro footballer than to work for google out of college
Not everone works for outlandishly rich tech firms
thats google
i mean super rich
no
Bc they are either rich beforehand, or bought 20 years ago
You cant own a house with a well paying job
To rent you can live here
Not to own a house
because id like to own a house someday?
^ why I want to move away
jesus shit, 8k for a one bedroom
the only problem I have with it is that after a year of rent in santa monica, at $3k, youd be half way to an average house basically anywhere else in the country
average is like $2k
yea, its insane, even west Hollywood is high
i thought 400 was low lol
those previous ones were condos
There are NO houses for sale uner $1 million
wait sorry I lied
there are 13 houses for sale under $750k
There is no house in santa monica worth under $400k
everywhere in santa monica is expensive my dudes
I thought stopmasturbationnow.org was real for about a tenth of a second
Masturbation is a gateway drug to rape. It also leads to sexual dysfunction, erodes family values, and is a top ten cause of disease.

You don't know how fucking wrong you are. Fidget spinners were designed for elite athletes, CEOs, and arch-bishops. Kids merely adopted the spinning, we were born in it, moulded by it. I've dedicated my life to fidget spinners. I'm the only truly certified grand master of fidget spinners; 3 time defending world champion WWE belt holder of fidget spinning. So I believe I'm the only one truly qualified to tell you that fidget spinning is a man's sport, a man's man's sport. I was once a boy who became a man thanks to fidget spinning and also natural ageing. Do you wanna know the difference between me and a child? I'm 22 fucking years old, children are usually under 12 depending on what criteria you're gonna use to classify someone as a child so think about that shit next time you see me torpedoing down a slip-and-slide sailing at an atom splitting 68 miles per hour going straight into a fucking brick wall of manliness. How do I stay in top physical form becoming this athletic specimen that scientists can't even fully understand? Well it's all thanks to my work out and diet regimen now it'd make even LeBron James shit his pants. I wake up at 4 am everyday , I drink 3 raw eggs with the side of pancakes with nails sprinkled on top and also a glass of straight uranium, I then grab my favourite fidget spinner: the triple XL gold-plated 25 pound weighted Air-Cutter supreme-extreme maximum turbo overdrive spagooter with pump-action assault-grip as well as extended magazines and a silencer, I've even customised this bad boy with a laser dot sight with a green finish as well as further modifications including hydraulics, 3D printing capability as well as doubling as a fax machine. This is a gadget straight out of MI6, this is right brewed up from fucking Q laboratories- he used to make gadgets for 007 now he's making fidget spinners for me. Do you still think this is a fad for kids you fucking troglodyte? Well I guess if that's how you wanna spin this story, but for me I know the truth, I know that this game was made for men and I've mastered it. I live and breathe fidget spinning. So go ahead, play your boring traditional sports like football and baseball. I'll just be here like a diss-jockey spinning it. Hugh! Sorry about that, just had to dodge another vagina that was just tossed at me, it's not easy being the grand master of fidget spinning.<legacyquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;</legacyquote></quote>

and i need something other than nicotine and Arabic tea to keep me up
because i have a whole nother essay to write
it wasn't a good idea, it was one of those sour ice breakers
jesus we are in agreement xd
oh bless
I regretted that immediately
Let the records show
should I snort an icebreaker?
goddamn jiggaboos
niggers are damned
yep

Oh yes, these memes are quite glorious, I already know youses addresses tho
BLYAT
IS CYKA
YOU SAY CKYA, CKYA IS NOTHING
IS CYKA
WESTERN SPY
Nazi mods
My anus is not here
Niggers run on the plain
Dial one to meme
Have a Hyku instead
As much as I want to, I am unable to at the moment
Only true gopniks get that one
That&#x27;s in the rules
The chat is never to be called
Imma fucking bust a nut
Oh so it&#x27;s okay when you niggers call chat but when I wanna play league it ain&#x27;t
WHO TH TUCK CALLED
I&#x27;m pretty good at chemistry
Deh
None of that matters
Apologies fellas, let&#x27;s 🅱et to work
Please say apologies fellas please say apologies fellas please say apologies fellas
PLEASE
Hollup 🅱arsa, where your coat at
We going on 🅱atrol?
Hey 🅱iles
And then we are all suicidal
And then I have to share my anger with y&#x27;all
Bc it pisses me off
THIS IS WHY YOU MUST STOP ME FROM READING SNAPCHAT
Wanting to date someone who has a brain is normal I assume, unless you like bimbos
They act like connecting with someone over wit and intelligence is part of a sexuality
😂😂
You like smart people
This is retarded
You guys need to stop me from reading snapchat news
Salt my dish bartender
no 3-0
even i don't like myself that much
wait, are you assuming I voted for myself?
so turn off notifications, or we can agree as a chat not to spam
why are you arguing over the logical basis of spam?
breaking skype is funny
Because its a meme
Your statement is correct. People have to be told not to do things they enjoy.
If long term bans were the punishment of spamming, then spam wouldnt happen.
Only strong discouragement
There are no rules against spam.
David, quit acting like Parsa
Excuse me?
sowwy
that's me
all good
i only sent like 20 photos on my end but it glitch
its actually interesting
wait, sorry, a mini bomb is about to go off

Y’all wanna camp next week
We camping? 
xdd
Did you kill DANCER FIRST?
Oooh 
I’m stuck on Gael 
About me being right
Miles is right
And god forbid I run into a wall by accident, it would take me 40 years to regain the fortitude to begin motion once more 
The controls feel like I’m stroking 5 dicks at once to move my character 
False 
3 is just better 
I mean
K a p p a 
And the hit boxes seem less forgiving 
I think it’s just inherent to the system, I just need to adjust 
Idk
Nah it’s just engine lag I believe 
<ss type="sad">:(</ss> 
It just feels sloppy compared to 3 
The controls make me sad 
Why does dark souls remastered feel so bad <ss type="sad">:(</ss> 
We dropping? 
Si 
you should HAVE AIMED FOR MY BALLS
your BIG BLUE BALLS
that thing
hand it over
youre still here?
huh
Thank you Kanye! Very cool
uhh glamping
but on the other hand
nigga I gotta work out
X D
I’m pretty down tho 
Damn 
They removed dark souls prepare to die from the steam store 
Waaaaait 
If by HoTS you mean dark souls 3 deprived multiplayer... still no, but soon 
Ah understandable 
That is a nigger move
This chat is to be used for comedic quandaries regarding camping with the boys, Dark Souls theory and lore, commentary on the state of League, catalyzing the occurrence of deceasement, and the occasional affirmation that traps are not gay. 
Perhaps you've seen it, maybe while blazing.
A dank, forgotten land.
A place where memes may mend your ailing mind.
You will lose everything...
... once Retarded
The symbol of the autistic.
An augur of darkness.
Your past. Your future. Your very light.
None will have meaning, and you won't even ask if this is loss.
By then, you'll be something other than human.
A thing that feeds on McDonalds.
A Cuck.
Long ago, in a walled off chat, far to the downs, a great fiend built a great society.
I believe they called it [B]onfire.
Perhaps you're familiar.
No, how could you be.
But one day, you will jerk off before its decrepit text.
Without really knowing why...
Like a Philip drawn to a edibles.
Your mind will burn in anguish.
Time after time.
For that is your fate.
The fate of the gaming ninja.
The hyperbolic nature of his statement confuses me, my emotions are confounded and my day is ruined. 
? 
Understandable 
Because I’m on ng+ for my first Gael 
But I also did myself no favors 
Is it three times per game or three times total? 
Because I wasted too much on faith that’s kinda useless 
I think I just need to farm a couple more levels to get some more endurance 
Yeah and that’s the kind that fucks me over the most 
Don’t want to git gud 
I really 
Did you beat Gael? 
Dark souls 3 remastered 2025???
I just really like the dark souls universe, and it kinda feels like a waste of time examining it if I can’t apply that to anything in the future 
I wish there was more than 3 <ss type="sad">:(</ss> 
Oh
No sun bros? 
Even though it’s garbage 
Seems pretty good 
Which honestly 
Dark souls 2 is ten bucks 
And so it is<e_m a="michaelbatemanshirley" ts_ms="1531031753426" ts="1531031753" t="61"></e_m>
And so it id
Return the lords to their thrones 
Please, unkindled one
Milo it’s too late 
BATTLE ROYAL IS THE AGE OF DARKNESS 
THE FIRE WILL FADE EVENTUALLY THOUGH AND THE AGE OF DARKNESS WILL ARRIVE 
We are ONLY ARTIFICIALLY EXTENDING THE AGE OF FIRE 
Is just a rekindling of the fire 
Each season 
Wait 
Yeaaaah 
 I guess the philosophy was made to make the game seem fresh 
I mean 
Yeah 
I don’t think league can unfuckup 
Unless they release battleroyal modes 
Too bad league and HoTS are gonna be gone in three months 
Soon™️
We get lit 
Therefore 
It must become deceased soon
Good news miles 
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little &quot;clever&quot; comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
...
Now that is incomprehensible

Yes indeed, it is called the Angeles National Forest In the transitory lands where the counties converge. In traveling North, the dickheads find the truth of the old word. “The flame fades and the fools go without tokes”. When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls unearthing the old lords from their graves. Milo, saint of procrastination. David’s autistic legion, the pepe watchers. And the reclusive alpha of the profaned city, Digbo the big. Only in truth will the chucks abandon their bongs, and the unkindled will rise. Shameless, despacitoless, monkeys, not even fit to be camping. And so it is that autism seeketh camping

In return, I’ll give you the privilege of being able to say “gosh” or “golly” seriously. Furthermore, I’ll give you the the ability to be guilty for the 6 million. It seems like a fair trade to me 
Mars, can we be named honorary negri for our appreciation of ethnic culture? I don’t want anyone to call me racist when I blast Gambino’s new banger 
bash each other's heads in with pool noodles

Yes indeed, it is called camping. Where the transitory lands of the lords of forest converge. In venturing to the LA forest the pilgrims discover the truth of the old word:”the bong dies and the Lords go without tokes”. When the link of the bowl is threatened the bell tolls unearthing the old lords of retards from their graves. Mars saint of the deep tokes. Milo’s Savage legion: the Goat watchers. And the boosted lord of the society which he lives in Miles the giant. Only in truth the lords will abandon their bongs and the homunculi will rise. Domeless retarded subhuman unfit even to pick cotton. And so it is that eeeeee seeketh reeeee

I’d shave my whole body for that shit 
But I mean, $200 an hour is decent 
That is a hard part, without my pedostashe, what would I be? 
I’d do anal too, that’s where the money is at 
And like closeted married dudes 
Dude there are tons of fags 
Other than sucking dick and selling drugsv
That’s more than I could make doing most other things 
I agree 
Hell yeah 
Would i get a straw cap and burlap shorts? 
I’d work in a field for less 
Mars, we can go really hard r right? 
Can I split that with you miles? 
Wait 
Wtf me and your mama isn’t rock 
So it’s definitely weird 
In me and your mama he is basically screaming the whole time 
A little faggotry never hurt 
But skip to like 2 minutes if you want to get immediately erect 
Listen to me and your mama 
It’s like Rockstar for me, because the memes that song has generated make it v nice 
And sober is pretty good 
Me and your Mama makes my peepee hard
