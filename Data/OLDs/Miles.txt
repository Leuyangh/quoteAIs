Politics
Yes.
GabeN reads the email.

Politely responds with &quot;Nice.&quot; and clicks send

He then immediately picks up the phone and summons Icefrog to his office.

&quot;What the fuck is the meaning of this?&quot; he says, angrily pointing at the email. &quot;Why the fuck are people still picking the hero. I thought I told you to dumpster it&quot;

&quot;I-I know but I can't simply just do that. You know what they say, &quot; Icefrog says with a sheepish grin to try to lighten the mood, &quot;Balance in all thi-&quot;

Before Icefrog can finish his sentence, GabeN stands up with a boom and backhands Icefrog, completely obliterating his head, leaving only his lower jaw still attached to the neck.

Icefrog's body remains standing for a few seconds before crumpling to the floor

GabeN sits back down in his chair and pinches the brow between his eyes while letting out an exasperated sigh.

...

Elsewhere, deep below Valve HQ, machinery suddenly begins to rumble to life. What once was pitch black room is now dimly illuminated from the glow of a single human-sized test tube, just one of hundreds, all organized in neat rows. Inside the tube is a human suspended in some sort of liquid. Without warning the person awakes in horror and begins to flail around helplessly while gasping for air. Seemingly in response, the liquid begins to drain from the tube, leaving the person inside crumpled on the ground, just barely alive. The tube then silently retracts into the floor.

Overhead, a speaker crackles briefly before GabeN's voice can be heard.

I'm also on good terms with the professor who runs this class, so its good
and explain to them that he literally just did the presentation today, after I showed him mine, hence its remarkable similarity <ss type="surprised">:O</ss>
which i just made him do
so if I'm accused of plaigerism my ass is covered because I'll show them what he had initially done before I made him reformat our shared presentation
I have a copy of the thing he sent before he changes anything
Its all good though
I have not, because we dont have a TA xd
but i gotta deal with him for another week, so I cant just make one of my group members into an enemy
see, if this was the last time i would have to work with him I would do that 
xddddddddddddddddddddd
yeah, this is uh, kind of a big oof for me chief
after further review, he almost verbatim copied what i put on my slides and just slightly changed the words
the kiss of death im telling you
its incredible
he essentially copied my exact format for my slides and then autistically posted his slides after mine instead of trying to intermesh our slides and not repeat the information that I already had in mine
we have a power point presentation due tomorrow

Hello, I'm a salesman sorta giant
I sell molly and mary and other various items
One time one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding

[Verse 2]
Task force poured into my fortress
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms
They found a couple portraits on the porch
But they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shawty
Hit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red, piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin cotton leather and wool
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake cause its good, I mean I would if I could
But I like playing dress up and mix match
Sorry I'mma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back

 We never paid any heed to the ancient prophecies. Like fools we clung to the old hatreds, and fought as we had for generations. Until the day the sky rained fire, and a new enemy came upon us. We stand now, upon the brink of destruction, for the reign of chaos has come at last.

i was talking about the coca plant, not the cacao plant or coffee bush

He just sat there with his teeth in his mouth, and asked if the lab was all we had to do
It’s in humane and egregious 
That’s just wrong
But one of the absolute worst offenses in my book is someone who doesn’t assist in the lab clean up

I knew I was dealing with an autistic, oblivious sperg at that very moment
So naturally I ask him what he plays
And of course he says yeah I’m a pc master race all the way

now heres the remix
Okay. So, I’ve been seeing this copypasta floating around about wanting to “bang Dark Willow”, and frankly- I think this is disgusting. First of all, her name isn’t “Dark Willow”, it’s Mireska. It’s a beautiful name for a beautiful person, and you would all do well to refer to her as such. If you don’t even know her name, than you have no right wanted to have sex with her!

Secondly, wanting to bang her is just gross. Saying that you want to bang Mireska is objectifying her, and it is not okay. If you’ve ever wanted to bang Mireska, you should be disgusted with yourself.

Unlike you cretins, I however- respect her. Sure, it’s possible I may consider her to be rather bangable, but I wouldn’t dare do such a thing. Mireska is a fucking queen, and deserves to be treated as such.

I DO NOT want to bang “Dark Willow&quot;. I want to hug her. I want to be in a healthy and loving relationship with Mireska. I want to wake up every morning in bed, with her lying peacefully next to me as the morning sun shines in through the window. I want to make her breakfast every morning, and tend to her every need. I want her to feel like she is truly loved, (because she is). I want her to be by my side for my whole life, because I know that she is the perfect woman for me, and I am perfect for her.

I want to be to be with her every day, just so I can tell her how much I fucking love her. I want her to know how much I adore everything amazing personality, her incredible fashion sense, her extremely impressive caretaking abilities, and her absolutely beautiful wing to body ratio, and her beautiful, beautiful eyes.

However, if I were to ever have sex with Mireska, wouldn’t simply be “banging” her. If Mireska were to ever consent to me having sexual intercourse with her, it would be tender and loving and passionate. As we make love, I’d slowly and gently caress her soft, fluffy wings as I slowly but deliberately thrusted into her tight wooden pussy. I would make her pleasure my utmost priority, with my own being secondary. But if she was willing, than oh god. What I wouldn’t give to feel her adorable little antennas running up and down the length of my shaft. I just wanna pet every inch of her body, and give her scritches on her tummy so she does that thing that fairies do where their wings spaz out. That’d just be so fucking hot. I’d probably end up cumming all over her, so it gets on her wings. But goddamn. I love those wings wo much, that I’d personally lick off every last drop of cum, just to I have another opportunity to get as close to her gorgeous wings as possible.

But if you just want to bang her, than you are a disgusting degenerate, and I hope you burn in the deepest pits of tartarus.

Alright its decided

On jah?
real negus shit?

Ya like jazz?
Word
  Truly a blessed gentleman
It's 4 AM, November 26th, 2019. You're tossing and turning in your Dolce &amp; Gabbana sheets. Haven't slept a wink. Maybe it's the chains? You could have taken them off before bed, of course, but Jeeves is on holiday, and what kind of peasant dresses themselves? You make a mental note to browse for better sleeping chains when you get into the office. Maybe white gold rather than platinum; it'll catch less of the light from the diamond chandeliers.

NO! Bad employee! Goofing around online is what got you into this mess in the first place. Giving the Dota player-base a hard release date for the Outlanders patch, what were you thinking? Fuck, fuck, fuck. That was weeks ago and all you've done since then is try to teach the office monkey how to play Artifact. There's one project that was a little too successful; you haven't won a game in weeks. Make a mental note to browse for an importer who sells less capable chimps. Is there a monkey indigenous to NA?

You get up; there's no point trying to sleep any more. Might as well face the music. You swing open the French windows and the string quartet in the courtyard below dutifully begins to play Beethoven's 4th. Personally you prefer his 4-1th but the big guy banned it years ago.

You wash up in the infinity pool, because you read a Forbes article that said a statistically significant percentage of millionaires die in the shower, and as a Valve employee you know that all statistics are to be taken very seriously except for the player count of your games. You dress in a modest three-piece of embroidered gold and, as it's a nice day, decide to give the chauffeur a break and walk to the helipad instead.

The anxiety is rising as you approach Bellvue HQ. This is almost certainly going to be your last day. The big patch that everyone's expecting doesn't exist. Despite Valve putting a record number of people on the Dota 2 team, no progress has been made by either of you. Reddit is going to freak out and the big guy is going to bring out the special branding iron for asses he doesn't want to work with again. Shit, fuck, shit.

You slink into the office with heavy heart. As you pass the big guy's room you can hear he's playing Sand King again. 'Fuck this Morph-Shaker bullshit!', comes a low growl from within. 'New patch when, me?!' You feel a weight like a bowling ball settle in your stomach.

You sit down at the workstation, trying not to draw any attention. Opening up the patch project directory, which you know is going to be empty, you almost fall out of your chair. There must be at least 80 gigs of assets and code in here across hundreds of files! You notice the names 'Snapfire' and 'Vspirit', which vaguely remind you of something, back in September, that Bruno rudely kept trying to tell you about during an important game of beer pong.

Who did this? What happened here?

With a growing sense of confidence, you realise you must have done this. That week you spent on an absinthe bender with that new hire, was it Katy or Casey? Whatever her name was, she sure knew how to party. You thought you'd spent it staring at your hands in the company aquarium and trying to barf the alphabet, but now you realise you must have been coding up a storm during all those blackouts!

You sense a presence behind you, and looking up, you notice Julio, the janitor. He has huge bags under his bloodshot eyes and the posture of an exhausted man.

'Jesus, you look like shit,' you say.

'No, señor, my name is Julio', he replies.

'I didn't mean - sorry, Julio. Wait, weren't you here when I left last night?'

'Si, señor. '

'What have you been doing all this time?'

'Oh, this and that.' He smiles ruefully as he says this.

Well, enough chit-chat. You tap the button conveniently marked 'upload patch' and lean back in your chair. Another yearly bonus well earned.

We don't know what AI wants
Also, one thing to point out, we are assuming AI wants what we think it wants
^ pretty much
I think we should expand our thinking if we think AI means the end of all meaningful work
AI would be very useful
I don't think we should stop development of AI

That feel when you literally go &quot;I sleep&quot; while you're mid way through an argument feelsgoodman
human need job because human have feeling, computer no feel, computer no need job
Exactly, which is why it’s worth convincing them to change their minds
Those people are disfranchised and vote for someone who will listen to them 
You’re right, and you know why trump won right?
I’m not advocating for any of those things
Which is investment
Sunk cost was a bad euphemism for what I was really trying to get at
You don’t seem to get it, they’re already alive, their existence is an investment given the resources they took up to be raised, it’s wasteful to throw that away by saying they’re screwed and they need to figure things out for themselves<e_m a="live:miles.cal" ts_ms="1571027314250" ts="1571027314" t="61"></e_m>

And not productive 
Just telling them to fuck off and die is profoundly wasteful
No one said we need the people, but the fact of the matter is they exist and we need to make them useful regardless of how automation affects them
So they could contribute, we just need to figure out how
That maybe be because we don’t know how to maximally exploit their abilities just yet
Because people would literally be dying in droves
And you would know if it was
The earth isn’t overpopulated

Miyazaki: Oh, dear, another dogged contender. Welcome, fanboy, purloiner of Elden Ring. Mind you, the release date interests me none. The gameplay trailer, the gamescon presentation, let it all fade into nothing. You've done quite enough, now have your Bloodborne Kart.

DOTA PLUS UPDATE MEGA POG
its true
Axe is Ricardo Milos
ogre magi is shrek
that's who dat be
yeee
like Witch Doctor with a Caprisun and Gun
for the tournament xd
and certain heroes have custom models
and the items are a little different and autistic
also the map has all this meme shit covering it and its like a deep fried meme
then rosh attacks normally I think
xd
and the roshan is controlled by someone wearing a VR headset and he attacks as fast as the person can punch
they let players control certain creeps
the player controlled creeps and VR roshan are pretty dank memes
midas mode is actually pretty hype

GABEN ANNOUNCES OPENING OF MIDAS MODE

Ah, a fellow fat baby 
A negus really out here furrifying
Damb
Very understandable 
What distinguishes the genders
Xd
I like to think I was born late because I understood that being a baby was kind of the ideal state of being
Yeah they’re pretty good
It’s true
And a bit dried out 
So they had to induce labor, and at that point I was probably a bit overdeveloped for a new born baby so I was around 10 lbs when I was born
So basically I was overdue, and that wouldn’t have been a problem if I wasn’t so overdue because at that point the amniotic fluid was beginning to dry up
Alright
I’ll regale you with the tale of my birth
Thanking you vros
Xddddddddddddddddd
Vros...thanking you

It's the year 2034

TI24 has just concluded with Ice (Malaysia), Iceice (China), Iceiceice (Singapore), and breakout duo Iceiceiceice (New Zealand) + Iceiceiceiceice (Ghana) being crowned this year's TI champions. They are the first team to finally beat OG in the finals, ending OG's TI winstreak which started at TI8.

Dota is mostly the same game as it always has been, except for the addition of voice commands into the game, which has made keyboards obsolete. Players now shout spell and item usage at their computers, creating an advantage for players who can speak at a rapid pace. Most notably, ODPixel and Sheever's daughter is quickly rising as one of the most sought-after players in the world, after having picked up her father's insane speech pacing. Renowned for being the world's best Invoker combo reciter, she can recite the full tornado &gt; deafening blast &gt; meteor combo a full second faster than the second fastest player, Miracle Jr.

The scene is thriving and healthy. T2/T3 teams are sustainably supported. Seasonal payouts are more equitably distributed, with TI still being Dota's annual culminating event. Gender and regional representation in the scene is rich and diverse. And of course, Purge transcended this mortal realm to become a celestial intelligence that brings the gift of Dota 2 to other worlds. SirActionSlacks has also transcended, and now exists as a sentient pair of Slacks, holding a position at Valve as the Executive Entertainment Officer for all Dota events.

See you all at TI25!

Yang Gang
After a long day of work and college, you are finally free of your obligations. It’s Friday and you have the whole night for yourself! After doing some exercises, taking a very nice shower and having a delicious meal, you look at your computer and say

– Time for DOTO –

Banning phase is over and you see people fighting over mid and HC. You decide to be a teamplayer and first pick a support. CM is nice and you have her arcana. Morale rises up and everyone picks accordingly. Seems like you might have a nice game after all. You see the enemy team. It seems mid will be their last pick. “What hero will they pick? you wonder”.

Invoker perhaps? Annoying pick, but you can deal with him.

What about Lina? Niche pick, but seems like a decente hero for their team.

Maybe mid Pudge lol? You joke to yourself.

After giving a quick check to the banned heroes, you see that the “hero” you tried to ban wasn’t banned...

Time comes to a halt. Everything goes silent. Your room loses all the color. Everything around you seems devoid of life with the exception of the monitor screen.

3 seconds left. They still haven’t picked.

-M-maybe they will just go for Invoker.

2 seconds left.

-Lina?

1 second left;

-haha they will just throw and pick Pudge.

It’s already -2 seconds and they still haven’t picked. Maybe they will just get an abandon and you will be saf...

TINKER!

You stare at the screen, but you are not sure you are really there. It's all over...

This is Joe reacting to the idea
If you think about it Chimps don't have access to the best training regimens and nutrition, so we haven't seen them in the best physical condition, but the truly crazy thing is we haven't seen chimps do any kind of MMA, and the even crazier thing is we haven't seen Chimps on DMT in peak physical condition do MMA

Yeah, I got all skills
But I wanted to see how much of a difference saving all your skill points for attack power conversion would make
Not that I didn't have any skills though
Like I killed the Divine dragon in 4 lightning strikes instead of the usual 7-8<e_m a="live:miles.cal" ts_ms="1557626622737" ts="1557626622" t="61"></e_m>

It doesn't scale incredibly well, but any damage more than what the dev's anticipate you'll have at that point in the game gives you a significant advantage
especially with confetti and yasharikus sugar
and that is way more than enough to utterly cheese any endgame enemies
which means youll have about 20-22 attack power atleast
which is on top of the attack power you get from bosses
Which becomes 10 attack power
But if you clear the game without dying too much, you get about 50 skill points by the time you reach Fountainhead

I killed Sword saint in like less than a minute
Hesitation is defeat btw
in Sekiro
Not spending any skill points on skills and saving it all for end game to convert into attack power is fairly legit
So uh, my experiment has come to fruition and the data is out

You cheated not only the game, but yourself. You didn't grow. You didn't improve. You took a shortcut and gained nothing. You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained. It's sad that you don't know the difference.

This is discrimination 
I know I'm morbid at times
That's how I like to be
They call my dick a mammoth
You're salty you got a micro-d
Classic penis joke
Inserted with appropriate timing
Because if I ain't got a penis line
I ain't dining

Perhaps
That gay men are in fact the superior male, primarily due to the fact they do not rely upon women
I have a theory
Ye
also using that mod that removes spirit emblem costs xddddddd
It didn’t change the mortal blade weapon art ranges, it changed muh base weapon range
I replaced mortal blade with ludwigs holy blade and it actually extended the attack range because it uses the attack range from BloodBorne
that replaces kusabimaru
the mortal blade one
That feel when you gotta get rid of the kusabimaru mod, but then replace it with a mod that inadvertently buffs it by extending the attack range feelsgoodman

Did you know that Sekiro is actually in the same universe as Bloodborne? When getting the Frozen Dragon Tear for the hidden ending the child mentions that the dragon blood does NOT originate from this land and that it comes from the &quot;west&quot;. By this we can deduce that the dragons blood is actually the paleblood from Bloodbonre, making these games the same 
In Sekiro : Shadows Die Twice, you play as Nero, Guts of Rivia (a.k.a Big Boss). 
After losing everything and getting your arm chopped by your enemy you must attach a bunch of custom gadgets to fight otherworldly bosses.

So yesterday, I was talking with Danech when I saw this petite blonde white girl walking with this tall black dude. Understanding the comedy of this sighting I told Danech to look behind him. He immediately whips around faster than the speed of sound, looks right at the girl who looks back at him and lets out an enormous laugh that alerts everyone in a 100 mile radius that he just found something funny. My enjoyment was immeasureable and my day complete.

and then you find a portal that leads to Demon Souls
and then find the original painting that leads back to dark souls

with some fromsoftware embellishment of course
But I think they are going to literally do an overexaggerated version of what actually happened to the Ashina clan
who is also an actual figure from the sengoku period
and immortal hanbei
and the evil commander of the ashina
and your waifu healer
and a sculptor
and there is sekiro and his lord
All we know for a fact is that its set in the sengoku period and the Ashina clan is involved
That's not what the game says
that is related to the ashina clan
but that its an interpretation of actual history
Not that its soulsborne
Given that the knight is there
I think my theory will be correct

When fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight. Sun tzu said that. And I think he knows a little more about fighting than you do pal, because he invented it, and then he perfected it so that no living man could best him in the ring of honour. Then he used his fight money to buy two of every animal on earth. Then he herded them onto a boat, and then he beat the crap out of every single one of them. And from that day on, anytime a bunch of animals are in one place, it’s called a zoo! Unless it’s a farm!﻿

small brain: Jojo is gay
awakened brain: JoJo is manly.
exploding brain: JoJo is very campy, but not literally gay. If anything, it presents a non-standard view of masculinity that allows straight men to identify with it while feeling able to embrace the queerish elements of its style. Things like high fashion, that are often seen as somewhat metrosexual for men to be into, are normalized by no character ever commenting on another's appearance in regards to sheer strangeness or &quot;gayness&quot;. Likewise, just about anyone can appreciate this show because the campy elements do not define it, and its writing holds up on its own alongside the excellent art of the manga and superb quality of the adaptation by David Productions. If a viewer/reader came to JoJo for its campy elements, they can fully enjoy them while getting a great story with memorable and likable characters, while if they didn't they'd still get the story and characters anyway.

I must summon david back to the fiesta
I just add something to blow your mind, Jotaro's stand &quot;Star Platinum&quot; 
is actually Jonathan Joestar, ok lets go to the facts, the whole plot of
 JoJo series is about bloodline, and the original concept was to make 
the series in 3 parts culminating in &quot;Stardust crusaders&quot;, &quot;Star 
platinum&quot; refers to the mark branded by every JoJo and it wears same 
clothes pieces and colors like Jonathan, their similar atacks like &quot;star
 finger&quot; (jonathan's Zoom Punchh) and &quot;ora punches&quot; (sunlight 
overdrive), despite Dio whe got Jonathan's body is Jotaro who carry his 
Soul, The Star Platinum, and that's why Joseph doesn't have a proper Stand also, cuz he wasn't meant to fight Dio, 
 and that's why both Star Platinum and The World 
shares the same type and even same ability (Time stop) and you can think
 that &quot;The world&quot; represents the phisical entity (body) and &quot;The star&quot; 
represents the metaphorical entity (soul) and to finish with golden key,
 in the first part of JoJo, Jonathan's say &quot;If i die, my soul will haunt
 you&quot; and we know that Jonathan is a man of word, he keeps his promisses
 no matter the cost.

to step up your monster hunter world game
this is for you milo
Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream.
A murky, forgotten land.
A place where traps may mend your ailing mind.
You will lose everything...
... once Branded.
The symbol of the curse.
An augur of darkness.
Your past. Your future. Your very light.
None will have meaning, and you won't even care.
By then, you'll be something other than human.
A thing that feeds on traps.
A Faggot.
Long ago, in a walled off land, far to the north, a great king built a great kingdom.
I believe they called it Drangleic.
Perhaps you're familiar.
No, how could you be.
But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate.
Without really knowing why...
Like a moth drawn to a flame.
Your wings will burn in anguish.
Time after time.
For that is your fate.
The fate of the cursed.
A revelation?

The Venator Files 1: Inquisitor Veros's Records, Acolyte Cell █-█; Entries 1-2 (Dark Heresy 2nd Ed.)
Long
Acolyte Cell █-█;
Entry 1: New Cell Composition
Date: 6.███.99█.M41
Inquisitor ████████ Veros

I have assembled a new acolyte cell on the hive world of Setroma, consisting of the following individuals:

Bruce O’Donnell: Aeronautica Pilot. Formerly an Arbitrator in the Adeptus Arbites. Son of Magistrate Henry Alvius O'Donnell, of the same organization. Native of Setroma. A capable operative, though a bit naïve, but such is not uncommon for a new acolyte.

Ferris Karpath: Techpriest of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Native of the forge world Thorix Prime. Highly competent for an adept of his rank, though his cold, emotionless, ruthless hyper-pragmatism, coupled with his somewhat excessive puritanism, does cause me some apprehension.

“Icharus”: Sanctioned psyker of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica. Native of Void Station ██████. A psychic generalist with a slight leaning toward telepathy. Talented, but his frivolity is somewhat concerning, especially in one with his gifts. I will be watching him especially closely.

Magnus Crim (Born Magnus █████): Small-arms specialist. Son of the deceased convicted smugglers and heretics Markus and Meran █████. Born aboard the smuggling vessel The ███████ ████. Despite his parents’ transgressions, I believe him to be loyal. Though his flippancy, and, at times, sheer absurdity, are frustrating, they conceal a keen intellect. He also possesses another asset; a strong conscience, which I hope will serve to offset Ferris’s impassive disregard for human life. I will, however, be observing him closely for signs of heresy or dangerous instability.

Sarus Avram: Social specialist. Formerly a Preacher in the Adeptus Ministorum. Native of the Garden World ████████. Personally uncovered and eliminated a minor cult that had taken root within his parish.

Titus Steel: Investigative specialist. Formerly an Arbitrator in the Adeptus Arbites. Was partnered with Bruce O'Donnell. Native of Setroma. Keen eye for detail.

Acolyte Cell █-█;
Entry 2: Pre-Deployment, Setroma Mid-hive
Date: 6.███.99█.M41
Inquisitor ████████ Veros

Magistrate Alvius O'Donnell has expressed concern that a cult may be operating in the mid-hive. The Magistrate worries that sending in the Arbites would only drive the cult deeper underground, and has therefore requested my assistance in tracking down the threat in a more clandestine manner.

Apparently, one Cordell Blanquart, an Arbites Investigator, was killed while looking into potential cult activity in the Duthic District of the middle-hive. His body was found in the apartment where he had been staying during the investigation, torn limb from limb with brute force. Most of the information currently known was gathered by this individual and reported back to his superiors prior to his death.

The information indicates an unusually high incidence of mutant sightings, kidnappings, and sightings of kidnappings performed by mutants.

List of known victims:
Amadeus Neja
Modesto Labo
Sarina Grosklaus
Dolf Neall
Denita Gasch
Glendora Cassis

I am dispatching Acolyte Cell █-█ to investigate.
Can we please stop time from passing in Africa?

Hello, my name is Earthshaker, and I am the biggest brother trying to raise my 4 siblings in my 1000 mmr bracket. I was inspired by the post of mom and dad which sadly my family doesn’t have in this orphanage. So I have taken responsibility of making my brothers leaderboard players. These are my brothers I have loved over the years and I know my IQ wouldn’t be same without them.

My first brother’s name is ‘tHuG liF£’. After every kill he gets, types ‘EZ’ in all chat. Has answer to every statement the enemy makes. Sometimes ends up using spells and items because of this. Few games I have seen him just standing in some open places ideal for 20-30 minutes. Most games he doesn’t even realize he has lost. It wasn’t that battle he was fighting.

My second brother’s name is ‘THE ULTIMATE KILLER MACHINE’. He is the youngest of them all. He is the one who has gotten me from my party 1011 mmr to 110 mmr. He keeps randoming every game. Says wants to learn all heroes. Doesn’t read the spells. Just checks them in game. If that spell damages, he likes that hero otherwise he just waits for next game and his next hero. Buys +damage items only for every hero. Good thing he doesn’t know anything about divine rapier yet. Has never visited secret shop.

My third brother’s name is ‘!’ . Before the game starts he knows what he is playing. It’s Invoker. Sometimes the click spamming on that Invoker icon ends up banning it. But even if that happens he knows what he is playing. It’s his second hero Anti Mage. There isn’t much time to write about his Invoker playstyle but he 1 v 5 entire enemy team after his 40 minutes boot battlefury. Sometimes he ends up getting his second battlefury if enemies are strong players else he ends up winning in 2 items.

My fourth brother’s name is ‘PepeHands’. Uses windowed mode for playing Dota 2. Half screen is Dota 2 and half screen is twitch. Uses only mouse to play Dota 2. Keyboard is for twitch chat. He is the antithesis of ‘!’ regarding the ingame chat. Has won a game with wraith king once.

My name is Earthshaker and I am eldest brother of my 4 siblings.

Uma changed some stuff on my facebook
In addition to its current effects, Legion Commander will now be able to summon a Stonehall Legion while doing her classic routine of Jungling for 30 minutes. The Stonehall Legion will assault the camp, killing the men and women while naturalizing the children from their previous Barbarian culture to become good Stonehall Legionaries.

I think this would be a much more useful effect than the previous one, due to Legion Commanders in my pubs never leaving the Jungle enough to Duel enemies.
I actually managed to get Augustus Caesar on my first time playing Lordran
its just increases the cost and strength of the unit
He scales as the game goes on
you get shitloads of unhappiness from not being in a golden age, and you get golden ages from producing the chosen undead unit

Terra novum et caelum a Deo

Deo descendentem, a Deo.

Terra novam, caelum novum,

Novam Ierusalem, novam Ierusalem, Terra novam,

Terra novam et caelum

Afferent Gloriam honorem gentium in illam

Prima terra abiit

Terra novam et caelum et mare iam non est

Terra novam et caelum, Prima terra abiit

Terra novum et caelum

Terra novum et caelum

O gloria, gloria

Terra novam et caelum, quae prima abierunt

Terra gloria

amen.
Baba yetu, yetu uliye
Mbinguni yetu, yetu amina!
Baba yetu yetu uliye
M Jina lako e litukuzwe.

Utupe leo chakula chetu
Tunachohitaji, utusamehe
Makosa yetu, hey!
Kama nasi tunavyowasamehe
Waliotukosea usitutie
Katika majaribu, lakini
Utuokoe, na yule, muovu e milele!

Ufalme wako ufike utakalo
Lifanyike duniani kama mbinguni.

<b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">The jungle creeps threaten an uprising. If I don't stop them, who will?</b>
Last week I was playing some good old shit tier 3k mmr Injoker. I was pretending to be really good, by summoning a forge spirit every 2min to go deny power runes while I farm, kill stealing my pos 1 with sunstrike, flaming supports when they failed to gank after I am the one that cold snapped a creep. The classics. But then, something happened. The laning phase ended. And suddenly, me being able to last hit with 40 bonus damage from exort, and afk farming with midas and the occasional sunstrike to side lanes was no longer enough to help my team. They were flaming me, saying they needed help defending top, and needed space for our carry to farm bot. Naturally, as an Injoker player, I flamed them back. And told them they are garbage and it isn't my fault they lost their lanes, and that it isn't my fault QoP left my lane to go kill bottom 6 times. I gave the missing call, after all. We lost, of course. But it wasn't my fault. I was 9-1-0. I went to sleep, upset about my team losing their lanes when I was doing sooo well afk farming mid. Why can't they be as good as me? - I wondered. As I fell asleep, I saw a YouTube video of some pros that rush aghs instead of midas. With the mindset of &quot;You must skip Midas and rush Aghanim's Scepter. Getting free kills with combos every minutes is better than getting 220 gold every minute.&quot; How could killing enemies possibly be more useful than me killing the Jungle creeps? The jungle creeps threaten an uprising. If I don't stop them, who will? But, as I am open minded, the next day I decided to try it. I played Injoker mid, I asked for ward and two tangos and I rushed Aghanim's Scepter. I walked bottom and used my 3k mmr cold snap, tornado, meteor combos and killed the enemies time and time again, while my pos 1 free farmed jungle with all the space in the world. I took every T1 tower, started pushing T2's and it was then that I saw that video was right. But as I was admiring the video's heavenly advice, we got ambushed in the mid lane. The 4 of us died while my Sven was still farming in jungle. I was 14-1-19. Late game came around and we lost. It was then that I realized that if I don't afk farm the jungle creeps, someone else will. And so from that day forward I pledged to always rush midas and always afk farm jungle for the sake of my team. For the sake of keeping them out of it. Because then I will get flamed, and not them. And that is a sacrifice I must make.

At Iris, our message to women is simple: You are enough. We produce relatable, engaging video that makes our audience laugh, cry, and say, “Yep, that’s me.”
I curious as to why they chose women instead of men, because these women seem remarkably well-adjusted to their condition
These women think we should know these things
Nevermind, the stone hath been cast
Who said that?

better than after you saw this
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything, oh whoa
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speaking to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were looking forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henney and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything, oh whoa
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (what's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed (matter how my life has changed)
I keep on looking back on better days
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything, oh whoa
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I'd smash the second one not gonna lie

parsa would you prefer women with more fur?
And not carbon copies
They are all very unique in this
Its true
Kira is a thot?

Why should we appreciate them?

[Intro]
(Jojo! Jojo! Jojo!)
(Jojo! Jojo! Jojo!)

[Verse 1]
Brothers -
Two stars that run across
All the heavens in the night
And they’re stirring -
The surface of the dark
And the surface of the light
And their ripples echo together
As they’re burning bright

[PreChorus 1]
And the sun will lead the way
For all of those who seek the path - into glory
And a sacrifice to pay -
For all who would pursue
A way to rise above

(Jojo! Jojo! Jojo!)
(Jojo! Jojo!)

[Chorus 1]
Throbbing hearts are always ever
Burning as if they were in flames
The pulse that’s ever beating from their palms
The courage that is pumping through their veins
With bravery, embrace the blood that holds their fate
SONO CHI NO SADAME - JOJO

[Verse 2]
Nothing -
That he could ever do
Once the dice have all been cast
An adventure -
He wanders without end
But he never can advance
How bizarre? He tumbles and tumbles
He’s spiraling down

[PreChorus 2]
But the soul within a man
Who faces all his fears will be ever golden
And the two who met back then -
They fight so they can find
A way to rise above

(Jojo! Jojo! Jojo!)
(Jojo! Jojo!)

[Chorus 2]
And now the curtains rising on a story, a perpetual tale
As lives will clash the sparks will cast a light
On secrets hidden from their youthful days
Shine if fortune may upon tomorrow’s way
SONO CHI NO SADAME - JOJO

[Bridge]
Both their fates together in a
Knot that they can never quite untie
Ever since it started on that
Single fateful moment there in time

[Chorus]
Throbbing hearts are always ever
Burning as if they were in flames
The pulse that’s ever beating from their palms
The courage that is pumping through their veins
With bravery, embrace the blood that holds their fate

And now the curtains rising on a story, a perpetual tale
As lives will clash the sparks will cast a light
On secrets hidden from their youthful days
Shine if fortune may upon tomorrow’s way
SONO CHI NO SADAME - JOJO

any retards in the chat?
If you think time is valuable, you do end up paying
So grind
Who do you think has the time to grind cards in hearthstone who isnt a streamer, pro player or someone in between
Thats what a f2p game is suppose to make you think, hence its monetization
I did say that
So you do, but with an investment of more time
I did say that it was in the grind

Artifact is more honest with its monetization
Because thats the point
You just don't realize it
You end up paying more
Hearthstone is a f2p, the cost is baked into the game with the inherent grind and the ability to buy cards in game and recycle them into a shitty currency that is designed to fuck you over because the game is free
all those cards are also very good cards
He's pretty good
No one is making you buy the card
and then Kanna at $7
Then Drow at $10
at around $14
The most exspensive card is Axe
Buying cards in Artifact isn't that exspensive

Yeah, as Evan Meyer mentioned, acknowledging that people happen to be treated differently for what they look like seems more like being intellectually honest about the subject. He's not saying that they are different as people in any way, just that a black experience - with all the variations on what that can mean for a specific black person - is always going to be different from a white experience, at least at this point int time in America.﻿

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cal Chuchesta. The depth is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of continental philosophy and current events, most of the lyrics will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Cal's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from 19th century British literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrcis, to realise that they're not just deep- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Cal Chuchesta truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the aesthetic nuance in Cal's idealistic line &quot;Slappin' it, choppin' it, choppin' it (Ayy!)&quot; which itself is a cryptic reference to Walter Benjamin's &quot;The Work of Art in the Mechanic Age of Reproduction&quot;. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Cal's genius wit unfolds itself in their ears. What fools.. how I pity them.﻿
 

Anthony I understand that you need to cover this story and give your opinion to feed your 7 hungry children, but did you need to scream the N word for at least 2 minutes at the end?﻿


Great video, but was it really necessary to invert your red flannel halfway through, revealing it to be a confederate flag? Little overboard maybe﻿
Anthony, thank you for always balancing mature and measured social commentary with a unique and actually entertaining  personal take. Few can manage to accomplish both. Unsubscribed.﻿

I found that video tangentially, the actual video itself that he made his video in response to was a long debate

I did mention that she was really unprofessional before the interview and that really made him especially impatient in this interview
He is, but she's implying what he's doing is somehow consciously malignant
I think he said that because she was definitely trying to frame him as some sort of snake oil salesman to discredit him
I don't doubt that at all, I think he's definitely making some money off of this
I don't know the man myself so I couldn't say, but thats just as likely
Could be
I think it's probably due to assuming everyone has a familiarity given the Bible and thus references to god are found throughout western civilization

Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream.
A murky, nuttish land.
A place where not nutting may mend your ailing mind.
You will lose everything...
... once Branded.
The symbol of the nut.
An augur of nut.
Your past. Your future. Your very seed.
None will have meaning, and you won't even care.
By then, you'll be something other than human.
A thing that feeds on nutting.
A nutter.
Long ago, in a walled off land, far to the north, a great king built a great kingdom.
I believe they called it Nutleic.
Perhaps you're familiar.
No, how could you be.
But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate.
Without really knowing why...
Like a nutter drawn to a thirst trap.
Your cock will burn in anguish.
Time after time.
For that is your fate.
The fate of the Nutter.<e_m a="live:miles.cal" ts_ms="1543636733053" ts="1543636733" t="61"></e_m>

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Alright, um, Wolf Haley, Odd Future, Wolf Gang nigga
You know what, you know, fuck it
I don't even wanna go
I'm gonna let my little brother Earl Sweatshirt get on you niggas
Hey Earl, hit em...

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
So I'm guessing there's questions that need addressing, huh?
Like how we fresh in our adolescence and wrecking 'em
Hand 'em tracks, he destined to make a mess of 'em
Snapping necks and records in matter of seconds, check 'em son
Lost an erection and found it in an aggressive nun
Fucking chin-checking punks 'til he's outta breath and done
No FX, in these doper than sess sessions son
Chilling for a while on a pile of the rest of 'em
Let the crowd choose who can fucking last longer
It's the rap monger, rap monster, Earl Sweat, attack, conquer
Lose least, niggas lost like the last blanca chica
That we picked up at the last concert
Please, get out your seat, get out your seat, verses written with scalpels
He's the junior king standing out shouting on the balcony
How come he's not in counseling? Fucker's loud while he's sound asleep
Heard he was dope as Sour D, nigga, was Courage cowardly?
Stay gold, alchemy, nigga we rap's alpha team
Mr. Teen and Mr. T with a mouth full of powder
And a nose full of chowder, he's chopping up all the doubters see
Now watch him count the bodies like bitches be counting calories

[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]
Fuck with the Wolves, we starting to bark viciously
Catch us in a pile of bodies where dead bitches be
Box Logo hoodies and goodies from buddies that understand
That Bastard was buzzing like Woody so we get it for free
Had to duct tape the mother goose; the mask was off
I stumbled down a hill then I had Jill jack me off
Harder than my dick when Taylor Swift is in my basement
Cause I've been doing this since Pooh fucked Christopher Robinson
Wolf Gang knitted on my cotton like some smelly
Dirty rotten nigga picked it from a cotton gin
Do not give a fuck I've got the swagger of a virgin's dick
But if I did it would be bigger than Earl's upper lip
Sip sizzurp, Supreme on my shizzirt
I munch a bunch of tacos with Waverly's favorite wizard
The favorite nigga turned into Freddy Kruger
And this that raw shit, dead bodies chopped up in the sewer
From the palms of Jeffrey Dahmer, baby mamas said the kicks
Beat like the brown lip balm that was made for Rihanna
All you fucking bloggin' faggots yappin' up that extra shit
I'll shove Bastard down your throat, regurgitate my excrement
Them 2DopeBoyz is fairies they're Peter like boysenberries
Meka scary, turn his white ass to a Jim Carrey twin
A fuckin' sausage fest will them shaky niggas get married then
2DopeBoyz don't want beef, they're just overweight vegetarians

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Fucking faggots
Wolf Gang, Kill 'Em All
Don't give a fuck, litter life
Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator
I mean, Wolf Haley
Fucking radical

[Outro: Jasper Dolphin]
Haha Niggas murdered this shit, know what I’m saying
Odd Future Wolf Gang, know what I’m saying
Fuck them dope faggots my niggas
We don’t give a fuck nigga, we a wolf pack my nigga, we keep you up barking and shit nigga
Niggas, little niggas doing it big, know what I’m saying, y'all niggas 40 and shit still in the game
These young niggas come outta nowhere taking out all that shit, know what I’m saying
Give me a iced out motherfucking Odd Future donut chain, like fuck everybody else nigga, Wolf Gang

If they made it so that you get a baseline amount of cards just through playing it and removed the price tag, it would literally print money
damb
Is there no way to get cards without buying them?

He's successful, it doesn't mean he's the brightest bulb in the building xd
It true, he doesn't have enough braincells left to have an agenda
Yeah, its very tiring
absolutely autistic
and used Young Thug as an example of a good rapper
Literally said Future drowned his sorrows in codeine as if that was admirable
Calling white privilege on Posty and then absolutely romanticizing other black trap rappers like they're so inspired and original
Also like an absolute cuck
He literally sounded like any other neckbeard on reddit with too much time to think about really minute things
Anonymous internet forums exist for that purpose, not news organizations
I'm just amazed the post thought that that article was worth publishing
It was just about how blacker berries are sweeter than the ones that aren't as dark
Yes it does, Michael if you don't submit to the groupthink you're a nazi and need to be vilified
Music
For not calling what is essentially elevator music over some crying in the background
What a fool I am
You're right, I just can't appreciate his unique and original sound

I lost my virginity while listening to this song 5 years ago, it's a funny story really.. i had just finished my gym workout and i was in the locker room all sweaty, and in walks this leather dressed jabroni.. he seemed confused as to where he was.. i told him he might have gotten the wrong door, then he got very rude and said &quot;fuck you&quot;, then i said &quot;nah fuck you leatherman&quot; and then it escalated from there﻿
He's a good boy

We never paid any heed to the ancient prophecies. Like fools we clung to the old hatreds, and fought as we had for generations. Until the day the sky rained fire, and a new enemy came upon us. We stand now, upon the brink of destruction, for the reign of chaos has come at last.

Is the campaign ready?
Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised to see your kind here. Many adventurers have travelled this way since the recent troubles began.

No doubt you've heard about the tragedy that befell the town of r/Diablo. Some say that Activision, the Lord of Casul, walks the world again.

I don't know if I believe that, but Blizzard did travel this route a few weeks ago. He was headed east to the mountain pass guarded by the D3 Community Managers.

Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to have trailed in his wake. You see, shortly after the Blizzard went through, the subreddits were closed and strange creatures began ravaging the internet.

Until it's safer outside the camp and the gates are re-opened, I'll remain here with my caravan. I hope to leave for Wraeclast before the shadow that fell over D3 consumes us all. If you're still alive then, I'll take you along.

You should talk to Bex, too. She seems to be the leader of this camp. Maybe she can tell you more.﻿

So you're telling me that if you went around and fucked more than 10 guys right now, you would not be gay?
I'm gonna lose it
Guys if we don't do what they do in this video

If a woman sleeps with 10 guys, she would be considered a slut.

I think QT really has the homeless man look going on well though
Bigger than we could imagine
I mean even bigger milo
If QT was a male model in how he looked there is no doubt in my mind he would be one of the biggest streamers
No, we're being pedantic cucks and jerking ourselves off xd
Not that being attractive isn't beneficial
QT is proof that skill and charisma (personality) are greater than attractiveness
I watch QT for looks

Born in the Dire Safelane Hard Camp at the five minute mark, Neil &quot;Armstrong&quot; Centaur was constripted to the Dire cause at 11:59 by Faceless Void. Throughout his long life, Neil participated in fights in both the Top and Bottom lanes, and secured a kill on Weaver in the Middle lane. Neil even experiencecd stopped time within his master iceiceice's Chronosphere, but that short moment of immortality wasn't enough for such a respectable centaur, loving father, and loyal minion. In his final minutes, Neil valiantly fought off a weaver beetle infestation before succumbing to a Radiant Tower projectile. Neil died at 15:31 surrounded by his teamates, and exacting revenge on the Weaver who caused him so much pain. In the immortal words of Tsunami643, &quot;You [Neil] died a hero... you beautiful beautiful boy...&quot;

Hey Everyone,

Buckle up guys, this is one hair-raising update! Today marks the beginning of our Halloween event, Vampire DLC pack and New Map!

Halloween Event: Trick or Treat

We’re releasing a wide variety of unique cosmetic seasonal rewards alongside some spooky map decorations and another chance to play with the development team so make sure you’re online!



How you gain those sweet Halloween rewards:
Want to unlock exclusive Halloween rewards? All you need to do is keep your eyes open for delicious in game candy. Collect the candy and it’ll turn into Halloween points; earn enough and you’ll unlock some sweet rewards. To make things a little more difficult the smaller candy rewards the most points, so look for the toffee apples and elusive golden gummy bears if you want to unlock everything as fast as possible.

The types of candy and size classifications are as follows:
2 Points - Big Gummy Bears (Huge)
4 Points - Bowl of Sweets (Large)
6 Points - Chocolate Bars (Medium)
10 Points - Toffee Apples (Small)
20 Points - Golden Gummy Bears (Tiny)

Lastly there will also be special loot booth tokens available during the holiday. Each loot booth reward comes with a number of Halloween points based on its tier, meaning that even common unlocks can help you chase down Halloween legendary items before the end of the holiday.

Additionally, there are some performance based bonuses outlined below:
When escaping as an innocent player you will receive an additional 50% points on top of whatever you have picked up in the game.
When executing an innocent as an infected player you will receive an additional 25% points per execution on top of whatever you have picked up in the game.

What are the new rewards?
This year’s event rewards will be visible in the event screen which is available in the top left of the main menu. You can also use this to track your progress towards the next reward and your overall progress throughout the event.

The event rewards are as follows:
Moonlight Emblem - Unlocked at 50 points
Pentagram Wristband - Unlocked at 200 points
Hatchet Melee Weapon - Unlocked at 500 points
Smashed Defeat Pose - Unlocked at 1250 points
Sweet Skull Gun - Unlocked at 2250 points
Alex’s Pumpkin Suit - Unlocked at 3400 points
Cat Emblem - Unlocked at 5000 points
Get Lit Victory Pose - Unlocked at 7500 points

Demonic Rachel - Unlocked at 25000 points

Halloween Tokens:
Halloween Tokens will replace normal tokens for the duration of the event in both level up rewards and through token purchases (they will not replace the tokens awarded from the Werewolf and Vampire Packs).

To spend Halloween Tokens simply go to the loot booth as normal and select a Halloween Token to give to the shady dealer.

Last Year’s Rewards – In the loot booth for a limited time!
In addition to these rewards, previous Halloween seasons’ rewards will be available in the loot booth for the duration of the event when using a Halloween token!

Vampire DLC Pack

With the Vampire Expansion, you will be able to prey on innocent victims as you transform into the exclusive Vampire Terror form! This terror form offers a brand new terror tactic through its active: the Swarm.



When used, the Vampire temporarily shape-shifts into a swarm of bats to traverse the vent system at hellish speed leaving a puff of smoke in your wake. Know where the innocents are hiding or need a quick getaway from those trying to down you? The “Swarm” active places you exactly where you want to be almost instantly to give you that terror advantage.

Additionally, when playing as an innocent you’ll gain access to an exclusive new Stake melee weapon to defend yourself against deadly vampiric attacks.

The Vampire pack also includes an exclusive Vampire Emblem, 10 loot booth tokens to help you get even more cosmetic gear for your character and 200 GM tokens to put towards your next item or use with the Reputation system to show appreciation to your favourite fellow players.

This pack contains:
Exclusive: Playable Vampire Terror
Exclusive: ‘You Suck’ T-shirt
Exclusive: Stake Melee Weapon
Exclusive: Vampire Emblem
10 Loot Booth Tokens
200 GM Credits

Sink your fangs into this pack now by clicking here.

Wakizashi!
Linked to this we’ve added a special something for those people who unlock both the Vampire and Werewolf packs. Do this and you’ll get your hands on a traditional Japanese sword known as the Wakizashi; a new legendary melee weapon!

Lumberyard Map (Coming 29th October)

Last but definitely not least, a new map we’re calling The Lumberyard!



We’re making our final polishes (to the wood) and will talk more about it leading up to the release on Monday 29th October.

Bug Fixes

Slight nerf to the Yeti Terror attributes and ability
You can no longer take bloodbags, items and objectives on floors that haven't been unlocked yet
You can no longer interact with fuses and fuseboxes through walls
You no longer get infinite executes when performing the action whilst you’re jumping
Improved randomness in who is selected as the Terror
The ring on ring objectives will now shrink and vanish when the objective is complete
Clearer waypoints for doors and fuseboxes, closest waypoint always has 100 alpha
User Interface
New loading screen imagery for all maps
The transform keybind now shows in the Terror icon at the bottom of the game screen
Added customise clothing button the character preference interface
Added some instructions to the Loot Booth for new users
The cursor should no longer break out of the game window and cause problems

Added objects to reduce overpowered lines of sight in Forest

The Gnome is immunized against all dangers: one may call him a scoundrel, parasite, swindler, profiteer, it all runs off him like water off a raincoat. But call him a Gnome and you will be astonished at how he recoils, how injured he is, how he suddenly shrinks back: “I’ve been found out.”﻿

It was basically someone jerking themself off over how violence is portrayed in videogames and how its &quot;bad&quot; because it doesn't pay tribute to what its actually like in real life
The person who wrote that article also probably believes videogames make people violent, because equating dropping a nuclear bomb in real life and comparing it to the use of one in a videogame is intellectually disingenuous

It was
Its true
A strict regimen is paramount, if one is to master the brutal arithmetic of combat.	
Every creature has a weakness. The wise hero trains for what she will face.	
Some may fall, but their knowledge lives on.	
Fan the flames! Mold the metal! We are raising an army!
A sharper sword, a stronger shield. Anything to prolong a soldier's life.	
In the end, every plan relies upon a strong arm, and tempered steel.	
A man in a robe, claiming communion with the divine. Madness.	
Gilded icons and dogmatic rituals... for some, a tonic against the bloodshed.	
A little hope, however desperate, is never without worth.	
Strong drink, a game of chance, and companionship. The rush of life.	
All manner of diversion and dalliance await those who cross the threshold with coin in hand.	
With enough ale, maybe they can be inured against the horrors below.	
Word is travelling. Ambition is stirring in distant cities. We can use this.	
More arrive, foolishly seeking fortune and glory in this domain of the damned.	
Great heroes can be found even here, in the mud and rain.	
All the decadent horrors I have seen pale in comparison with that final, crowning thing. I could not look, nor could I look away!	
An eternity of futile struggle — a penance for my unspeakable transgressions.	
All my life, I could feel an insistent gnawing in the back of my mind. It was a yearning, a thirst for discovery that could be neither numbed, nor sated.	
Can you feel it? The walls between the sane world and that unplumbed dimension of delirium are tenuously thin here...	
The plume and the pistol — a fitting end to my folly, and a curse upon us all.	
We dug for months, years — an eternity. And we were rewarded with madness.	
You answered the letter — now like me, you are part of this place.	
Let me share with you the terrible wonders I have come to know...	
Trouble yourself not with the cost of this crusade - its noble end affords you broad tolerance in your choice of means.	
Curiosity, interest, and obsession — mile markers on my road to damnation.	
There is a great horror beneath the manor: a Crawling Chaos that must be destroyed!	
I can still see their angry faces as they stormed the manor, but I was dead before they found me, and the letter was on its way.	
My obsession caused this great foulness, and it is shameful that I must rely upon you to set it right.	
The degeneracy of the Hamlet is nothing, I fear, when compared to the condition of surrounding acres.	
The poor Caretaker, I fear his long-standing duties here have ...affected him.	
I see something long-absent in the sunken faces of passersby - a glimmer of hope.	
	Our family name, once so well regarded, is now barely whispered aloud by decent folk.
Once, our estate was the envy of this land...	
In truth I cannot tell how much time has passed since I sent that letter.
	I was lord of this place, before the crows and rats made it their domain.	
I remember days when the sun shone, and laughter could be heard from the tavern.
In time, you will know the tragic extent of my failings...	
	Most will end up here, covered in the poisoned earth, awaiting merciful oblivion.
Trinkets and charms, gathered from all the forgotten corners of the earth...
At home in wild places, she is a stalwart survivor, and a strict instructor.	
Make no mistake, we will face ever greater threats. Our soldiers must be ready.	
The bellows blast once again! The forge stands ready to make weapons of war.
The cobwebs have been dusted, the pews set straight. The Abbey calls to the faithful...
Fresh kegs, cards, and curtained rooms promise solace to the weary and the broken alike.	
Women and men; soldiers and outlaws; fools and corpses. All will find their way to us now that the road is clear.	
The cost of preparedness - measured now in gold, later in blood.	
This sprawling estate, a Mecca of madness and morbidity. Your work begins...
Welcome home, such as it is. This squalid hamlet, these corrupted lands, they are yours now, and you are bound to them.	
An ambush! Send these vermin a message: the rightful owner has returned, and their kind is no longer welcome.	
Leave nothing unchecked, there is much to be found in forgotten places.
Dispatch this thug in brutal fashion, that all may hear of your arrival!
Brigands have the run of these lanes. Keep to the side path; the Hamlet is just ahead.	
You will arrive along the old road. It winds with a troubling, serpent-like suggestion through the corrupted countryside. Leading only, I fear, to ever more tenebrous places. There is a sickness in the ancient pitted cobbles of the old road and on its writhing path you will face viciousness, violence, and perhaps other damnably transcendent terrors. So steel yourself and remember: there can be no bravery without madness. The old road will take you to hell, but in that gaping abyss we will find our redemption.

Cyberpunk longtime 
hour of gameplay
Mr monkey plays Fallout 76 xd
It reminds me of Berserk, only he hunts goblins
Its pretty dark Omegalul
Yeah wait, he just murdered a bunch of goblin children and Im pretty sure they were raping their human women captives
It seems memey enough for me to watch it
and has only 2 spell slots left
and of course saves a cleric waifu who was in distress
I think theres some kind of heroes guild involved and people go into the caves to hunt goblins but get fucked by them and then Goblin Slayer shows up to kill them
and its almost exactly like DnD
Apparently there is an anime about a guy who just kills Goblins
Oh BERRY clean
for good luck of course
You should just find an alley way and shit in it, Mars
Im guessing from the same place she got the burrito it came with
I dont know where my mom got it
and painful
its just really hot

it doesnt even taste

Ruin has come to our family. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. Gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor. I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor shadowed manor. Fattened by decadence and luxury. And yet, I began to tire of conventional extravagance. Singular, unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnamable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on swarthy workmen and sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt-soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations we unearthed that damnable portal and antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth but we were in a realm of death and madness! In the end, I alone fled laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity. Until consciousness failed me. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you, return home, claim your birthright, and deliver our family from the ravenous clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon.

Ruin has come to our family. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. Gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor. I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor shadowed manor. Fattened by decadence and luxury. And yet, I began to tire of conventional extravagance. Singular, unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnamable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on swarthy workmen and sturdy shovels.

But the dragonslayers and abysswalkers and dark wraiths are just interesting and fun
ideally that is
You just stack regen on all of your party members the entire fight and then they just heal off any damage they still have while you're goin through the dungeon
Actually the gwyndolin character is almost busted in terms of healing
Im basically playing dark souls, but not xd
I'm actually really enjoying Darkest Dungeon with all the dlc and mods

This is satire.
Filthy Frank is the embodiment of everything a person should not be. He is anti-PC, anti-social, and anti-couth.  He behaves and reacts excessively to everything expressly to highlight the ridiculousness of racism, misogyny, legalism, injustice, ignorance and other social blights. He also sets an example to show how easy it is in the social media for any zany material to gain traction/followings by simply sharing unsavoury opinions and joking about topics many find offensive.There is no denying that the show is terribly offensive, but this terrible offensiveness is a deliberate and unapologetic parody of the whole social media machine and a reflection of the human microcosm that that social media is.

Yeah, and it makes people not just play themselves
Yeah, the reason I thought of it was because it allows the characters to be more in line with the world the DM makes
Simple characters reacting to one another produce interesting reactions
Its true

Its more fun to change how you play around a pre-existing template
I myself don't mind being given a character
xd
which is also the same place I got Hector the Well-Endowed from
Because I remembered the episode of Community where they played DnD
I realized the most successful way to run a DnD campaign around a story the GM is interested in directing is to have the GM make all the characters beforehand and then have the players be randomly assigned a character
Also

but it packed a punch
I'm not sure what it is exactly
I just had a legitimately spicy hot sauce that put me into physical pain
Invisible goat men named Richard as far as the eye could see

An eon passed, yet there's still no sign of a patch called 7.19d

&quot;But it's ok Drakus_&quot;, they said, &quot;You can simply just buy detection&quot;

Yet they failed to see that the true sight does not equal true protection

The days grow darker, colder still, Hallow's Eve draws close and near

And the only thing that stalks the lanes is terror, constant states of fear

For who knows where the one they call Richard will show up, and appear

And slow you with his Diffusal Blade, backstabbing with a malevolent sneer

Long we have waited, and perhaps for even longer we have suffered

So all I can humbly request now with my dying breath is, &quot;Please Mr. Lizard&quot;

When? When did I start waiting for my opponent to make the first move? When, indeed? It became a routine. The loser held out his hands in gratitude for the lesson and I graciously accepted without skipping a beat. As if that was what I wanted!! That's not how it should be!! For so long, I sought the height of perfection. I dreamed of giving my heart and soul to battle an unstoppable adversary!! I'm a lucky man. I'm thankful for everything that led me to this point... that led me to you!!

It finally happened- I sustained my first combat injury. Command wanted us to take this godforsaken hill- despite our recon saying it was too well-defended. What could go wrong? Napalm the shit out of it, lob some artillery on those fuckers and roll in some tankers. Right? Yeah, sounds great until the airwing is tied up and the artillery needs to be resupplied. This place is a fucking mess. Whatever-  we move in, until we get pinned down and air support is unavailable. That's when the fucking gook nails me in the ass. You know, you get hardened to seeing other people die, but getting shot yourself is a different story. Wanted to cry like a bitch. At least I'll be out of comission for a while. Getting some leave will be just what I need.

I think I'd be a specialist
Each persons ability is strongly tied to their personality and there are 6 types of nen users
so its literally the manifestation of your will
Because you can work at gaining more aura through meditation and practice, but Nen literally means will
Its similar in that regard that it is like mana, but thats where the similarities end
Actually apparently Naruto is largely copied from Hunter x hunter
It bears a superficial resemblance to chakra from Naruto

Its called Nen, and its a lot like an rpg system for magic but it gets quite complex
Mainly because I wish there was a game that had its magic system

I like some of their pop stuff, but their old stuff was really good
Coldplay do be different now
They weren't interested in making more music like it
Yeah, thats why they disappeared after they got big off of it
yeeeee
Everything else they do is closer to like an alternative-grunge sound
Float on is actually kind of an oddity in their work

Joji is just milking the tits of a cow that was already dead when he found it
Yeah seriously, he atleast had to try and be creative
But that being said, he's still basically making the same song over and over
The beat isnt down beat to the point where I just immediately think of his other stuff
It doesnt try to be a sad boi too hard
But its a bit different
Not that its hugely different
Slow Dancing in the Dark is his best song so far, just because it's somewhat different from his other stuff
Actually I will say

&quot;Literal vampire potbelly goblins are hobbling around coming after us&quot;
Damn, I love Pugna. As soon as the match begins and I have the cute little green guy all to myself, I know that nothing's going to stop me from smiling and laughing for the next hour or so.My secret is that I am the lover to that little gooey goblin. Pugna is my everything and he makes me feel ethereal with intimacy. Pugna's kit makes him the ultimate lovemaking machine, like that is what he was built to do. I picture that I am a lonely squire, secluded on my bed in my quarters, when the royal Pugna walks in, removes his Nether Lord's Regalia, and says &quot;The Nether's reach is long!&quot;. In this moment, I know that Pugna will have his way with me. First, big P will use his Nether Blast, a powerful burst of pure spine-chilling pleasure that oozes to every crevice of my body, I feel as though I'm going to erupt with ecstasy. That is Pugna's signal that I am his for the taking...Next, He decrepifies me, and suddenly I am on cloud nine, in a surreal frame of body and mind, and every touch of Pugna sends orgasmic chills down my spine, as though I am unable to even move, paralyzed by the insurmountable wave of pleasure overcoming me, it's as though I can't even try to resist, even if I wanted to, and Pugna further asserts his dominance over me and everything I am.By now Pugna has me right where he wants me, I try to tell him to slow down, but I am on his time now. While P is the ultimate lover, I need to know that he owns me. My Green Daddy puts down his nether ward, so now, if I try to resist daddies urges, I will be punished... every squirm and gasp goes noticed, and I am zapped like a canine with a shock collar. It should hurt... but.. it doesn't, with each zap I feel myself coming closer to the edge, and by now daddy knows that I am his. Everything I thought I knew about my body is out the window, none of it belongs to me, it belongs to Pugna now.At this point I am ready to burst, It's as though the slightest movement will bring me to climax, but I know daddy isn't finished with me yet... That's when he does it. Everything else had been child's play compared to what I would experience next. Pugna inhaled deeply, and before I could even react, I was welcomed to the the good suck. Oh my God. The moment Pugna graced me with his suck, I came with such an incredible force and power, the likes of which I have never experienced before. Pugna didn't stop. He kept sucking and sucking and the cum continued to erupt from my member, rope after rope of my juices being absorbed into my Daddy Pugna's throat, and he never missed a single drop. It felt as though my very being was leaving my body and entering his, in the form of my spunk. This orgasmic revelation continued until I was completely dry, and only then was I released from his suck.Daddy wiped his mouth, smiling, I could tell he was pleased with my offering. Since I had been absolutely depleted by him, Pugna tucked me in, and left as swiftly as he had entered. I didn't want it to end, I wished he would walk back in and take me all over again. But I started to doze off, I was so sleepy from my gargantuan orgasm, so I knew I had to catch some bzz's, and just pray that I would dream it all over again...Damn, I love Pugna.

You're at home one afternoon by yourself, just relaxing on the couch. You hear a soft knock at the door. You open it, not knowing quite what to expect. It's Todd Howard. He's young and super fit, just out of game developer school and full of youthful optimism. He's wearing this sexy outfit that makes him look like he's from the medieval ages or like he's going to a renaissance fair. He tells you about a new game he just made, Skyrim. He's going door to door selling his game, just trying to get enough money together for his first game studio.You tell him, hey, good luck partner, but I don't need any more games right now. You're about to shut the door when he takes a step forward. You don't understand, he explains, he really, really wants to sell you a copy of Skyrim. In fact, he'd do just about anything to close the deal...

Yeah I think that's true
Old style RPG's like that are essentially like reading books in how they play, its very much a cerebral passive experience
I think it was for the popularity, because I don't think a top-down isometric RPG would have appealed to as wide an audience as a shooter would have.

That's because Dark Souls 2 was inconsistent in its theme, so much so that they brought Miyazaki in to try and make sense of the direction. Also I wouldn't say its self-contained as the implication of the ending is that your decision ultimately doesn't matter, there will be someone else who comes along, gets all the lord souls and reignites the first flame or lets it die out

They literally don't even touch upon the theme of fire or what the constant struggle to not die is really indicative of (which is the darkness within ourselves, because we internalize our want and therefore internalize the origin of our suffering; our suffering being the want to struggle against fate. which is why maintaining humanity/ember is such an important mechanic)
This video makes me sad, because they use Dark Souls 2 as the main body of evidence and go utterly off base as they use a Freudian-Oedipus complex to explain imagery which is probably unintentional and if it is intentional is a ancillary theme rather than a guiding theme of the game
There's that, but there's also a planet in Rogue Trader which is essentially mobile hive-cities waging an endless war with each other
Great video Melon, but I'm not sure it was necessary to show us your body pillow of the Planters mascot
I was sitting in the theater, Watching Incredibles 2, and I was quietly eating some beans, keeping to my self, like normal, when, half way through the movie, a black teenager came and sat in the same isle as me, a few seats away from me. I notice him and my hands go cold. My brow starts to sweat. I can’t even focus on the movie. I knew I had to put my beans away. I slowly bent over, trying to place my beans on the floor, out of sight, behind my tote bag that contained 47 more cans of beans. I set the open can on the floor. I started to slowly sit back up in my seat, but then, because I ate so many beans, it happened. During a very quiet scene, I farted so loud, it must’ve set a record. It was a juicy one, and I felt every person in the theater look at me. Some chuckled. But the one I was most worried about was the black teenager. I knew I had to get out of there. But, as I frantically stood up, I tripped on the bag of beans. The bag toppled over, and the 47 cans of beans rolled onto the floor. I turned and tried to run out of there, but it was too late. He saw. In a deep booming voice, he yelled “THIS NIGGA EATING BEANS!” Everyone started laughing. I fell to the floor, defeated. I started weeping. Never have I been so embarrassed. Only Later, after the movie ended, I was able to walk out of there. I am committing suicide after I finish writing this. This is a warning. You don’t think it can happen to you, but it can. Moral of the story: don’t go in a movie theater where a black teenager is present, whilst eating beans.
you're not about rap thing
And not spreading this degenerate talk of &quot;booty on the outside&quot;
Thank you Michael, atleast I'm making lyrics, Mars

It's basically dame tu cosita

Not gonna lie the weird dancing alien thing is not my favorite meme, its basically a poor man's surreal meme without any of the charming post-ironicness

I said its kind of plagiarism, theres a clear line when you're literally directly making something in imitation of something else, but making a slight alteration is somewhat disingenuous because its like referencing something without committing to the idea of it while still essentially trying to create that very same thing
I didn't realize Miyazaki literally took them directly from Berserk
Ahh, thou'rt a bibber
Would you prefer the earth to be a waterworld or become an ash wasteland?
That's something I can get behind
I'm not sure why this is an issue
I'm not against mods, I'm just saying in this case mods shouldn't have been necessary to begin with
I'm saying there shouldn't be a need for the mod in the first place, even if its there, it represents a shortcoming of the developer to actually make a functioning game.
That's what I mean
Why should the consumer be the one to bear that burden when its the dev's job to make it work in the first place?
Also, that's a false equivalency because your assuming the car works opitmally
It was their first time porting something to PC, but that doesn't mean it gets a pass
The base game wasn't actually developed to its fullest.
I mean, can you really say a game is better than another if you have to go in and basically fix it yourself to enjoy it significantly more?
I mean, if we're talking strictly PC, DS Remastered is better than the original release because the original PC release was actually horribly ported and they realized that and fixed it in remastered.

Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream.A murky, forgotten land.A place where shrooms may mend your ailing mind.You will lose everything...... once Branded.The symbol of the stoner.An augur of dankness.Your past. Your future. Your very light.None will have meaning, and you won't even care.By then, you'll be something other than human.A thing that feeds on smoke.A Hollow who tokes.Long ago, in a walled off land, far to the north, a great king built a great kingdom.I believe they called it Angeles National Forest.Perhaps you're familiar.No, how could you be.But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate.Without really knowing why...Like a moth drawn to a flame.Your weed will burn in anguish.Time after time.For that is your fate.The fate of the high.

Diego's been abducted it would appear
In the Age of Ancients the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray joints, Ashtrays, and Everlasting Dickheads. But then there was Weed and with weed came disparity. Toke and cough, life and death, and of course, rip and chop. Then from the dank, They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the Weed. Michael, the First of the Dank, The Witch of Memelo and his Daughters of Chops, Mars, the Lord of Lighters, and his faithful stoners. And the Furtive Philip, so easily forgotten.With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dickheads. Mars's mighty tokes peeled apart their thick hides. The Witches weaved great smokestorms. Michael unleashed a miasma of dank and wheeze. And Diego the Thiccness betrayed his own, and the Dickheads were no more.Thus began the Age of Weed. But soon the flames will fade and only Dark will remain. Even now there are only embers, and man sees not weed, but only empty bowls. And amongst the smoking are seen, carriers of the accursed Danksign.Yes, indeed. The Danksign brands the smoking. And in this land, the smoking are corralled and led to the Angeles Forest, where they are locked away, to await the end of the world... This is your fate.Only, in the ancient legends it is stated, that one day an smoking shall be chosen to leave the smoking asylum, in pilgrimage, to the land of ancient lords, Lordran.

A new name for something quite old. Men with taste &amp; style who know about fashion, art, and culture have always existed. In past centuries, these kinds of men were in the uppercrust of society (more leisure time). Technology has enabled men with more leisure time, so less wealthy males can now fuss over their looks and aesthetics almost as much as women. An American Metrosexual is like your average European male. In France or Italy, men can be manly and work on cars and know about art and fashion at the same time. They are cool with that and don't need some special name for the less &quot;masculine&quot; side. In the U.S. we think men all have to be eithrt dumb gorillas or homosexuals. There is some grey area! There is an emphasis on not being pretentious in america that itself becomes a kind of pretentiousness. Men who dabble in vanity or in lofty romantic concerns seem less like men when in fact, they are probably better lovers to women than their traditional counterpart.

Can I play as a rogue trader of the House Duquesne?
Rogue Trader is a tabletop RPG based in Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 setting. It is published by Fantasy Flight Games and is part of their 40k-based RPG line, making it mechanically very similar to and broadly compatible with Dark Heresy, Deathwatch, Black Crusade, and Only War (and all their associated splatbooks).

The basic premise of the game has the players take on the roles of a Rogue Trader and his retinue of trusted officers (altogether referred to as &quot;Explorers&quot; by the system) as the command staff of a starship. With wealth, privilege and power undreamt of by the average Imperial citizen, Rogue Traders are free to explore the galaxy at the edges and, indeed, beyond the boundaries of established Imperial space. Far from the prying eyes of the Inquisition or other Imperial authorities, any method of furthering their interests and making profit is on the cards; strip-mining, enslaving, or depopulating entire worlds are within the realms of possibility, and many crews are not above consorting with xenos or even turning to heretical means to achieve their own ends. The players are free to role play the crew of a noble exploration vessel, a band of piratical looters, or anything in between - more than any other in the 40K RPG line, Rogue Trader offers players the most freedom and choice as to what they wish to achieve and how they go about doing it. Generally speaking, Rogue Traders answer to no-one but themselves and their Warrant of Trade lets them go where they please with relative impunity (although it still behooves them to try and stay in the Imperium's good graces).

From a mechanical perspective, the game is extremely similar to FFG's other 40K RPG lines and is, broadly speaking, mechanically compatible with them - Rogue Trader in fact includes rules and guidelines for porting Dark Heresy characters into a Rogue Trader game, and vice-versa (having been published before Deathwatch it makes no mention of that line, but is still compatible). The core of the rules is a percentile system where the player must roll a d100 and compare to a target number (usually a character attribute plus/minus relevant modifiers) to determine whether or not (and how well) they succeed at a given task. As in Dark Heresy, characters find themselves belonging to a specific career path which determines the availability of advances that can be purchased with their earned experience, although the careers in Rogue Trader are significantly more powerful than the Dark Heresy counterparts - a starting-rank RT character is considered roughly equivalent to a DH character with 5000XP. Character generation is much more involved than in Dark Heresy, with the players deciding on a multi-step &quot;origin path&quot; for their character (each step of which provides a choice of options with various mechanical effects).

Other notable differences in Rogue Trader's rules as compared to Dark Heresy include a significantly reworked system for psychic powers and techniques (RT uses attribute tests instead of DH's power dice), in-depth rules for the operation of starships and ship-to-ship combat, and the abandonment of the concrete monetary system in DH for the abstract &quot;Profit Factor&quot;, which is tested against when making purchases, Rogue Traders being so fantastically wealthy and their wealth so diversely invested and represented that a simple monetary value becomes meaningless. Abstract rules for undertaking profit-making endeavors such as establishing trade routes and other commercial objectives are also included.
It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die. 

Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse. 

To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods. note

Best game of the year

also buy vermintide 2 before release
Aye
Say &quot;Aye&quot;
All in favor
I propose that from henceforth we refer to the act of gathering as a collective as &quot;vermintide anyone?&quot; and that all references to &quot;team&quot; be retroactively struck from all records and memory.
I like these hams
yeh
its on sale now though
like in less than 2 weeks
its coming out very soon
that's why we've been saying get vermintide 2

we need to encounter more farmers

lul
its a witcher thing
yeah
as a witcher my maximum natural for agility and wisdom is 24, so can I add skill points to that still?
wait
EAZE clap
Like there was definite social messaging
I feel like SJW doesn't quite get at what the problem was though
I hope so
how would pokimane feel?
unfort
Ham sandwich perhaps?
how was dinner?
David
ulu
They literally live in a monarchial isolationist ethnostate
The people have spoken
Jett, I'm sorry, but popular opinion says you're racist
and got enslaved
and the reason black people die
youre racist
if not
have you seen the movie?
jett
Actually, they very deliberately point out that they kill and or forcibly remove any intruders who wandered in
David, how did you like the movie?
that's why
BECUZ THEY WAS KANGZ
LuL
holograms
Like, he was the thinly veiled racism the movie was okay with having on the screen
I love that he was just literally a BLM member and a dickhead
I'm not even joking
Eggxactly
He was like a member of Black Live Matter
he was literally &quot;I hate white people&quot; the character
the villain was great
not if you're juiced up on vibranium flower juice
He was just the unabashed militant black panther from the 60's
Michael B jordans character was my favorite
Yeah, but its not like a huge part of the story, its the fluff
its just a motif
the panther was like icing on the cake
idk wtf that was about
yeah
that its conducive to life
Its also implied the vibranium has some kind of passive effect on people
I mean, Tony stark is literally just a genius and he made all kinds of shit by himself
^
That's kind of part of the disbelief you need to suspend if you want to watch the movie
I'm not trying to defend the entire movie, but their being advanced didn't bother me
That's how the world works today, the people in power today are only in power because they were lucky enough to have enough of the right resources to exploit and take advantage of
The idea is geographic luck, they were lucky enough to get vibranium to arrive at those advances
Because it literally is a concession that they aren't unique, they were just lucky enough to get vibranium and use it
I actually really like that vibranium exists though, and that's why they are advanced
They could have used the aesthetic, theres nothing wrong with that, its just they made it everything, it wasn't just an aesthetic
which kind of ruined it
they could have actually have explored how a society would look if it was incredibly advanced, instead they opted for catering to the lowest common denominator
But like
yeeeh
Like those two ideas clashed
Also, one of my biggest problems was the primitive tribal practices combined with &quot;the most advanced society on earth&quot; thing
for no good reason
literally everyone just fought each other
Like, the end of the movie
It meandered a bit too much and made strange decisions
it was ok to watch
Yeah, black panther really wasn't crazy
jett confirmed kkk member

Moon Sugar Records' up-and-coming rapper Lydia (stylized as LYDIA) really loves trappin'. In a new banger produced by Whiterun's very own beatsmith $eptims, the rapper lays smoking hot bars about her love for the trap. In a recent interview with Drums 1 Tamriel, where her single off of the fabled upcoming &quot;Burdens&quot; EP premiered worldwide, Lydia discussed how she could end her beef with the fellow rapper Nazeem (whose &quot;Clouds&quot; EP is in the making), Maven Black-Briar and her producer collective, TheBlackBriiars. &quot;Burdens&quot; EP is set for a release in early 4E 207.

Brockhampton's Saturation 3 is a modern masterpiece that warps the conventions of modern hip-hop and challenges mainstream styles. With its usage of unique beats and social commentary on the plight of negroes in America it delivers insightful revelations and entertaining sounds with uncompromising verve. Kevin Abstract leads the charge on this installment with his clean and direct lyrics, with Merlyn bringing up the rear with his perspective on social expectations and dealing with them while achieving dreams.

See, but jumanji wasn't being serious
But it wasn't terrible

OST
this is another song from the OSt
I didn't think I'd like it, but I was surprised because they actually didn't go as hard on the rap to other genre ratio I thought they would
Like one song was an interlude and it was this kind of techno afro pop thing
listening to the entire soundtrack is pretty good, because it gives you a range of styles not just rap
that one was like one of the few rap songs
that's why I liked it
rap

You guys excited for the new han solo movie?
Supposedly, the majority of conversations the Coens had with Jeff Bridges during the making of The Big Lebowski was whether or not The Dude had gotten high before the scene, and that’s pretty much it.
And the newer game can't be considered better than the older game because its not contemporary to the older game
Right, but what I'm saying is, its stupid to say a newer game is better than an older game because that older game was cutting edge for that time.
Because I thought about it
Is it fair to compare older games to newer games?
Guys

You subhuman baboon. You literal nigger.

How dare you speak, you swarthy jungle monkey. How dare you open your big lipped, rim encrusted, menthol cigarette smelling mouth?

You are human trash, Diego Tyrone LeShawn de Maradona. Universally despised, derided and mocked. Your nationality and skin tone offers no hope to the world that South America can ever prosper. Crawl back in to the Brazilian jungle you came out of, you literal orangutan.

I hope you decide to sail your grandfathers skip to the Falklands and rape some sheep, as is in the negroes nature. It would still be the whitest pussy you ever had. Give Nigel and Robert a chance for some target practice, your sole use to the world. Argentinians obsession with a few windswept islands in the Atlantic is hilarious but sad. Coincidentally its the only worthwhile contribution Argentina has made to the medical field. The MUH LAS MALVINAS sentiment in the average negro Argentinian is both an early warning sign of autism in children, and early on set Alzheimer's in adults.

Take your black hairy fingers off your keyboard, and never talk about the human species again, you mockery of our supposed shared ancestor.. No amount of olive oil and wheat flour slabbed on your face every morning will make you white. It's about as delusional of an idea as your daydreams of European heritage.

You nigger.

You make Bolivia look like a beacon of civilisation.

You are the Baltimore of South America.

Go fertilise the pampas with you and your families corpses, its the best you can hope for in life. For the first time in your life, nigger, you have a job making food for beings vastly superior to yourself. Uruguayan cattle. Coincidentally, it would be the first time an Argentinian &quot;man&quot; provided for a family.

Die, Diego. No one would miss you. Except for Australian Aboriginals, who now would have no one to make them look good.

I think Campbell was largely correct in that there are underlying universal themes that transcend cultural boundaries
Georgie boy strikes again
“In the three decades since I discovered The Hero with a Thousand Faces, it has continued to fascinate and inspire me. Joseph Campbell peers through centuries and shows us that we are all connected by a basic need to hear stories and understand ourselves. As a book, it is wonderful to read; as illumination into the human condition, it is a revelation.”

I'm not trollin David, I'm just speaking the #sponsored truth
Culture 2 is the synthesis of years of work and effort on the part of the Atlanta-based rap trio, Migos, to deliver a product that far exceeds the expectations of fans and Critics alike. In keeping with this idea, Migos has crafted an 106 minute album that subverts expectations and deviates from the established formula for mainstream rap. Their use of cerebral vocabulary and evocative imagery combine to give listeners an experience unlike any other. The use of creative word play and unorthodox instrumentals works together to cement their position as the &quot;shapers of the culture&quot;. Their understated personalities and shy charm sets them apart from their contemporaries as does their innovative style. Culture 2 explores new topics like how much wealth they have accrued from their careers and the lavish lifestyles they live due to that; in addition to their sale of cocaine to build a capital base to allow them to launch their rap careers. All in all, the album is a smash hit and deserves to be quintuple platinum a million times over.
Culture 2 is better than Culture

alright guys, when are we all free for Memelo's campaign extravaganza
He waddled into the room, &quot;do you kno we dey&quot; he said. The terrified student's faces slowly turned to confusion and curiosity, everyone in the library looked at each other. Their minds were racing, until they were slightly calmed by focusing on a girl who had crawled out from her hiding spot and was standing in front of Knuckles. Sweat was rolling from her forehead, but she finally spoke after what seemed like a few minutes- &quot;teach me your ways&quot; she said. Knuckles gazed at her with squinty eyes, after clicking his tongue and summoning the rest of his tribe, they all roared &quot;TE QUEEN&quot; proclaiming the student as their new queen.

The girl was shocked, but she slowly realized what had happened, for she knew of the way her whole life. The library was silent, she could hear the other student's breathing. She looked at the a pair of students under the table opposite of where she was originally hiding, they had bullied her her entire life. The cubicles near the table had other students, all of which who riots in streets naked with megaphones screaming nonsense. She peered back behind her to her new tribe, and with a devilish grin, uttered something to them.

The Knuckles tribe waddled over to the students who were staring wide-eyed and breathing heavily, some of which were starting to cry. &quot;You do not kno de wey&quot; the Knuckles tribe said in unison to the trembling students, and proceeded to violently spit on them with their acidic spit. After what seemed like ages, nothing remained of the students but tattered clothes, melted flesh, and silicon. The girl strutted over to the piles and ransacked for anything she could find, as if looking for something.

After checking the piles she frowned, &quot;it's not here&quot; she muttered. &quot;Tribe, I have one last job for you&quot; she said, the bruddas head's peeked into her direction and listened with the utmost care. After biting her lip and lifting herself off the ground, she said to the tribe &quot;search the rest of the library and classrooms, show anybody you come across de wey.&quot; With a snap of her fingers, the tribes waddled quickly and scattered in all directions. She closed her eyes and heard the screams of others and the clicking and spitting sounds of her tribe, she smiled.﻿

Join the Juul Fools
He's paying respects you baboon
&quot;Don't be a fucking loser&quot; - Imaqtpie 2018
I wish I was
first
let me complete something fiest
That triggered the Vietnam flashbacks I don't have
corridor creep these juul nuts haHAA
then take the fattest hit in the universe
and then make a matching juul of the same size
turn the entire planet into a juul pod
Alright, lets percolate this
and open your mouth and light up
drink it
Buy a half gallon of gasoline
Go to the pump
Go to the gastation
Eat them
You buy $900 worth of juul pods
Ok ok, I see it, but stick this in your pipe and smoke it
and inhale the fumes
and then light it on fire
put in $450 worth of juul pods into it
you take an actual bowl
Try this on for size
and take the fattest rip
then you put them into the bowl
then you take 6 juuls
You take a bong
I got a better idea
yeh
Koreans enjoying grilled meat and alcohol in the 18th century
alright kneegro
Just looking at his face gave me that MMM to get it poppin
I really want to play a game of league with Dualtwin now
YeH
&quot;That's racist&quot;
unto which Dualtwin replied
&quot;thou art a super negro&quot;
And sayeth him unto Dualtwin
Its just like the parable of Memelo the Dank
I was thinking it was Juul pods with the essence of Dualtwin instead of nicotine
Lets begin by first defining what is a JuulDual pod is
EGGcellent
ULU

GET OUT
that one is an eggcellent one
He knew all about the plot before even reading the script

8. The First Order are terrible villains, like absoloutely hilariously bad, they are bumblingly incompetent to the point where I have to ask how they even got past the starting line. Yes the Empire could be hilariously incompetent but they felt like a genuine threat. Darth Vader got shit done, the Emperor got shit done, and Grand Moff Tarkin had a genuine commanding presence and aura of authority to him. With the First Order, Hux is a fucking joke and while I like Kylo alot, he is not going to be able to function as a main villain, he can't lead an army and he's a shitty and inept leader, I think that's part of why he's as good as he is as a character, but as a main villain and a threat to the protaganists? No. The only two people in the First Order who felt threatening in the slightest were Snoke and Phasma, and they are both killed off hilariously easily. All we have left now is Hux and Kylo, both of whom are terrible leaders. 

9. The Resistance are terrible good guys. The entire movie just felt like the Resistance and the First Order attempting to out-stupid each other, one military blunder after another. The only reason Holdo's plan failed was because she didn't tell Poe, if she did, DJ wouldn't have been on the Supremacy to tell the FO about the shuttles. Poe wasn't a mook either, he was fairly high ranked, and considering he managed to convince the others to mutiny he had a fairly high standing in the Resistance. Also they were going faster than the pursuing fleet, couldn't they just send some ships out to go get more fuel and just keep outrunning the star destroyers until they're too far away to track and then just jump away? That would've saved the fleet or at the very least the Raddus itself. Over the course of the film Holdo's ineptitude causes the entire Resistance to be killed off. Also the bombers in the opening are absoloute trash, a squadron of Y-Wings or B-Wings could've done the exact same thing much easier. 
and finally, probably the most important point... 

10. I have zero interest in what happens in the next movie now. The First Order are led by morons, the Resistance is practically wiped out, Quite frankly the galaxy is fucked. Rey knows jackshit about the Jedi, there's no way she can rebuild the order. She's going to make all of the exact same mistakes Luke did. Kylo and Hux are idiots. There's no way they're going to be able to maintain control over an army like that. We've essentially just got a worse version of the Original Trilogy now, only the Empire idiots and the Rebels have little more than the dirt under their boots. I don't envy JJ Abrams right now, no matter how hard he tries to fix this, there is no way he's going to be able to salvage this trainwreck. Episode 9 is going to be a dumpster fire, the whole movie is going to collapse under it's own weight, it might even take the entire franchise down with it. Mark my words, The Last Jedi may have some serious issues, but it will practically be a masterpiece compared to Episode 9. 

I know this was long, but that's my two cents on the matter. 

IHE, on the miniscule chance you actually see this, you're still one of my favourite youtubers, and yes, it is fucking stupid to insult other people over a fucking movie, no hard feelings, I just needed to get my thoughts on the matter out into the open.﻿
4. The worldbuilding is terrible, and as someone who really appreciates good worldbuilding this absoloutely guts me and the lack of internal consistency makes it hard for me to get invested in the story, this isn't really a Rian Johnson problem TFA had this issue as well (though to be fair it wasn't as bad). In TFA it's established that the First Order is a small but fanatical and extremely dedicated remnant of the Empire that was destroyed in ROTJ, the vast majority of the galaxy is under the governance of the New Republic with the FO as a fringe group of extremist insurgents, led by a mysterious new dark side user only known as Snoke, meanwhile the NR doesn't take the threat seriously so Leia leads here own strike force known as &quot;The Resistance&quot; to take the fight to them. Sounds like a great setup doesn't it? What do they with this? In TFA, the First Order somehow manage to pull ANOTHER even BIGGER death star out of their asses and then blast the NR's capital planet to pieces. Ignoring the question of how they managed to make a weapon that big or that powerful, it then gets destroyed comically easily by a tiny fleet. Naturally one would assume that this would be a Pearl Harbour or even 9/11 style event to the New Republic, where they become well too aware of the threat and public outcry moves the New Republic to retaliate with full force. Going into this film I wanted to see the full scale war between the New Republic (spearheaded by Leia's Resistance) and the First Order. I go into the movie expecting a conflict grander and bigger in scale than the war in the OT and what do I get? The first line of the movie is &quot;THE FIRST ORDER REIGNS&quot;, apparently in the 5 or so minutes between the two movies the First Order managed to take over the entire galaxy without a fight. What? WHAT!??!?!? You're seriously telling me that everyone just kinda said &quot;yeah ok welcome back Empire&quot;, yes the NR's capital is destroyed but there were plenty of extremely wealthy and powerful planets that could easily hold their own and maybe even form a coalition against the FO. Instead the slate has been wiped clean for another boring-ass small band of Rebels vs big evil Empire storyline, which was already perfected in the OT, this is literally going around in circles. Oh also they have an even bigger Super Star Destroyer just to add insult to injury. 

5. There's no focus for the trilogy. It's come out now that nobody ever had an idea for where to take this trilogy from the start, in fact Rian Johnson hadn't even seen TFA until AFTER he started writing TLJ, there's no coherent vision, even in the Prequels George knew where he wanted to take the story from the start. Everyone involved in this trilogy, Rian Johnson, JJ Abrams and some people from Lucasfilm should've sat down and decided at the start &quot;Oke doke, here's what we're gonna do, characters start at X and they end at Y, the journey from X to Y is very flexible and you can do whatever you want for the next 3 movies, but we need to get them to THIS end-point&quot;. As it stands, there is a TON of dropped plot points and disconnects between the two movies, at the very least RJ should've at least kept Abrams around to just advise on this and that. There's quite a few examples of this, but my personal favourite is why did Luke leave the map if he didn't want to be found? Also the Knights of Ren were teased in EP. VIII but they just don't show up in this. This is also Abram's fault as well though, in fact it's pretty much the entirety of Lucasfilm's fault altogether, the Lucasfilm story group was set up to make sure all new star wars content was consistent, and they've failed utterly at that. I think RJ actually did a fairly ok job with what he was given, and I do not envy JJ's task of cleaing up this massive fucking mess in Episode 9. You could say that they're paying the price for their lack of vision. 

6. It renders the OT completely moot and pointless. Luke becomes an asshole and Han and Leia divorce, oh and then Han dies. The New Republic they helped build is destroyed in one hit and now the First Order rules everything again. Oh and if Rey attempts to rebuild the Jedi she is doomed to fail, if Luke fucking Skywalker couldn't do it then there is no way she can. The New Republic that the OT crew fought so hard to restore was a bureacratic shit-show (in the books this is shown in detail that it's a corrupt failing mess) that was annihilated in one shot, the Rebellion is now a dozen people and the Millennium Falcon, I would say we've gone right back to A New Hope, but even in A New Hope the Rebels had more people and ships and there were more Jedi alive. 

7. I still think Mark Hamill hates this movie, yeah he took it back but I think he really just didn't want to fuel a giant hate mob forming against the movie. If you look at the way he talks in interviews it's very clear he's obviously disappointed with the way things have turned out, the way his demeanor just sinks whenever he talks about it is honestly really depressing. Obviously I can't tell what's going through his head, but personally there's alot more evidence one way than the other.
Disclaimer: I don't have anything against IHE, he's still one of my favourite youtubers, he's very polite and well spoken for a guy called I Hate Everything, i'm just throwing my two cents in here tbh. 

I absoloutely despised TLJ, no hard feelings or anger really, but I wanted to explain my point of view and why I think it's just kind of a trainwreck: 

1. I actually agree with alot of the defenses here, the soundtrack and performances were great, and in fact this is probably the best looking star wars film. I just think there's alot more wrong with the movie. The usage of the force doesn't bother me either, Luke's projection ability is relatively tame compared to some of the batshit insane crap that's being pulled in the expanded universe (there's an old comic where Palpatine uses the force to open a fucking wormhole and another sith lord Naga Sadow causes a sun to fucking supernova using the force, and don't get me started on Darth Nihilus the one-man-planet-killer). As for Kylo he's honestly the only character I give a shit about anymore, the scenes where he's talking with Rey are some of the best in the movie. I did not go into this film wanting to hate it, I don't go into films wanting to hate them, if I don't think i'm going to get any enjoyment out of them I don't watch them. Also the Throne room scene is absoloutely brilliant, it's the best scene in the whole movie. I hated the Battle of Crait, but that's only because of how much better the Throne Room was in comparison. 

2. When it comes to the physics, it's not the fact that it's unrealistic that bugs me, it's that it's not internally consistent. Internal consistency is, IMO, far more important than realism in alot of cases when it comes to worldbuilding, I don't care if their's sound in space as long as there is always sound in space for example. The problem with TLJ's physics isn't that they're unrealistic, it's that they go against previously established in-universe logic. The bombers in the opening aren't bad because they're unrealistic, they're bad because in the OT the rebels had far better bombers (Y-Wings and B-Wings, even Rogue One got this right) that could do the exact same job much better than these newer ones, the film isn't bad because it defies real life logic, it's bad because it defies previously established star wars logic, it's the same with the stupid chase between the fleets, we've seen cannons able to fire at much further distances before, plus the First Order must have HUNDREDS of fighters on board that fleet, if they deployed all of them the Resistance ship would be annihilated in a matter of minutes. It'd be like if they made a Lord of the Rings movie where someone breaks the one ring with their bare hands. 

3. Luke, I hated what they did to Luke. It's not the fact that he failed at rebuilding the order, it's not even the fact that he tried to kill Kylo Ren, it's the fact that he ran away like a little bitch without even warning anyone that Kylo, an extremely powerful dark side user. was on the loose. I actually really like the idea of Luke getting overconfident and fucking up in a huge way like that, and then having to come to terms with that. It is perfectly in character for Luke to make a stupid impulsive fuck-up in a panic like that, but it's also in his character to do everything that he could to fix it, to atone for his mistakes and deal with the monster he created. Luke didn't learn from his failure, he didn't even try to do anything to fix it, he ran away and hid like a little bitch, and the only reason he did that was because the script needed him to so Rey could show up and fix everything years later. Luke's arc isn't one of learning from his failure, if it was he would've picked himself up much sooner and confronted Kylo/Ben, but he doesn't do that, he sits around, does nothing and then Rey comes along later and basically just fixes everything for him.

it honestly just seems like pandering
how does him being gay contribute in any way to his development as a character or make him any different than to how he was before
but now hes gay and edgy
varus' story is revenge with a bow
that's a tilt and a half
AND THEY DIDNT EVEN REWORK HIM
I felt like his lore was fine, and then they utterly gutted it and made it infinitely more convoluted than it needed to be to get the point across
were incredibly uninspired
the varus lore rewrites
oh yeah
they practically say, it would be bad if they did something with those nukes
also, its retarded that there was an entire section of the U-boat they just found that happens to be massive and also have nukes
its acutally kind of tilting how squishy you are considering you are wearing power armor
yeeeeeeee
haven't
I really have got that far
im still in the U-boat at the very beginning
and remind them I'm a member of the merchants guild ✡️( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)✡️
ill find the head writer and send them an angry email
someone needs to pay for this
that is truly unforgiveable

oh eggggggcellent
Nothing wrong with a bit of cucking
I like that part too

Like it wasn't very satisfying
and they like tell all that with a cinematic and then just cut to him being freed and then say DLC LuL
well, the ending for talion was basically he becomes a ringwraith, but then gets freed when Frodo destroys the ring
but like, the ending was ok, they just like basically say at the end that the story is complete for talion but there will be 2 other dlc that continue the story
focus
but yeah, the story isn't the foucs
eggcellent dota 2 meme
the ending for Shadow of War was ok

Almost as ridiculous as the new Mercedes Benz E-Class Sedan.
The most intelligent E-Class family of all time welcomes a powerful new member to the dynasty. The E400 Sedan model arrives this year, boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque — the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury.
Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips — even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. &quot;Car-to-X&quot; Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles — effectively allowing it to &quot;see&quot; around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems — including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC®, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist — feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them.
Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display, while touch controls, aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once. It's a vehicle that demands to be driven, and more than lives up to the dream.
Look for the E400 4MATIC Sedan at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter, with an MSRP of $58,900.﻿
Waiting for Midas mode has been ridiculous.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Hentai. The romance is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of tentacle physics most of the &quot;action&quot; will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the nuanced idea of feminimity, which is deftly woven into the visuals - the japanese philosophy of censorship really puts emphasis on imagination. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these ideas, to realize that they're not just erotic - they say something deep about human sexuality. As a consequence people who dislike Hentai truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the eye opening nature of watching Yaoi as a straight male, which only a true intellectual could appreciate without any form of arousal. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as a quintessential part of japanese culture unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a tentacle rape tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

Monkey King Aghs upgrade: Monkey King's brilliant prowess in brewing allows him to open up his bar, called the Monkey King Bar. Any enemy hero in a nearby radius will give 1500 gold to the Monkey King because they will buy his beer and wine. They will also get a half duration Drunken Haze. If a hero can't afford it, they go into debt, granting Monkey King the Monkey King Bar effects on that specific hero until the next time Monkey King uses the ability and they can actually afford it.
It's an instant cast spell with an 800 radius. 100 second cooldown.
Note: Brewmaster pays double and does not get the Dunken Haze effect.

What defines a living legend? Is it the countless world-breaking achievements they've gathered throughout the ages? The wondrous feats and acts of absolute marvel they've performed for the masses to spectate in sheer bewilderment? Or is it the benevolent love and warm recollection received from every other organism that exists on this rock we call Earth until the days of recorded history meets its end? There's only one way to find out, and that's right here, right now...

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

Why is IMAQTPIE such an extraordinarily good player? One might think it's because of his unparalleled reflexes or his deepest understanding of every single detail and its impact on the game. The truth is IMAQTPIE is miles ahead of every single player in the competition when it comes down to the memes. He only harvests the freshest and spiciest memes there are, consequently destroying the enemy players with their second hand memes.

Dota 2 is a game that stressed heavily on microagressing your opponents throughout various avenues of play and situations. This can stem from as far back as character selection and team cohesion/composition. It is vital that dota 2 players take advantage of not only counter picking against certain matchups, but also sealing down their own win conditions and strategy for the match overall. When looking at QT and the gangs initial movements and play, they mistepped in so many directions that the game is almost irreparable at this point in time. For one, they have close to no actual comprehension of how their characters work. This alongside the fact that they do not understand the mechanics of crowd control and queueing up abilities will ultimately set them on the path to defeat.
But I think Scarra is why they aren't winning in dotes
especially mid
I prefer early game dota to league because you can make some spicy plays
harassing someone falls under laning
and then grouping late game and team fighting
I mean, league is literally sitting in lane and trying to outfarm your opponent
yeah, its generally about grouping and utilizing your advantages early
yeah, its generally about grouping and utilizing your advantages early
we won a game yesterday with jett as a carry and parsa and I as supports and we carried the shit out of the game
cooperation
yeah, its about team play
that's if you let the enemy get ahead and basically don't grow a brain and try to kill them by grouping and ganking
if you know youll get a kill or two out of it
so its not terrible
I mean, realistically even in league the enemy wont take the tower incredibly fast early in the game
yeah, but like the concepts are the same, its just the medium that's different
like rotating 2 people to a lane early game and ganking is a really easy way to get kills
and coordinating
like grouping for anything
grouping is just like 100x more effective in general in dota
if you want
you can
theyre getting thrashed by the infamous all-pick pudge
and they aren't counter ganking
they aren't grouping
the boys need to group
ye
yeah
IT REQUIRES A MASTAS TOUCH
the movement and attacks take getting use to though
If you think about basic moba mechanics its intuitive
Its not that unintuitive, you just have to think a bit more
he's playing it like league
he just skilled the wrong abilty
noooooooooooooo
they just actually don't know wtf they are doing
they do have backstory
alright you filthy apes

Look at how EFFORTLESSLY pro player Micheal &quot;Imaqtpie&quot; Santana decimates the competition now that Scarra has been removed from the equation, i have read over 300 r/leaugeoflegends threads suggesting that the downfall of deltafox rests on scarra and scarra alone and this game proves E V E R Y T H I N G. If delta fox had listened to reddit pro analysts earlier and cut off the dead weight, maybe Imaqtpie could have had a chance at dragging his team to victory.﻿

Imaqtpie's Wild Ride is a dark ride at Disneyland Park, formerly located at the Magic Kingdom. Originally planned to be a roller coaster, it became a dark ride attraction because Walt Disney only wanted attractions that were appropriate for all ages. It is one of the few remaining attractions that was operational on the park's opening day in 1955 (although the current version of the ride opened in 1983). The ride's story is based on Disney's adaptation of The Wind in the Willows (1908), one of the two segments of the film The Adventures of Ichabod and Imaqtpie (1949). It is currently operating in Fantasyland

In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire Deltafox.

That's my friend from New Zealand adjusting to American culture. He doesn't usually stand on bins, but when he does it's to combat homophobia through a method of humour we enjoy thoroughly called 'sarcasm'. This form of humour was first introduced to New Zealand in the late 2000s through imported copies of Friends and Seinfeld (which can now also be experienced in full colour at local movie theaters).﻿

Many of you out there probably believe fidget spinners are just a toy for kids. You don't know how fucking wrong you are. Fidget spinners were designed for elite athletes, CEOs, and arch-bishops. Kids merely adopted the spinning, we were born in it, moulded by it. I've dedicated my life to fidget spinners. I'm the only truly certified grand master of fidget spinners; 3 time defending world champion WWE belt holder of fidget spinning. So I believe I'm the only one truly qualified to tell you that fidget spinning is a man's sport, a man's man's sport. I was once a boy who became a man thanks to fidget spinning and also natural ageing. Do you wanna know the difference between me and a child? I'm 22 fucking years old, children are usually under 12 depending on what criteria you're gonna use to classify someone as a child so think about that shit next time you see me torpedoing down a slip-and-slide sailing at an atom splitting 68 miles per hour going straight into a fucking brick wall of manliness. How do I stay in top physical form becoming this athletic specimen that scientists can't even fully understand? Well it's all thanks to my work out and diet regimen now it'd make even LeBron James shit his pants. I wake up at 4 am everyday , I drink 3 raw eggs with the side of pancakes with nails sprinkled on top and also a glass of straight uranium, I then grab my favourite fidget spinner: the triple XL gold-plated 25 pound weighted Air-Cutter supreme-extreme maximum turbo overdrive spagooter with pump-action assault-grip as well as extended magazines and a silencer, I've even customised this bad boy with a laser dot sight with a green finish as well as further modifications including hydraulics, 3D printing capability as well as doubling as a fax machine. This is a gadget straight out of MI6, this is right brewed up from fucking Q laboratories- he used to make gadgets for 007 now he's making fidget spinners for me. Do you still think this is a fad for kids you fucking troglodyte? Well I guess if that's how you wanna spin this story, but for me I know the truth, I know that this game was made for men and I've mastered it. I live and breathe fidget spinning. So go ahead, play your boring traditional sports like football and baseball. I'll just be here like a diss-jockey spinning it. Hugh! Sorry about that, just had to dodge another vagina that was just tossed at me, it's not easy being the grand master of fidget spinning.﻿
blessed be, kindred will hopefully become a champion now

and combat can be a buggy piece of shit in this game because they make it follow so many rules and certain things are overly sensitive
Most things in dark souls arent tedious
Because realism generally makes things more tedious
I wouldnt say dark souls is realistic
its not like dark souls realism
because muh realism
The game is terrible, because the characters arent interesting, the writing is really dry, and they lock key aspects of combat behind progressing the main story
But I would keep your day job xd
Thats a good joke

Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream.A murky, forgotten land.A place where shrooms may mend your ailing mind.You will lose everything...... once Branded.The symbol of the stoner.An augur of dankness.Your past. Your future. Your very light.None will have meaning, and you won't even care.By then, you'll be something other than human.A thing that feeds on smoke.A Hollow who tokes.Long ago, in a walled off land, far to the north, a great king built a great kingdom.I believe they called it Angeles National Forest.Perhaps you're familiar.No, how could you be.But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate.Without really knowing why...Like a moth drawn to a flame.Your weed will burn in anguish.Time after time.For that is your fate.The fate of the high.

In the Age of Ancients the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray joints, Ashtrays, and Everlasting Dickheads. But then there was Weed and with weed came disparity. Toke and cough, life and death, and of course, rip and chop. Then from the dank, They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the Weed. Michael, the First of the Dank, The Witch of Memelo and his Daughters of Chops, Mars, the Lord of Lighters, and his faithful stoners. And the Furtive Philip, so easily forgotten.With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dickheads. Mars's mighty tokes peeled apart their thick hides. The Witches weaved great smokestorms. Michael unleashed a miasma of dank and wheeze. And Diego the Thiccness betrayed his own, and the Dickheads were no more.Thus began the Age of Weed. But soon the flames will fade and only Dark will remain. Even now there are only embers, and man sees not weed, but only empty bowls. And amongst the smoking are seen, carriers of the accursed Danksign.Yes, indeed. The Danksign brands the smoking. And in this land, the smoking are corralled and led to the Angeles Forest, where they are locked away, to await the end of the world... This is your fate.Only, in the ancient legends it is stated, that one day an smoking shall be chosen to leave the smoking asylum, in pilgrimage, to the land of ancient lords, Lordran.
In the Age of Ancients the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray joints, Ashtrays, and Everlasting Dickheads. But then there was Weed and with weed came disparity. Toke and cough, life and death, and of course, rip and chop. Then from the dank, They came, and found the Souls of Lords within the Weed. Michael, the First of the Dank, The Witch of Memelo and his Daughters of Chops, Mars, the Lord of Lighters, and his faithful stoners. And the Furtive Philip, so easily forgotten.With the strength of Lords, they challenged the Dickheads. Mars's mighty tokes peeled apart their thick hides. The Witches weaved great smokestorms. Michael unleashed a miasma of dank and wheeze. And Diego the Thiccness betrayed his own, and the Dickheads were no more.Thus began the Age of Weed. But soon the flames will fade and only Dark will remain. Even now there are only embers, and man sees not weed, but only empty bowls. And amongst the smoking are seen, carriers of the accursed Danksign.Yes, indeed. The Danksign brands the smoking. And in this land, the smoking are corralled and led to the Angeles Forest, where they are locked away, to await the end of the world... This is your fate.Only, in the ancient legends it is stated, that one day an smoking shall be chosen to leave the smkoing asylum, in pilgrimage, to the land of ancient lords, Lordran.
yes indeed. it is called lothric where the transitory lands of the lords of cinder converge. in venturing north the pilgrims discovered the truth of the old words: &quot;the fire fades and the lords go without thrones.&quot; when the link of the fire is threatened the bell tolls unearthing the old lords of cinders from their graves... aldrich saint of the deep... farron's undead legion the abyss watchers... and the reclusive lord of the profaned capital yhorm the giant... only in truth... the lords will abandon their thrones... and the unkindled will rise. nameless accursed undead unfit even to be cinder. and so it is that ash seeketh embers

Campaign when?

I mean, he's fairly tame for a thot
I dab on thee
As Duke of the Northeastern Empire
keep up the good work fellas
yeh
Yeah, I don't have a problem with that
I just don't think they should be classified as elves though is what I'm saying, because that doesn't really explain what they are. They seem like they are much more than elves given their capabilities.
yeah, that's what I mean
in the context of this world
I just don't like that they're elves, because that seems strange
I'm really talking about the eladrin at this point
I just think there's a fine line with making something interesting but powerful, and making something grossly overpowered and therefore uninteresting
That just casts them as tragic heroes who did what their gods bid, and doesn't acknowledge all the benefits they get literally just for being elves
Not necessarily
exactly
They're boring because their gifts are a given
That's literally everything I just described though
Yeah, world-threatening threats like rogue gods
I think Parsas quote is actually more descriptive of elves, because elves never had to struggle for what they had, they were born with it and the only time they struggle is when they encounter something that can challenge their inherent power (which is almost always some kind of world-ending apocalypticesque thing)
Elves are many different things to many different people, but it's important to remember the one thing elves always are: better. Better than you, me, and even other elves. Especially other elves.
there's no beating around the bush on that point
Elves are gay

Its literally a western story written by Japanese people
Berserk is the least weebish manga
and Griffith becomes a demon god
When guts loses his arm
It was the demonic one
Caska's was hotter &gt;.&gt;
It was suitably dark for the setting
Yeah
so I'm cool with pretty much anything
I like Berserk
O O F
Theres a fine line to tread in terms of length
that's what I mean
I don't mind the majority of session, but I feel like more than 1 or 2 sessions makes it get boring a bit
By dungeon crawl do you mean long drawn out dungeon dive or just going into a dungeonesque setting in general
is there a third option?
Lul
You subhuman baboon. You literal nigger.

How dare you speak, you swarthy jungle monkey. How dare you open your big lipped, rim encrusted, menthol cigarette smelling mouth?

You are human trash, Diego Tyrone LeShawn de Maradona. Universally despised, derided and mocked. Your nationality and skin tone offers no hope to the world that South America can ever prosper. Crawl back in to the Brazilian jungle you came out of, you literal orangutan.

I hope you decide to sail your grandfathers skip to the Falklands and rape some sheep, as is in the negroes nature. It would still be the whitest pussy you ever had. Give Nigel and Robert a chance for some target practice, your sole use to the world. Argentinians obsession with a few windswept islands in the Atlantic is hilarious but sad. Coincidentally its the only worthwhile contribution Argentina has made to the medical field. The MUH LAS MALVINAS sentiment in the average negro Argentinian is both an early warning sign of autism in children, and early on set Alzheimer's in adults.

Take your black hairy fingers off your keyboard, and never talk about the human species again, you mockery of our supposed shared ancestor.. No amount of olive oil and wheat flour slabbed on your face every morning will make you white. It's about as delusional of an idea as your daydreams of European heritage.

You nigger.

You make Bolivia look like a beacon of civilisation.

You are the Baltimore of South America.

Go fertilise the pampas with you and your families corpses, its the best you can hope for in life. For the first time in your life, nigger, you have a job making food for beings vastly superior to yourself. Uruguayan cattle. Coincidentally, it would be the first time an Argentinian &quot;man&quot; provided for a family.

Die, Diego. No one would miss you. Except for Australian Aboriginals, who now would have no one to make them look good.
