something joshathan sent me&gt; In my oncogenesis class we're learning about cancer and its development. I'm currently watching an interview with a Nobel prize-winning cancer researcher and he said that while many factors can cause cancer--the environment and viruses, to name a few--the most potent cause of cancer known today is this post

Now listen here Jack. I've been in and out of the real deal White House with my good friend, Brock. You don't think I don't know the difference between a fake and... you know... whole White House? Take a knee skippy and let a tried and true man say some words... Like good words and... So there was this time back in '69 when me and my best pal Barraka, we were out in the White House lawn when a tangerine man came running in and starting ruining the whole show. And I said to him... I said... I said now listen here ugly! You better cut that attitude or we're going to have to take this out behind the bleachers. And then he was... he ran off... And America... I'm prepared to do it again. Thank you.

I live in the White House on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on the 1st floor. My name is Joseph Biden. I’m 77 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my arms look s a little skinny, I’ll put on  1940s music while doing my pushups, Jack. I can do a thousand now. After I turn off the music I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I remind people who Obama is. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then a pro-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Joseph Biden. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense I used to be intelligent, I simply am not mentally there.

Suppose you are studying a new type of brain cancer, where the neuronal cells in the brain
proliferate out of control and form a tumor. You obtain a sample of the tumor and study the
tumor cells in the lab. You hypothesize that a gene important in the cell cycle is mutated.
Which of the following are likely candidates that would explain the uncontrolled proliferation
of these cells?
can I ask you something?

were the fucking great ones too scared of Japanimation to go fuck up their world with the old blood
so in this world there were gods from Dark Souls, eldritch old ones from Bloodborne, and fucking N I P P O N from Sekiro
but dark souls happened in the same world too right?

i liked the season finale but it doesnt really do anything to address current developing plotlines
the anime had a solid ending?
thats like saying they shouldnt put ice in water because its a different state of organization blah blah blah
because it exists in another medium i shouldnt enjoy it the way i would like?
why
despite the fact that the anime hasnt explored several plot points that are in the manga? and even less than that in the web comic?
there are a lot
and one punch
fist of the north star is also great
and i dont care if thats from a different anime
You are already reported.
Skypo! Report this fool!
Guess youre really gonna make me break out my STANDO
Oh? You're doubling down on talking shit about Jojo instead of backpeddling and begging for forgiveness?

that new deckpasito is looking pretty good
what fucking opium den was he sleeping in when he wrote that fucking power
especially when he came up with bites the dust 
i will just assume araki was sleep deprived when writing part 4
at least its not retarded like fucking dragonball
every show has its problems with consistency
don't pay too much attention to plot consistency. because araki forgets sometimes 
CRACKA VOLLEY
Jojo. a show about Englishmen. but when that wasn't selling they made it about JAPANTOWN THANK YOU NIPPON
KONO DIO DA

my favorite jojos are not the highschoolers mind you
that's a very important part of the show
and 17 year old high schoolers who are built like Olympian athletes
back when hamon was a thing and when people in stupid looking clothes weren't screaming about ENEMY STANDOS
what part miles? I think youre starting with phantom blood right?
Oh? youre approaching him? Instead of running away?
I did get the lowest tho
that is actually not true as multiple others got sub 30
also eric don't fucking accuse people of shit you yourself are guilty of. just because youre the only one who fervently denies his rampant autism doenst mean youre actually right
ive been watching a ton of southpark recently and now everytime I type eric I just see cartman
didn't call japan developing eric
because that's retarded
I don't think the cultural standards of developing nations should be what youre trying to emulate
japan truly has a national resource. grown women who sound like children. thanks sseth
wow that's terrible
fuck it
skype makes gifs fucking impossible
girls don't exist
not so youre not perving on an underaged 2d grill
is that the reason?
welcome to nippon. get your shit together
learn to parry idiots
fromsoft is tired of you retards dodge rolling out of everything
game is hard
I beat the wolf but the fuckin corvian knight still kills me
so I fucked off and beat the abysswatchers in one try
the corvian knight or the bigass wolf keep fucking killing me
im stuck on my current playthrough
youre like the ricardo of this groupchat
michael
because I never did
and I was sad
then he got gud
back then he sucked as much as I did
I met Michael in 6th grade violin class
45ish
his winrate is pretty low rn
also drow ranger pog
oh god im not ready for another bristleback like passive
so i can actually run the damn thing
i fixed my graphics card problem
put up or shut up boi
game is ahrd
played 4 games and got shit on on all 4 of them
i reinstalled apex legends
Ricardo Milos is fuckin GREAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
like... a real oldie
this is an oldie
HERE COMES THE MONEY
fuckin when
I love having my shit stolen
It didn’t really show us much of anything. But hey if my boy reynauld is back I’m game
No
Eww
Forgot the damn things name
The only starter whose look I liked was the emperor penguin 
no
umm
the starters look ugly as all hell
idk
it looked... more of the same
I saw the sword and shield announcement and
so theres that
well... you cant Naruto run hash into cities tho
kenshi looks like wonky mount and blade imo
That’ll make one B I G BORGAR
Dio best husbando

THANK YOU RICARDO
what is your stando powah?
game is hard
Dankest Dungeon 2: Eldritch Boogaloo
The comments section was spicy 
Might be cool the first game was fun
For the like maybe 2 other people in this chat that played the darkest dungeon, red hook studios announced they are making another one
and i have no fucking clue what i should do
so it didn't help with my framerate problems
im not really planning on playing
im just seeing if reinstalling windows fixed my lag problem
im already in a game
i don't remember doing that
why would I tell you about a hero's voiceline?
the joke is the hero has a voice line: &quot;Wolves need no armor&quot;
I watched the video days ago
guess wolves do need armor
Sick agi gain too
ofc hes fucking broke
he lives in LA and isn't some big ticket streamer
jesus fuck has anyone else been dealing with fucking disgusting framerate issues since a windows update?
who's that handsome devil?
LAKAT MATATAAAAAAAAAAG
absolutely horrendous
mars and I had the most miserable experience trying to play apex legends together
and that was that
i just tried to shoot people then an ulting bloodhunter ran around the corner at light speed
but i didnt fucking use any of that
i get that the draw is that characters have abilities and shit
yeah
i got second place
ill play one game before i fuck off
i installed it to give it a try
well im glad it means that much to you
nothing beats the blink slammer
they patched this cancer
I heard about that
Muh realism
hes still on the Minecraft hunger games grind
wise words from midormeepo
5hours for small patches, 3minutes to get into a relationship, Purge has his priorities right﻿
thanks purge
that's great
what the fuck am I supposed to see?
they are working on it
Mars you are being exceptionally stupid
How about this
Maybe by not being direct I’m short circuiting his brain
Isn’t an opinion by definition a not completely factual statement
There is a pattern to speech mars
Is mars attempting insightful discourse by dribbling on his monitor and randomly slapping keys on his keyboard?
I’m more thinking about triple a titles like metro 
I think it’s fine
Twitch literally prints money for them
just... don't fucking make a games platform its not that easy
gj epic games you know how to support one game
BR games print money for like 3 months before they are eclipsed... unless they constantly update their game
so
apex legends got no marketing, got like 1000000 players their first day
titanfall had no marketing and died
think of it like this
did you play it mars?
it is free btw
and hes great so sure ill listen to him
is a tweet from STAR_
Apex Legends is a good example of not giving people the time to complain about video games before they release.
I think
apex is titanfall for people who actually want to play a game that's not like 3 years dead
its dumb
people just keep leaving the que
whomst?
<ss type="confused">:/</ss>
does it have great postgame?
fucking trolls
bring back iron talon and skeleton king

I have to patch tho

but then again I cant remember 5 minutes ago so I doubt anything would jog my memory
not really narrowing it down
umm
whomst?
some bullshit about the epic games platform
I heard about that
yeah
i don't think so
I watched 5 seconds and was confused by their terminology enough to make me want to shoot myself
how vile
I think its going on the epic games platform
metro exodus is not coming to steam right?
emitter. hisoka said they are quick to lose their shit for small inconveniences.
what the fuck is the button
I never really looked at jotoros hat
not the fucking character who is 2 gay men in a weapon possessed body who keep the demon weapon from committing genocide with the power of their love?
that's the lore that puts you over the edge?

O K
MAGIC S U C K S
I’m glad to have facilitated this meeting so you all can adequately plan out your Wednesday jamboree.
In front of the theater
I’m there
im with it
should I eat before or after
im taking b12
and you deserve a trophy
because spamming skype auto responses is the peak of comedy
and we wont come to a consensus in time
but I feel like this was too sudden
then plan around that
we just have to pick a time and get some tickets
I don't think it matters
should we?
umm
have we worked out a time for tuseday to see the movie?
im good for it
have we got a time?
i prefer tuseday
have we decided on a day?
ive got something im going to at 6:30 in hawthorne
and only early wednesday
im good for tuseday
I am
but I think its a ways away for milo
its not too far for me
after Wednesday the theater in westwood is showing all the way til sunday
google search shows showtimes up till this sunday
in the westwood village
a place called iPic on Wilshire blvd
Thursday a theatre is westwood is playing it
not any nearby
do yall want to try to organize it for tuseday or Wednesday? or let it pass it up
the thing is its only showing for the next two days
mhmmm
so its pretty early to be thinking about it
i mean my birthday is the 2nd
so whats the play?
yall like aquaman right?
aquaman is showing in amc 7 after
i mean...
i donno
but I think amc 7 is going to have its last showing of it this wednesday
idk when showtimes are
and that was one that I was interested in too
I haven't either
do you have a movie in mind?
are yall interested in something like that?
fucking emoji
eww
like some big group date
just go to third street for dinner and a movie
its my birthday soon and I want to know if yall are interested in doing the same thing we did last year
also ankles

thank you SirActionSlacks! very cool
I will also be coming home friday
and no she doesn't lose everything at the end of DwD
you mean... storytelling?
…. a character experiencing conflict along her path to achieving her goals?
so youre up to date. what is a plot that you feel has been resolved poorly
where are you in the song of ice and fire rn?
I've fallen into the trap that ive been telling other people to avoid. Attempting to reason with a piece of paper with only one thing written on it is useless. 
how does the fact that the series is unconcluded as of rn mar the content currently out there?
instead you gave me... a vampire novel set in the US?
you haven't given me an unclosed plotline in GOT yet
having an ending without ongoing conflict is bad
a conclusion to the series only has to wrap up the main plot not every subplot in the story
i doubt that tbh. he has to write 2 more books
and i know nothing about it
that's not GOT.
what unwrapped plotline are you referring to right now?
numbers?
….
i don't see GOT as a rip
and I read part of the romance of the 3 kingdoms. 
fucking starcraft was supposed to be a licensed 40k game
most of blizzard games' settings are rips from GW properties
who got his material from folklore
most fantasy settings are rips from Tolkien
like... every story ever?
because it has source material?
rn youre trying to tell me that the story sucks because you don't like it
if you want to make a point you don't begin by calling the other a retard.
and not an issue with the writing or story telling
which sounds like a personal problem
being the oldest child of ned stark. oh hey another lawful good protagonist
she is valued as a commodity not as a person
and I hate it
arya has plot armor
that I agree with
and having story arcs depicting different characters with different motivations is... how a story is written
not a mary sue
she is married to one of the most amoral characters in the show and is later raped by THE most amoral character in the show
she doesn't have everything given to her nor does she have obscene natural gifts
shes not a mary sue
oh you mean jon fucking snow
not having a lawful good protagonist?
O K
and he doesn't like the author's work ethic
if I remember correctly eric doesn't like the series because... it has source material...
well after season 4 the writers of the show just... kinda winged it
euron was a thing
its releasing its final season this summer
soon tm
got ends next season
when brann deadpan narrated
6
and it culminated to that fucking pointless ending
the entire season was like.... a season where actions have no consequences
I don't agree with you mars
season 7 was dumb
what about it?
uhh
fuckin 2000 games on kunkles
sorry I cant play kunkka like fucking !attacker
… id rather have internet
id rather have internet
I wouldn't trade 70s for now

I thought it looked more like borderlands than anything else
you give onto me depression
how dreadful michael
no
umm
but not for the next hour
maybe later today
also still no
but not what the fuck we do with the stuff
i mean they always say we gotta get the bread
YEAH
uhh
im going to go hang myself in my closet for making that joke
i didn't even have to rise and grind for it
i got this bread
i mean
what the fuck am I going to do with them
I now have about... 3 loaves of baked bread in my apartment now
so no
for some reason.
baking
parents are in my dorm
cease
fuckin
which kinda sucks
also theres a BR game mode
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh we're swamped with hackers now
fuck
because that's a thing apparently
none of that hydrogen shit either
and dont fucking tell me youre driving a tesla get the fuck out
and stay there
put your mouth around your car's exaust
exit this building
ah yes... the most heroic quality of giving someone a cleft lip for one comment about his hair
or he will literally disfigure you for life
dont mess up his hair
don't mind me ill just be cleaning up this heresy
ahhhhhh well...
I thought it was called crazy diamond
literally no jojo has both mom and dad
why the fuck every jojo only have one parent
and josuke is like a 15 year old brat
Joline sucks
also there is one female jojo
supposed to be male characters
those are

nope
nope

like peta
that brings about more problems...
it is the most chad
you are wrong michael
such a thing cannot be allowed to happen as I and  I alone can be the most perfect human
as the spawn would surely attempt to rival my greatness
would never allow myself to reproduce
as the perfect human
i
no
so
if anything kira has the highest record of exterminated thots in the entire fucking series
that's making an assumption im not comfortable with
how
fucking
also kira is great fuck those jojo douches
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh dio did nothing wrong
you go to hell and you die
you go to hell
awful
fucking
Joesph has both character and an abundance of heroic qualities
The pillar men were weird so we’re ignoring them
But honestly fuck those guys DIO and KIRA for life
Therefore he isn’t a joestar
To be a joestar you have to either have no character or a minimal amount of heroic traits
I have a different path to get to the same conclusion
How does color affect ones perception on whether a fight is boring or not
watching dota is fucking great
watching dota tho
actually boring
watching overwatch tho
playing overwatch is.... ehhh
kira is fucking great
except kira
also part 4 big gay
who uses his powers to permanently mar peoples faces when they make fun of his hair
YOUR MOM GAY
fuck your pompadour lookin ass hair
and fuck his dumbass hair
josuke
fuck
that exist
things
the rest are
ok the third one is an actual fucking hat
what the FUCK
where does the fucking hair start and hat end?
Also Varus is actually two gay guys who hold back the murderous impulses of a sentient weapon with their love
Kill maim burn and all that good stuff

but hey its just a link for now
and here's me thinking sharing that video with you wont result in a deluge of porn in the skype chat
I hate this

I didnt

its mistaking ignorance for innocence
nature being more pure and civilization/institution being corrupting and all that
that's the whole premise behind noble savage

Jungle hippies w/ animal parts
Vastayans are just riots attempt at portraying the noble savage archetype 
Schlept
Game balance is harder
Game is hard
I’m thinking ugh it’s this fucker again taking my damn camps
Like when I see ivern I’m not thinking OH BOY a nonstandard jungler
Or she’ll be a stupid gimmick like ivern 
I think she might bring some spice in a game
Fuck that
The only way I see it is if she turns into a tank and the assassin looking at her is like

invalid
I noticed that
strokes of brilliance like this make me wonder how you haven't suffocated yourself with a plastic bag
impressive logic eric
well im sure waiting 40 min to be kicked repeatedly is a more enjoyable experience

I actually don't see your answer mars
you lost?
mars never answered my question
Bru-jeh?
how do you say that phonetically?
mars did you lose yet?
so its solely a competition between myself and the individual I challenged?
am I still subject to the penalty we agreed on?
and I fail later on into the month

are we all still in the game?

Will you hold that to the other two or is your selective blindness preventing that

you don't want your players feeling like they are just strapped into the ride and have no control over where they are going

single-minded characters are easier to play, and maybe more enjoyable.
I think multifaceted characters don't work in dnd. because its too hard to focus on so many sides

not have someone thrust theirs upon them

Can either of them makea da good spaghett?
I just want spaghett 
After the fights the gladiators would enjoy spaghett w/ fake blood
It was all wooden swords and tomato paste
Back in Rome, gladiators didn’t actually kill eachother
What does that mean?
you could just not play ranked
VERY SNEAKY
&quot;I Understand&quot;
I beat you to it jett
Nigga moment?
Based on your deranged ramblings from yesterday I’d say we already have a lot to draw conjecture from
such loud professions of autism have never been heard as they have now.

fucking seriously?
CYKA
what does skype have to say about that?
CYKA BLYAT
also the phone version is broken
it asked me a bunch of questions
... he’s not responding. I guess he already started
Next question is will you get legally shitfaced?
Can mars get legally shitfaced?
To possess such potent autism... you must be a marvel to behold.

I haven't played the game if youre referring to me
which doesn't speak to my preferences
i should point out that they are only recommended as &quot;popular among friends&quot;
I still violently hate how milf and hentai are games being &quot;recommended&quot; to me
&quot;Fancier the food, the closer it is to eating a human. That's all rich people want to do.&quot;
I’m probably going to be a few minutes late
I called him stupid and he didn't respond. I guess that means he agrees
Lol
Anyone want to go get dinner tonight?
Axe is axe.
Because you two played that hentai game, steam recommended it as “trending among friends”
Fortnite?
one of these things is not like the other. one of these things just doesn't belong.
I saw the gameplay trailer and didn't see anything about that
Autism

At least it’s not another fucking Warcraft hero
Before Arcturus fucking why 
i don't know what you sent but im assuming you accidentally activated your niBBer macro again
umm sorry guys turns out we don't know what the fuck we're doing. enjoy more assassin buffs. time to kill has been reduced to 0.3 seconds for every character in the game.
But it’s everyone’s consensus that nameless king is cancer

The red bit runs all the way up my arms and that unburnt part was where my watch was
Yesterday I went biking with my dad for 5 hours
for the three  people who regularly play
but it was the most self contained game in the series
ik technically all those queens are shards of manus, who you killed in the first game and the world is still in the throws of gwyn setting himself on fire and demanding other dipshits to do the same (dark lord for life)
ds2 plot was, by far, the most isolated from what happens in the other games
that's mostly a ds3 thing
AND FUCKING HELL EVERYONE AND THEIR FUCKING MOTHERS WERE EXPECTING MENGSK
but FUCKING GOD DAMN IT ANOTHER WARCRAFT HERO
I mean the kit is cool
what do you think of whitemane?
youre actually right just replace 8ft tall fungus people with humans
gorkamorka?

While looking I found some other stuff

Hey guys I know this goes way back but does anyone have the picture or video when we did that 15 person man-chair?
Potent stench of a true man was too much to bear

im good at any of those times too although I would prefer the earler times
also seeing a movie at 11:30 is ass
full day
how long you expect to hang out with him
i would assume miles would say it himself if he was interested
I don't care
why would i
if you have a favored time you and whoever else wants to come can sort it out as im good for anytime till tuseday
ive been in town since Wednesday
because im 19 and I still watch cartoons
how did you know
well hell
just asking if yall were interested in seeing a movie today or tomorrow
I would tell him to fix his fuckin teeth
im back in santa monica
I was picking up more slav

and miles is one to talk about using appropriate tone in conversation
i just normally brandish my sharpened pitchfork when engaged in friendly banter
it never was
most people agree that its just ds1 with a hd patch
and looking at that spicy review score
it is 40
im checking rn
making it cost 60 bucks and getting it to be a better port is what they did in remastered
because blighttown is ass
except blighttown
and as far as ds1 vs ds3 goes, i like the maps and bosses better
its an old port that inst carrying a 40 dollar pricetag. spending 5 minutes to get the same experience as shelling out another 20 bucks is value
and try again
clean install it without that mod
agree to disagree
what do you mean burden
i went on nexus and downloaded 2 mods in five minutes miles i didn't carry the fucking one ring to mount doom
imo
and that free easy way does make the game better
you should do it
if there is a free, easy way to get a better experience out of a game
Michael if your car has a bad paint job is the car bad because you need to get it repainted?
where the pvp netcode was a fucking spaghetti nightmare?
backstab city?
are we going back to its original release?
if you enhance a product, then the product is better.
intended experience doesn't mean best experience
because todd howard is a dink?
i don't think youre in the majority
I think being on pc means you probably use mods with games
uninstall your entire mod folder for fallout newvegas
that doesn't make sense to me
that means mods
you said this is on pc
so that's a plus for remastered
BUT I will say that ds remastered actually has a large enough playerbase that running around with humanity will probably get you invaded in some places
im running an hd patch and a mod called Dsync. which makes the controls less retarded
and youre on pc. mods are accessible and easy to use.
if you hop on nexus and get some mods, its basically remastered without the pricetag
fight me
why are you still here then?
from Uniqlo or urban outfitters
vintage clothing?
you will know what im talking about
kill those fucking cup of stress skellingtons
just remember
darkest dungeon is pretty tough on the rng

regi
remy?
lets go back to regi calling eric an asshat
yall can rip on dota but if you don't play the game enough to actually be semi competent at it your criticisms are pretty pointless
that's a late game thing that has a minute fucking cooldown
that's pretty mechanical
can you disjoint spells with items or abilities in league?
wut
there is no skill in dota. and the game has a high skill barrier to entry?
later is more than 2 min and that can cripple a team
which is almost always more than 10 percent
you get 175 X 5 gold
you... get more than that
so its not like having to run to baron or dragon to buy an item
which lets you sit in lane and use cour to get secret shop items without losing pressure
you have a cour
heres the thing with secret shop
care
dont
i
but
antimage is magina
invoker is carl
hes right
fffffffffffffffffffff I want to team
drow ranger is named traxis, etc
and characters do have names

Alain barely remembers his birth parents. All that is left are faded memories about travelling in a vessel headed to an unknown destination, travelling in a caravan surrounded by goods marked for trade, and finally the end, when his parents were killed and their goods stolen. That would have been the end for Alain as well, had a passing patrol belonging to the Ashina clan had not stopped to investigate the ruins of the bandit attack. After being rescued from the road, Alain was raised to be of use to the house that saved him. Before he was even of age, he insisted that he be allowed to enter into the Vrucurian Empire’s  armed services. For the next 5 years, he would then train under a harsh disciplinarian instructor, Torii Mototada, a renowned trainer of recruits in the scout’s corps. Mototada would instill in Alain an unwavering drive to establish order in the Empire, even at the cost of civil liberties and obedience to the law. Such ideals were hardened in him when an elven lord, fed up with having to struggle under the major cities’ monopolization of fragments of eons, attempted to revolt. The renegade lord drew much support from disenfranchised peasants in the surrounding lands, and the order near Ashina lands was disrupted. Without waiting for orders to do so, Mototada led his recruits in a vicious punitive attack on the mob and the lord’s men. After the revolt was harshly put down, and all dissidents either imprisoned or put to the sword, Mototada went to congratulate him most zealous recruits, Alain among them. In that private meeting, he inducted them into the cult of Bane, stating that they understood that no punishment is too harsh for those who would disrupt order, even if they hide behind the shield of justice or righteousness. However, having overstepped his bounds, Mototada was reprimanded, being demoted out of his position, a punishment he has apparently endured multiple times only to be reversed after distinguishing himself. Mototada’s scouts were transferred back to their lords’ lands, with Alain returning to Ashina Castle at the age of 18. The next three years of his life would be spent in the service of Isshin Ashina’s heir, Genichiro Ashina, eventually moving with him to Gigantia when he was sent there to hone his ability to be a leader of men.<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1588467048542" ts="1588467048" t="61"></e_m>

fucking chess?
?
do we share any turn based games/
only games like that would be turn based
define
videogay?
basically if i write in my BS a reason why my character follows the ideals of a &quot;banned&quot; god in private, can i do it or are you saying outright no
so personal worship is banned?
am i only allowed to worship bolded gods?
i have a question about the gods list
k
you doing anything?
im pretty sure its ua
also doesnt fit with the token i want anymore
holy shit its bad
and since you said no UA i dont think ranger will be a good class since
well... im an immigrant
or is the new direction that we're all pseudo japanese
would that mean that miles would be the most native person there?
grass is green
uhh
if thats the case ill see you tomorrow
did you mean 15 hours?
15 omegalul
im on disc
k
how long?
videogay?
it takes 30 minutes?
guessing thats a no
can you videogay now?
i think itll be good
try it
idk
but the irl dnd thing we did was better than what we were doing at our computers
nope
have i tried it?
I don’t own one
It probably is
Also in the middle of smth
but I have a class in 30
or a marid
at their level shouldnt they fight an aboleth or smth
by themselves
just let them actually kill the thing that attacks them
you can still have them need rei's help
you can still break their boat
dude its honestly a no go
fucking what
curious?
chaotic evil
i am actually willing to bet i can kill your entire party in 3 rounds of combat with the kraken
fucking why
its just
or worse yet a swallow attack
because keep in mind it makes 3 attacks a turn, each attack having a dc 18 grapple leading to restrain
and they don't have a chance to burn down a thing with 500 hp before it can easily restrain the entire party
you wont kill your players because rei will save them when they need to be saved
i just think its a bad fight
they don't win
thats the point
they didn't win
thats what you want them to fight
3 of them
and legendary actions
and a restraining attack
with a reach of 30 ft
a monster with a plus 17 to hit
you want to throw a kraken at a lvl 11ish party
so just a question
them being adrift with their boat broken and then being found by rei doesn't reaffirm her as an ally?
it just has to feel like they won on their own
then rey can come upon them when they're clinging to driftwood with the carcass of the monster they slew floating nearby
it just has to be winnable
it can still be hard
it can still break their boat
if you want them to have a shot, give them some other seamonster that isn't cr20
if you want a tough set piece fight that the players stand no chance in do the kraken
you have my opinion
i don't know how much they actually do
I feel like things always seem to happen to and around them
didn't they need Ra
when was the last time they destroyed their opposition without the intervention of an npc
and your players wont like getting bailed out by an npc
im of the opinion that a kraken fight is stupid
which puts them on the same level then no?
its your setting
but then again
dnd krakens are almost gods
…. that are powerful enough to be a warlock's patron
krakens are also not beholden to fey as far as I know
why are you throwing a cr20 thing at them?
that's how she finds them
have the decimated remains of their vessels lead rey to them
let them have a fight with pirates,
even if its less of a set piece
I am an advocate of the players solving their own problems without npc interference
chad wields an entire mage as his weapon
anyways
say mage
as if chad wields a mage instead of a mace
also you spelled mace as mage
make them fey then
I personally like the second one
that's not suspicious at all
or a tome entry depicting them as construct rather than humanoid
like no records in the kingdom about who chad and thad are?
could give the party an opportunity to turn their shitty boat into a titty boat if they capture the enemy vessel instead of fireballing it
pirates looking to capitalize on the exile of peoples known to be in possession of shiny magic stuff
is there a sea encounter where that matters?
will a less shitty boat help them at all?
give them the full force of chads righteous condemnation
but if theyre dead silent while this shit is happening around them
give them some good boy points
shit like that
but if they idk donate money for a relief effort
well yeah give them the punishment
does chad talk like a chad?
shit like that
shit like that
like charis to see if you can keep the faith of those suffering from the food shortage up
or have them roll stuff to see how they respond to the shit?
will you give them an opportunity to talk when they get this stuff dropped on them?
will you give them an opportunity to talk when they get this stuff dropped on them?
and throws them a sending?
does she get news of their exile
how
no wait these are beginning session notes
rather than have a speedy runthrough of all this?
don't you think you should do some of these things in game
upon further inspection
upon further inspection
hmm
Not to just say: hey don’t do the bad now or you’re gonna get it
If they fuck up now, it’s on you to drop it on them
It’s like setting the pendulum 
But this is a lot of set up
I like it
Honestly
league?
did you do your presentation?
im down
no
lol
so
also i don't watch twitch to get a drop
i don't have a key gamer
other than league since I don't have any other multiplayer games
honestly is there any other option
so can you play or what
or are you working on dinosaurs
can you videogay
can you play rn?
made by competent and handsome people
skype is a brilliant program
did you just get that?
the fuck
asking for videogames at 12am  on a tuseday
im ready
ok
give me a sec
honestly im just doing work rn
k
are you good to play 1 or 2 games?
1ish im good too
later then
videogay?
videogay?
ill let you know around then
idk about myself
later then
videogay?
thanks
cant
all of them? even the big ones?
and then they die
they hit
the ads are just typical mobs right?
at that lvl most classes have ways to ignore light cc like that
k
this would be easier if we talked
can you talk?
that's what im worried about
whats the fear then?
the whole point is to make the fight feel good
and that feels bad
if youre heavy cced, you spend like 10 minutes doing nothing
in dnd, it takes like 5 minutes to get to your turn
in wow its something that you can quickly correct
it shouldn't be constant
with some bigger ones that need to be tanked a bit
if they go down in rapid enough succession
attacking the ads is what feels good
that's why the ballista firing just hits
even though you know it didn't do much, your players don't know
hitting an attack is a good feeling
rather than the opposite
that's why i think its better to make beefy people with low ac
and losing a turn feels worse
because missing feels bad
the one thing that i think dnd boss fights shouldn't have is heavy cc
mmmm i donno about that.
i think this has the makings of a good fight
otherwise dex save for half damage
will save you
interposing a person on a piece of something like the mast
so if the volley is coming from the right side of the ship
and it will be directional
have them volley fire bows or some shit
you could have adds on the sides do an attack
and have the snake reel back before it breathes
ok so have the poison cloud cover the part of the boat it will hit for a round before it rains
design it like a raid boss from wow or some crap
or at least a vehicle?
and is he proficient in siege weapons?
wouldn't firing the thing still be dex?
yes
f u c k i n g k i l l h i m
since when does that matter if one of your party members is weak
Discord
Ok

Who killed himself because he was butthurt at Odysseus
When Odysseus talked to the shades the only shade that actually refused to give him advice was Ajax 
Is there anyone whose dead the party had a positive relationship with?
Why would this character help the party?
Idk. Party won’t take it seriously js

if you have questions or want me to clarify any particular point or event in his life more let me know
Robert Ashina was not born to the Ashina family nor was he born in Nihon. His blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair skin betray his ancestry, outcast even among the human population of the war-torn island. When Robert was barely 11 years old, his parents sold all their holdings in Arentia, purchased as many simple weapons they could, and moved to Nihon with the intention of selling them at a premium price. Upon arriving to their first clan castle, Robert’s parents only sold the inhabitants a portion of their stock. Since they had a vested interest in keeping the war going, supporting only one of the clans wasn’t as profitable as selling to everyone. On their way to the next clan stronghold, Robert and his parents were seized by masked soldiers displaying no standard or livery. Robert’s parents were killed, and their entire supply of weapons were taken. Robert himself was left to the wilderness of Nihon where he surely would have died had it not been for a samurai of the Ashina family, a knightly warrior of Nihon, who had happened on the scene to investigate the commotion. Robert was taken in to the first stronghold he had seen, the one his parents had sold to, to live and serve under the teifling nobility in whatever way he could. Growing up to become a teenager of prodigious size and strength, Robert was trained to fight in the line for his new family, being taught to serve. In his mind, that meant to fight with honor and to do battle with his enemy’s soldiers, not civilians swept up in the fighting. However, before he was deployed to any front to fight and die, his masters took him aside and told him to serve in a new capacity. Robert was put under the command of a man barely older than he was. This man was Genichiro Ashina, another human who was also adopted into the family after his mother’s life had been taken. While under Genichiro, Robert’s ideals of honor before all were challenged by his new lord, who brushed them off as delusions. To Genichiro, the ends justified the means, saying that a true warrior understands the difference between honor and victory. While Robert still held reservations about the new path his life was taking in Genichiro’s service as a retainer, duty demanded that he complied to his new orders without hesitation. And so, Robert would serve, no matter what is asked of him, even if he is demanded to abandon his warrior’s pride. But it will never come to that. Can it?
or does she plan on doing it herself with the knife?
did she want the party to go to her nation to help with the coup?
just like how it was done with japanese christianity. until the government instituded a ban on the religion and started killing preachers and those who converted
its up to fina's own faithful to convince the populace
naturally. shed only promise to open the islands to the possibilities of becoming a place where worship of the diety could happen
whether she does these things is up to you
to appease the commoners to give them something powerful to shelter under should the fiendish nobles become overbearing in the future
she could sell finna as one such powerful nature spirit
they bent its core tenants to fit with their own world view, viewing jesus as a divine entity
well.. at least how the japanese took christianity
it would be like how christianity was brought to japan
instituting a celestial diety could be a means to try to bring in common folk to her banner
im assuming the fiend worship is more popular among the nobility
i could consider offering a place for finna in the islands
theres nothing in her chart to say that shes distasteful of religion
or what jetts character wants
idk what the psychic wants
bribe red penney with the treasury vaults of an empress
my plan rn is to promise lucina that ill bring my armies to azure when called
thats all i really want to get done with the npc
and try to convince each one to let me have the knife
honestly im just going to try to get time with as many of the pcs by themselves
k
can you play league rn?
i looked through it
my initial understanding is i need to try to convince the party to allow me to keep the knife for a time when we find it
if i have free reign and no guidelines i might say or do something you dont want her to do
when you can at around the time ill play her tell me what you want me to do with her if theres anything in particular you need to have happen
i can take it for next week
sure
the next time i can play anything like this is next friday
i cant do this week
in front where players can see or in back
do you want me to put bs anywhere?
when i get to use it ill bring it up that my stats were done with 4d6d1
thats the character for rn
or did you want me to take the rolls you put down
i did it
i selected roll and its saying the only options are clear and 4d6d1
point buy standard array roll
how do i do my scores
ok i did it
that i just altered myself
it was already a blank regular sheet
couldnt
i had access to a sheet and i put my stuff in it
i put my shit in the tbd character folder
im ready
k
simple life goals
D U M B
for the party to be in a country that's had a region essentially overrun by robots and not hear about that is kinda
having a temple taken over by drow is something that would just not be super widespread info
id still do the gnome in the closet
because while I hate being berated by garbage like that. I love forcing shit like that onto other people
technically im only giving you ammunition
im not a part of it
because machine men marching up a mountain laying siege to a holy vault with clockwork precision is awesome
you kinda have to make it so that the gnome is somewhat personable so that the party would try to recruit her rather than kill her
and every once in a while a piece of cover the party is behind explodes because in the distance a large crossbow with legs just mortars them
have lots of places the party can duck behind because thered be just a fuckton of man-sized golems going full auto with chaincrossbows
you could have this be an interesting combat by making it very coverbased
so you don't want to do the drow in the temple doing drow things while a gnome that's been eating dogfood for the last month has his automated ballista guns blast any drow that get too close to the bathroom he locked himself in?
back
was in shower
rn?
I was playing with miles

i feel terrible and smell worse
I just got back from the gym
aram tho
k
soooooooo
so idk if I have your smurf added
k
fine
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
one game before I go back to hell
can you play league
fuck that
actually
you can win
im just going to not open skype rn
i don't care
I have a midterm, a lab report, and a homework assignment due tomorrow
so listen
im gonna go back to studying
gratz reddit has taken your side
fantasy population statistics?
is this what youre bothering me about rn?
I also have a lot of work to do so I don't think I can do any videogames for like the next week
that's correct
so I went into the client and deleted any payment info I had
I got an email saying someone tried to change my password
yes
how old is yue?
fyi youre a good alignment right?
if you think youll miss it ill skip your intro and write on the stuff i know ill get to use
and i prefer rp over combat
its rp for session one
so was your sister
you were born in the swordcoast
or at least your father and mother did
because you had to have emigratted from shou lung
with that info im making some decisions about your family history that you as a character wouldnt know
asking the wrong person
then you better have a black character
i have 3 hours to write everything down. you can accuse me of oppressing you as a minority later
their names eric. im really talking about their names
i don't know any foreign exchange students coming here from china saying hello my name is howling cayote
im talking about the names here
so long ago none of their culture remains the same?
are asian
… the people of the Canadian ice sheets
ethnicities are white, black, and Asian
while he still has an ethnic name, it comes from source material and his backstory of having been adopted by as close this world has to Chinese people
and i told him no
youre still that, but now you don't have to force milo mars and jett to say nick lick every time
i gave milo a hard time about his name. i think it wouldn't be fair if yours isn't found in source material as well. listen, you can have your pc experience all that inuit stuff in her life but as far as the names go, i think you should go for more normal naming scheme
you are human, and there aren't native American types in sword coast
so i don't understand what ethnicity in swordcoast youre getting at here
Nyquil
youre gonna have to pronounce most of those names for me when the time comes
name your sister, mother, and this sergeant
while your sister went to sell the stuff you guys got, you spent your time with a sergeant at arms in the town guard in exchange for some cuts of the meat you guys were bringing in
ok i have the general idea
why would town guard train you? did you pay them?
i don't follow.
I thought your sister trained you
youre dealing with arctic wolves and monsters
nor do any civilized race
so no humans really live out there
you lived in a cabin alone man. what tribe?
have you ever traveled to luskin? or was that your sister's job
and youre a native of the far north of the swordcoast<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1574470658390" ts="1574470658" t="61"></e_m>
and youre a native of the far north of the swordcoast<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1574470658390" ts="1574470658" t="61"></e_m>
there is. means youre close to luskin
what type of biome do you want your little hunting cabin to be in?
don't worry about that
ill tell you how you leave
I think I have enough
and what is your relationship with them. session starts with your last conversation with your caretaker
do you have both your parents?
do you want it to be your older sibling or one of your parents?
you grew up being taught by your father or older sibling how to make a living hunting game and selling the stuff you don't need to a nearby town
are you with that?
rn im feeling that you lived alone with your family in a hunting lodge in north swordcoast
wouldn't ranger be more apt to that?
youre playing with a bard, monk, and another fighter
do you want to describe your relationship with your family? formative years? what did you do as a child or a young adult that would make you a fighter?
which is another continent
that's something that's indicative of a place like chult
there aren't really any remote villages of native types
so the setting is like Europe with citystates
so chances are hes going to have spears<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1574470132153" ts="1574470132" t="61"></e_m>
so chances are hes going to have spears<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1574470132153" ts="1574470132" t="61"></e_m>
hes playing lance longspear again
in addition jett is playing a fighter
and idk about any inuit type village.
so sword coast is an established setting
and you are lvl 1
your class should indicate your upbringing
your parents accept and session will begin with your last convo with your parents/hometown friends
but your parents or caretaker who has a connection to my npc named Viktor Ahnburg, a former adventurer of renown, receive a letter from him offering to take you under his wing to give you the crash course on how to be an adventurer
you are probably from a small town you've never left
you don't have a grand destiny
and youre not a worldly person
you are of a good alignment
or your race's equivalent
you are 19-22 years old
so heres the deal
ok so this may take longer
and you type
just listen to me talk
it really wont work like that.
waiting for jet
8:40
you good for it?
sword coast
faerun
5e
do you want a character or just to watch
ok
do that
i was also going to start then for jett
i still want you to sit in and see
if you are not playing this week im going to try to get them into mine
I still want to try my game. are you playing yours this week
thats all that matters to me
if we're still cool that's what matters most to me
I don't intend to play again as of right now. what bothered me the most was hearing you say you didn't want to continue the game because of the problems one person has
Sorry again
Well. I’m pretty sure you’re justified in feeling that way
If not
I wanted to show them what I’d like in a game and if you’re good for it you can sit in and see what I’ve got
And if you feel better come Friday why don’t you check something out with the guys
But if you want I would love to talk about it
I don’t expect you to respond 
So anyways I just wanted to tell you that I’m a foul cunt sometimes
But if you need a break you deserve one
I know I’m difficult and pissy at times
Mars can tell you
Even after you left I still said some fucked up shit
And I wanted to say I’m sorry if I actually made you feel bad like that
So I read what you put in to the chat after you left
Hey
maybe the combined autism of us 5 players dont mix
maybe this group isnt good at dnd
just dont.
if not
then continue
and if you are interested in continuing
just leave it alone for a few weeks
then the problem is solved
zoomer boomer might not make the cut
if you want a more serious game
and after the autism dies down then tell them what flies and whtat doesn't
just leave it alone for 2 weeks
you said you weren't going to think about it
or maybe not idk
talk to you later
k
no
if jett makes someone named zoomer boomer you could just say
have you ever thought about telling them no?
am i bothering you
tell me how to make this work for you so it can actually work in this game
you always just say yes to whatever i make and then complain about what to do with it after
you said we're nobodies so i don't think people would remember the private that supported his co doing religious no-nos
do you want me to change what i have?
i never got that
that never really came through when I was playing
somewhat disillusioned by the end
eager to prove usefulness to his country
joined army for similar reason as well
is that easy to work with?
made to leave army for same reason
supported old characters decision to raise corpses to help in fight
went to same battle that old character did
character was private in old character's retinue
I chose my old character
my character is supposed to be tied to one of the old party
hows race relations in your city?
yes or no do backstories matter
you really haven't answered my first question
or will you actively scorn me all the time in this game
do you not want me to make anything for this character
so I cant rightly tell
because if you dish it out baby you gotta be ready to take it too
you sure I wont ruin your fun?
sounds like youre still huffy
as if you ever did
do you want backstory or is it something thats just there to look pretty
that's a weirdchamp
you get a weridchamp on your account sir
but for now
I want you to run that by everyone in the party and see how many people agree with you
youre tripping if you think they're equal man
doesn't jett get to do it always?
getting advantage on one attack 
mainly thinking about miles
not all created equal huh
so I heard what other people's runes do
I have a council to influence 
Thanks for the letter
Sleep with eyes open and you won’t be knifed in your sleep
I leave you with this parting word
I have my letter
I demand cooperation 
But I don’t demand friendship 
It doesn’t net you many friends
Cynicism saves lives
Tell me again how this doesn’t match Elliot again?
A person who is unpopular with the commoners
That may oust the duke
A coup in daggercourt 
Oh my
And again you trust words over events
When did his wife enter the city?
But never him
People around Elliot die
You are too trusting of outward appearances
do try to think about that
and now a hresvelg lord marshal
elven allies in the city
riegan weapons
pieces are falling into place that makes a hresvelg coup seem more and more apparent
what makes you think that, when hresvelg rebels, the elves wont side with them?
didn't you just say that the hresvelgs are tied to the elves?
I get the damn letter don't I?
that last line seems like a good closer anyways
can we cut it there i have to go to campus for section.
so again... how many soldiers from house hresvelg?
but maybe through supplying the force that will stage the coup
but not a debt of gold through selling the swords and armor
and so perhaps the weapons are a means of paying this debt
it heard coup
the bird only repeats what it heard
and remain willfully blind
but of course count only the 1000 of riegan
and how many from hresvelg's allies?
and how many from house hresvelg?
1000 riegan soldiers.
how interesting is it that a pawn of house hresvelg intends to procure weapons for a coup
i tell the ironflex attendant that the bird cannot fake information. it repeats what it heard. 
and particularly that the weapons are to be used to stage a coup in Daggercourt
and have it mimic everything it told me about the riegan trip
i summon farsight (i named the raven)
does house ironflex know what those weapons will be used for?
so they seek to get the raw materials to produce weapons
is house ironflex aware of what the riegans intend to do with those men?
is house ironflex aware that joseph riegan has left the city to a nearby town with 700 men in tow?
now... that information?
of course
lovely... ive attained what i wanted from this meeting.
should i obtain a request to deal, may i return here and present it to house ironflex for approval or rejection?
but i promised a bit of information to schedule this meeting.
as apparently speaking with even you required... pressing
to do this id like to be seen as a consultant of house ironflex, which is a status i intend to leverage in order to obtain meetings with councilmembers who currently oppose giron.
i am one person but ill attempt to influence this vote to the best of my ability
i am satisfied.
19
can i insight to see if everything he told me is his firm belief?
and so again... why you over him.
but chad can be influenced to follow the same course of action cant he?
it would be certain if you succeed
then why, if you do care, don't you call for these dwarves to replace the elves even if chad is chosen as lord marshal
do you agree with my assessment that it suffers
do you care about this city's wellbeing?
why do they care about who hangs and who doesnt
they are not from here
why would these dwarves from black mountain be any better for Daggercourt than the elves
is deafening
your silence
do you even care?
outsiders stalk the streets at night, feigning service to the city as they hang its populace in droves
i want to get the measure of you. why would it benefit this city, in its poisoned state, to have you instead of chad on its council.
it just means you fight. it doesn't reflect on how you lead
being a gladiator is of little import
so hes a guard captain
Giron ironflex then?
i have a class at 5 lets do the chat so i can get this over with
it could be the day after
it could be the day of
and even if we leave right away to do the ambush, i don't know when mars and jett want to actually do their stunt
i don't think so
immediately?
what made you think we were splitting into two teams?
and why do i have to be camped on the road days prior for an ambush?
it really wasnt
i want to spend that time doing what i want for fucking once
if he travels quickly itll be days before he returns
ok then 150 miles away
isn't he in the fucking city
200
or however long the dragon said
hes 600 miles away
and not having to do what mars, milo, and jett drag me into
time that i can spend doing things that i want to do
that will take time
but for him to return to the city, even while hurrying?
probably not long hell just get a sending
how long would it take for that information to become public?
joe will return to the city hastily
and when news gets out that he is dead
the idea is that mars kills the boy
im not helping with the break in
or out
do you want this talk in game
fine
if i sense that he is no different then i leave
or would he be no different than chad
would he benefit the city when in a position of power
i want to see what kind of person this dwarf is
i do not come to this man with the intention of solely benefiting that house
while i currently am in the employ of a noble
and i can say that without artifice
no i do not
no
how many practiced nobles do not have ulterior motives that involve the propagation of their house solely<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1573689569666" ts="1573689569" t="61"></e_m>
how many practiced nobles do not have ulterior motives that involve the propagation of their house solely<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1573689569666" ts="1573689569" t="61"></e_m>
how many practiced nobles have a history of military service to this city
how many practiced nobles can shoot lightning bolts
if he dislikes what i have to say he can send me away
and i also inform him that that vaunted position his house currently possesses may not be so firm
i willingly submit myself to any magical test to confirm im not a spy
what exactly does he have to lose hearing me out
hes already on the backfoot when it comes to this vote. if he wants to stay there then he can refuse all comers.
do I get to talk to the dwarf?
you try finding it under the literal hundreds of posts mars and milo put out every 5 minutes
whatever his fucking name is
in the meanwhile I want to see if I can get a chance to speak with the dwarf as a consultant in his bid for captain of the guard
post it again
its buried under a mountain of shit
and their prospective vote in this coming election
what are the names of every councilmember
and when I accomplish this task by myself I alone will reap benefits from it
im doing what I said myself
alright I don't care about these two
thought he was 5th
how long would it take miles' blacksmith to make the 4 sets of gear i requested
if our people report something off then he takes a look and if there's any veracity to it he comes to me
patrolling lands surrounding the estate looking for anything out of the ordinary
can we put this knight guy to work immediately?
give that stuff to milo
its Lucia's business now. she handles him.
its also good for our image accepting a knight from the city's state sponsored religion
those are the people worth having, not the ones who flaked when they could. its a catch 22 ik but its still true
and yet some of them remain in the city as per their lord's command
but id rather have someone on staff whose loyal to the city and its people rather than some dude who fucked off to his treeline
i cant get use out of him since hes probably like: eww icky necromancer die in holy fire ewwww
still going with the pally
and there are 2 people who work under him that look just like those two guys from the cart
or is it like hmmmm all those prisoners live right next to this one dudes place
it still got out who we are and where we live?
and my understanding is that mars and i were masked while interacting with the elf
i tell the elves that their oath is to the city and that i no longer carry any military rank since my discharge. i accept the paladin into our service and pass him over to lucia
pally's price?
but the elves know who I am
im leaning paladin but im assuming since hes asking for me specifically hes aware of what I am. I ask if he is capable of serving under me
what exactly are either group's request? do they intend to serve for gold or is the paladin pledging his service to lucia pro bono while the elves request payment under my service
or should I put this to the party
I pick
sure
what would 50g get me
cost?
cough cough mars
i do want my own wizards tower eventually but id like to not have to be like a rabid animal to get it
i want to not have to do outright immoral things in order to get money to use and the theater might be a way to start with that
I do get a showtime tho don't I?
shit we really do just need money for anything and everything don't we
i cant attempt to turn these people into a militia of sorts
i think if an officer drills them enough they might not immediately fold under pressure and hey i guess that's good enough
so for my free time can I get a showtime during the game as well as spend some time with the people under our estate. other people keep wanting to make them into some sort of a fighting force but theyre kinda just farmers
A soldier’s duty is to his country,
Even if it’s to quash those who wish to be free,
To force upon kinsman outsider’s tyranny,
And suffer in one’s homeland greatest infamy.

And so I marched with my men in tow,
Those who looked to me for what path to go.
When battle was joined my forefathers arose,
And the ancient dead fell upon my homeland’s foes.

What a fool was I to have the gall, 
To refuse to see another fall, 
To have to bury anymore friends, 
To go to their families seeking amends.

By my command the order was given.
The dead of our nation would be arisen.
And so to save the lives of those who still breathed,
I sacrificed my soul and let my honor be diseased.

Now stripped of rank and cast out of clan,
How can I bear to call myself a man.
Woe betide my ruined honor and shattered pride,
There isn’t a day I don’t think I chose the wrong side.

how edgy
which for this pc will start as a raven
you might want to give me a tag for a familiar as well since I do have find familiar
Swain w
Got it
might as well make you use it
so yes im a fucking theater asshole
and my charis is actually even with jett
anyways I have prof in performance from variant human
sure...
for school this isn't exactly what i go looking up
i read this poem about a ball turret gunner whose corpse was so pulped that he had to be washed out of the ball turret with a hose
all of whom wrote the most depressing shit ever
ww1 and 2 birthed many famous poets
ummm
international actually
poetry is like their national passtime
hes an ex soldier
can I do a performance at the theater on my week?
its probably just fine
i dont even know what it does
rn dude the tactician one sounds fine
im studying for a bio midterm multitasking
y
his charis is is second highest stat
but still commands authority
someone who leads from the back, which doesn't sound admirable
and ones achievements. while he was discharged he did attain a high rank as an officer at a very young age
how about a great sense of pride in oneself
are you asking for a particular character trait? 
seeing as how he was torn between his homeland and his new nation and chose the one he had sworn service to
loyalty to his charge probably.
self serious and morose
they're humans from the steppes who valued their independence with weird customs about death and how dying isn't the end of someones usefulness
up to you
alright sir
lol
eh
so
but its not my game
you might want to call a reset sooner rather than later tbh
something you should have addressed
a
i really have no ide
youre grabbing randos next time right?
dont really care if theyre fine or not rn. ive been nolifing pchem for the last week
i have no patience for them anymore
if mars and milo bitch about something im not caving to them this time
i mean it
i said id keep this one until the games end
but yeah thats the character
itd be like his way of honoring his now dead culture
its not that he completely abandoned his culture
lone worshipper
what decision
ill control the pets just give them to me. skeleton and zombie to start
yeah sure ill do that
its my favorite school of magic
because I actually tried with this one
anyway like I said this guys backstory is more... existent than the clerics
im pretty sure milos church doesn't look kindly on making the dead walk again
hmm. maybe he did do that which is why he was censured for using necromancy.
sure
then that I guess
forcing things to follow rigid commands
if nobody is order then actually I should be order. necro seems like an order thing
and miles
milo
just put me in chaos
we have two people who belong to order
tell me if you need to change shit just do it and let me know
And because I want to be able to get it in for some of that sweet sweet religion what faction would a culture that vaunted necromancy be a part of? Order or chaos?
your silence is deafening
can you dig it
there
Wishing to restore his honor to either his people or his country, Adrian commits himself to the services of noble in Daggercourt. A noble who is unscrupulous enough to allow an abhorrant necromancer under his employ.
Adrian Lacroix (yes like the soda I like it bite me) was born to a human village deep in the steppes. Adrian’s forefathers were practitioners of the dark powers of necromancy, which they used to fiercely defend their independence from would be conquerors for generations until finally succumbing to the armies of the old Duke when Adrian was 9 years old. When the mages of Daggercourt descended on Adrian’s home, the necromantic teachings of the “savage peoples” was outlawed. Growing up exposed to the customs of both his ancestral heritage as well as the newcomer powers of Daggercourt, Adrian was eager to prove the worth of his people to his new countrymen by volunteering to enter the Duke’s army when he was 16. Blessed with a natural affinity toward learning magic, Adrian rose in the ranks as a mage commander at a very young age. When he was 27 years old, he had nearly 100 men under his command. 18 years had passed since Adrian’s village had been annexed into the duchy of Daggercourt, and many of Adrian’s kinsmen did not share Adrian’s desire to assimilate. A revolt broke out and those who were not natives of the steppes were butchered. Responding to the uprising, the Duke sent forth his soldiers to put down or exterminate the rebellious populace. Adrian was among those sent to reconquer his birthplace. Retaking the steppes was proving costly, as many of Daggercourt’s soldiers were being felled by tides of undead brought back by the clerics and wizards of the steppe. Many of Adrian’s close companions were killed by his rebellious kinsmen. Finally resolving to not see another of his friends buried, Adrian broke the ban on his people’s necromantic powers and ordered all mages under his command to begin raising the dead to combat the dead. With new, tireless soldiers bearing down on the people of the steppe, the rebellion was utterly crushed. The people of the steppe were scattered to the wind, cursing the traitor Adrian with every breath. After the rebellion had been quashed, Adrian was dishonorably discharged from the Duke’s army for the practice of forbidden magic. Now a civilian of Daggercourt, Adrian was without purpose as both his kinsmen and his new country had banished him. 
negro
let me finish
i mean it
i never said that about the others
i promise
ill keep this one
the metallic?
i talked to miles about this
by kowtowing to saints my character abhors
I didn't keep it
miles had that
or the game before that
it should be easy since literally none of my characters ever owned a magic item this campaign
despite milos personality being the same every game
i don't care. i don't have patience. and i drank 2 liters of coke in 4 minutes
im leaving the game
if they complain that im making too many new characters
and I just don't care about their whining
because rn my brain is fucking numb
ill probably leave this game
if you dont
then let me switch
so let me edit it for this game of yours. if you like it
i gave it to him and he said hed like something a little less grand
im going to give you the backstory for the wizard I had written when milos game started
heres what im going to do
im honestly losing interest
and I am having a hard time caring
mars and milo are up in arms about what I did
do your real life shit
np
then you saw this shit right
if needed I could cast divination to get a direct response to get a better understanding of what penance it demands of me
i suppose i could also send a letter to the apothecary shop and have him meet with me at the estate to discuss further business relations, informing him that i have the capability to expand his supply of natural components
how would one do that
so I don't think those murders were done in true obedience to the Miracle. so I want to spend time in penance for sins done onto others as I as a person of considerable power abused my strength over weaker men, the very thing the Miracle vehemently opposes.
can you tell me exactly how the grove recharge scales?
id assume its part of the whole process
if that matters
id plant growth them just the same as i had with the first btw
id want to know
what did these people go through exactly
dirty 20s on both
can i guidance
who the fuck knows
maybe the Miracle takes people who suffer to change their burden and punishes those who are evil with brutal death
ill go with persuasion and religion with advantage
do I have to do one over the other or can I attempt to do both depending on what I encounter?
what about preying on people who are actively cruel and evil, capturing them, and enforcing the Miracle's demands on them
that's if I encounter someone in a piteous state in which final penance is more preferable than life
if I want to spend my week growing my stone circle, how would I do that with rolls?
I don't feel as if one stone is enough
ok. if I choose reincarnate do I have to take the as is version of rolling new race or can I take a homebrew same race as is
do the creatures die when they are taken
so basically I need to make a grove, then spend a month
it isn't as much about building my own temple as it is denying my opponent another bastion
sons of the miracle don't seek each other out because their penance is theirs to bear alone so I basically if I do this, I do this by myself
rn im trying to see how I can use this week to spread my influence in this place because clearly im outnumbered
if I were to start making similar effigies to the Miracle in these basement levels, would I be able to basically turn his little church to my benefit?
how long until that's done btw
even the underground bits?
well I have a week to begin corrupting it from its foundation
not the big un
the one on our property
does it have floors below it. like deep deep below it
milos church gives benefits to clerics of his faith right?
So that’s my week right?
i have magic n shit
even tho I have 7 insight
I don't need fucking intuition
are the fucking statues magic
I have detect magic
so whats the lowest level I can break into without dealing with mythal shit<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1572332785911" ts="1572332785" t="61"></e_m>

reasonable to think they're kept underground no?
my understanding is that we're looking for a bunch of prisoners
and even with this magic defense he would have tried to get in so in the warrens theres a whole mess of warped stone and dried blood all over<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1572332251995" ts="1572332251" t="61"></e_m>

do I have a way in that way or no
ok well I only need a way inside the church not necessarily their reliquary.
because if its a thing like Hallow or some shit like that I could if I roll high enough dispel it
is this a thing that exists or homebrew
if this is a magical effect I should see it with detect magic right?
I could barkskin myself then give it a go
if all it does is inflict pain ill keep going
or does it prevent me from applying my magic
so im assuming this divine protection is toxic to me or smth?
like if theres warrens under the city that lead around the church basement that I can get into with stoneshape
i think i said i wanted to see if theres a way into the cathedral from underground
so i am all flesh. would that mean i have any allegiences to any members of that pantheon other than the miracle?<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1571903282280" ts="1571903282" t="61"></e_m>

would i know what pantheon it belongs to if any?
do you want to tell me anything id know already by now or youd like me to start with my current understanding of the miracle: a force of change that brings about suffering and corruption to those who draw its attention
k
unless youd like me to
you come up with it
yeah, what it is, what it wants, and why he was chosen to bear the burden as a son of the miracle
are you good with that or do you need something a bit more tangible?
his understanding about the divine miracle is that it often brings about corruption and change, demanding penance from those who bear sin in their hearts
so my character does not know the will of the divine miracle, and he would very much like to so he may more appropriately serve it
oh should i give you a sort of goal for this character or is it a sort of just do your own thing dawg youll be fine
if the party needs like a diplomat or smth to go talk to someone
do you want to just drop noxalas from the world or do you want to make him a hireling?
also I don't want to juggle two characters
same theme tho
also I like nature cleric more than druid
the petty isn't mine dehhhhh
ill ask them on the day of
they didnt like me having two pcs last time
idk how the other guys will think of this
im ok with like one of these two basically being nothing but a hireling
and pick one of these two
unless you want me to actually commit
so if we're going out of daggercourt iago
which effectively means he hates it too.
also i fucking hated going out of the city with noxalas
if its like... normal people shit... noxalas will do it.
if they need someone whose ok with doing some violent shit iago will do it
kinda like depending on the job and what the party needs
sure
idk if you want to put whatever that is but id think its just worth goodboy points with the Miracle
maybe a seed from a petrified man
anything that would be connected to the miracle
id probably have broken into the estate and spent my time plant growth spamming their greenhouse until someone found me
do you want me to do any downtime stuff or is it that I just start in the manor just as theyre about to do this mission?
do I benefit from that religion stuff you posted a while back?
lovely.
did they exist? sure everyone knows they existed.
so I guess that's a fuckin no
There is only the miracle
right?<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1571698657388" ts="1571698657" t="61"></e_m>
right?<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1571698657388" ts="1571698657" t="61"></e_m>
so i assume the church still doesnt like me
ok
circle of land forest or underdark?
will i get flak for wearing metal?
i could just make him a druid
or is this more of a druid thing
do i have the ok?
that's a thing
I mean you could just say no
hed just look like a humanoid with really dark skin
he hides his visage in a brass mask depicting the &quot;First Son of the Miracle&quot;
or do you just want me to worship the red queen or whoever the fuck
we cool?
So befitting a worshipper of a force of chaos, iago wanders into Daggercourt and prophesizes the coming of the Miracle through ballads and the like
ok is that good enough?
There, amid a thicket of trees made entirely of the writhing forms of men and women who were petrified to wood by the powers of the Miracle, the boy was taught to use his gifts as befit a Penatent of the Divine Miracle. 
as fate would have it, penant pilgrims who worshipped the Divine Miracle found the boy, recognized his disfigurements as signs of the Miracle's favor, and brought him to a shrine in a wood in Daggercourt.
Lolth's priests dared not kill the child for fear of drawing the attention of the Miracle, who would certainly spread its affliction all across Lolth's domain and so the child was left on the surface to either die or survive
showing that his soul was claimed by the miracle
His entire face is marred by crisscrossing streaks of wood
It often warps stone to bear jagged points and turns flesh to bark. Iago Ath'Faer was born bearing the telltale &quot;blessings&quot; of the Miracle
It manifests itself in the mortal plane at random warping the forms of creatures and objects it encounters.
The Divine Miracle is a formless and shapeless force of mutation and change. 
ok so here's the deity
want me to run it by you so you can ok it
that is heavy on mutation and changing things shapes and forms
i was gonna make up a force of chaos
do you want me to pick one of these deities or use them for inspiration for mine
i have an older version of strongholds and followers
court of the all flesh is in that?
that's a no
seeing as how i don't know what that is
i don't see any info on that court
sure
we have someone in the order court I can be in the chaos pantheon
can I make up a deity since hes divine soul sorc?
I can make one if youd like
honestly im not sure if it would matter since we kinda just do whatever jett tells us to do
because im the only one who uses the fucking theatre the new pc also goes there. that's how nox knows him. I don't know how much of a backstory you got from everyone else do you need me to give you one?
for 4 and 5d6d2 for 2 right?
its 4d6d1
would you like me not to?
I was about to yeah
anything noxalas knows will be given to the new guy as he is now in their group
and give them a way to talk to me if they need to
before the session starts ill say that I left early in the morning to go get my replacement and have him present himself to jetts character
give me the new guy
but help them in finding a replacement
it really wouldn't be ooc to distance myself from these guys
If you want me to stick it for rn and see if it goes more one way I will
I want to defer to you since it’s your game
So there wouldn’t be a “entire party one thing while noxalas is sitting this one out”<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1571601070362" ts="1571601070" t="61"></e_m>

What do you think? I could have noxalas refer the party to a “person of magical talents whose morals align better with the party’s” and he can be used in a more npc stance as a hireling or smth <e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1571601017055" ts="1571601017" t="61"></e_m>

i don't feel that i fit
most of the people here are evil, and most of those evil ones are particularly cruel
tbh I don't know if this character should even be in this party
yes
fr eric what do you think about what i said in the groupchat
i mean youre omnipotent and omniscient so if you wanted to see the damn things youd just look on my sheet
or should i not give you these before i do them in the games
Blackened soul bound in lead, Given by father to Lady Dread.
To please the mistress of the night, she had the poor boy fight and fight.
For cruelty cloaked in false virtues, no law of man could bend her views.
For past slights that bore no ill will, father faced his son’s intent to kill.
Six times father counted him slain, only to see son carried aloft back to the dark lady’s fane.
Despair left father’s soul without hope, with no son by his side to help him cope.
“My son is lost to me and has long since died. Oh, noble heir! Where would you have me bury my pride?”
“That terrible spirit that bid me give you to Lady Dread, and turned you into a monster bound in lead?”

unless the play thing lasted both weeks
i don't remember
did I give you my week 2 yet?
and if he can be convinced otherwise
and that's something i want to find out
i don't know why yet
and here I am trying to find a way to chat up a 25 year old kid whose dad wants to murder me and my boss
honestly I feel like im the only sane one trying to work with a bunch of crazy people
ok
specifically the aberrant mind sorc?
also if we do end up doing that reset you talked about and I change my pc can I pick one of the UA subclasses?
the fighter is cool
fighter rogue ranger
new ua
i mean im not a 200 year old traveler and even i am questioning that history
I can still be skeptical tho cant i
in other words would noxalas, with his plus 7 in history, know that gemi chance embodies none of the virtues that his church stands for?
and are they remembered how they actually happened?
are the events that happened in your first campaign canon in this game?
is there a point where I don't have to pay for showtimes or is it like I just get bigger crowds?
what exactly does having a higher position get me again?
pretty good
so
someone did actually die in it
real gamer hours
theater is more important to me than the academy
im assuming that's my freetime
that puts me at 540ish gold including having the second showtime
so that's net 430?
im assuming another 100
how much does it cost to get that time?
19
sure i can do that
since i only accepted 40g that month to give penny enough to keep up her thieves guild membership
id have to do a show to get money
apparently they all need entry fees. none of which i can afford as i only have 100g
or should i take back my 100g
do i have one?
i also already put down the money for a showtime
how does one do that
its important enough to me to try
id still give it a go
if I can get into his class and ingratiate myself with him then I can chat him up and maybe make a tie
is his level of magic on par with mine or does it exceed it?
k
not ok parsa persuasion
so like me actually talking to you right?
if i do get a chance to actually talk to him, there would be a conversation
doesn't that just happen?
its downtime mang
if he likes me, that's great. if he doesn't then that's the end of it.
it really hardly matters. if he attends the academy in a class i am able to get into, id try to attend it and see if i cant have words with him
flight isn't exactly a novice thing
he seems interesting
does he attend the academy
that riegen boy is a wizard right?
unless im aware of someone interesting attending a particular class in the academy, that isn't very interesting
just because I am the most level headed person in this group doesn't make me a fucking bookkeeper
the others can shoulder these responsibilities no?
so that's what id do. id even try to cultivate relationships with noble members of rival houses if that's a possibility
and that's kind of all this character wants to do. learn interesting things that the movers and shakers of this place are doing as material for poems
as a means of learning new and interesting things
idk what I would do during this downtime except preform. I could try to ingratiate myself with house staff of important nobles
and we kinda fuckoff and do our own thing for a bit?
so in your game weve got bouts of downtime while in town right?
and gives you access to an ability at lvl 2 that circumvents challenges that higher level parties struggle with
ofc youd like it
its op you dingus
but the others are dumb
maybe not eloquence bard because that's a FACTS AND LOGIC argue until you get what you want class
the recent string of UA classes are really op
fucking what
and they get it at lvl 2
firey teleportation is stupid<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1571123545400" ts="1571123545" t="61"></e_m>
firey teleportation is stupid<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1571123545400" ts="1571123545" t="61"></e_m>
its horseshit op
wildfire druid
now you don't have to cobble some retard homebrew shit
fire druids are a thing now
did you see the UA for druid?
and i don't know these fucking people im writing about
cant use guild in the name. makes me complicit
Shadows have eyes, from flash of steel and wild grin, the blood and gold flow
its like... the law or something
im a fucking bard
wont actually use them until i get back to the fucking town and get a timeslot
Donno
Blessed by holy writ, She who stood and faced the storm, Daughter of Divine.

i like miles' the best
i might change it
I don't like mars'
haikus are 5,7,5 right?
k
special investigator daniel
face hidden and body cloaked
he was in the same disguise that he was in when he went to the poor people area
yes
I thought mars needed to leave early
when were we starting?
so can you get me or should i just uber
youre still out to dinner
what do you want?
cool
whens your thing Saturday?
I wanna talk to people and meet npcs in a dining hall
im a bard man
you told me not to
should they be connected to any houses or what have you
yes
but I don't have to hate them
and they can hate me
if people find it patronizing then that's them
even them
even with people who antagonize his employer
hed try his best to be strictly neutral with everyone he meets
as for what he wants, he wants to witness ore even play a hand in shaping the future of the city as its in turmoil at the moment
so he might know some people who frequent it
He spends time at the noble's theater to mingle ore preform every so often
definitely a theatre
excellent
so to have somewhere in the city he can stay and document whats happening in the city
hed probably offer his services pro bono to be kept nearby
maybe hes just there to document the events in the city as its on a precipice
so hes college of lore
k
can you talk rn
idea
no
have
i
do you want to talk backstory?
wanted to see if you wanted to so anything rn since im not at work rn
oh right school started for you
you home?
I think you should make this counterattack thing not take the same resource as that stuff
shield takes a reaction
because then spells like shield and absorb elements are hot garbage
does it consume a reaction
explain the counterattack rule
gestalt learning or black empire
what r20 did you want to use again?
so I have an idea for that
but im just going to assume the church doesn't like me
you said yes to tiefling right?
im thinking about a character bio for the tiefling monk
I don't in particular
im assuming milo is the son being referenced in that last bit right?
i can help you there
i mean... do you like kabob?
not pasta
no
umm
k ill get ready for that
alright. when?
you want to pick me up or should i drive somewhere?
k
we can hang out after
if its a thing with your girlfriend I think you ought to go with her alone.
both are going to a concert
whenever. milo and jett are out
k
do you want to ask the lads?
im not working today and tomorrow and would like to do something before I get sent back to the rice fields
ok
do you want to hang out after or do you have shit you need to do since youre back home
or later
are you home rn
i think session zero will be a good way to show you what my game is going to be like
i prefer theatre of the mind for that exact reason. if i can describe a setting on the spot i don't need to agonize over finding or making an image to convey what i want to to my players
school more important
lol im not paying
upgrade?
I think ill try but if I see I cant keep up then ill pass it off to someone else if someone wants to pick it up
im still sitting at my comp doing nothing
it never happened
And there’s a McDonald’s right there so we just go there and talk for like 2 hours before going home
DND ended at 11
I’m not even lying
McDonald’s 
Still am not
I wasn’t home
hold up my computer is killing itself
or just spend a few moments executing him and saving that headache
i think lu bu should have been stabbed yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaars ago
so he would murder you later?
told you
just get good man
that many peasants in one place causes a mass singularity of stupidity
what can I say man
fucking pleb
afraid of peasants?
I think youre just retarded
and don't know how to code
CA is bad at their jobs
because yes. mods make the game stupid unstable
uuuuuuuuuuuunless its modded I should have added
ive never really had crashing problems with total war
o o f
i have to wake up at 6 tomorrow
im going to bed soon
I think you just ask your mechanic
as for your question he said that you don't need to replace all 4 unless your other tires are worn down to warrant it
if its the tire wall then its not salvageable. but if its just leaking from the part that is touching the street you can get that fixed without needing to replace the tire
so he wants to know from where the leak is coming from
ok so hes with my mom so I got in contact with him
ill ask him when I next see him
but i reckon it depends on individual tire pressure/wear
i don't know where he is and he left his phone at home
umm I just woke up after coming home from work
It looks good
His names?
K
To go to the place?
Do you think you can pick me up 
no
k
k
ive been on
still?
what happened to league btw
so umm
I just got out of the shower
tbh he will probably use them
yeah I was gonna ask if those were milos names
ty
no I havent
no
umm
oh
but still no<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1560989037581" ts="1560989037" t="61"></e_m>
but still no<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1560989037581" ts="1560989037" t="61"></e_m>
… of what btw?
no
That ones cleaner
rn
and also that isn't a question I can answer
im back in sm on thursday
yes
im going to sleep
it late
pfffffffffffffft
the religious nut who saw &quot;darkness&quot; everywhere?
are we game today?
then i can
if you can dig it
so its probably just me and kev
keta barely is a person tbh
im ok with doing 3
talk to the other guys
hullo?
yeah ill play 1
i was playing dota
k gl on the tests
you still there?
I think I fixed it
im not sure if I can
my computer is having trouble
Check your door btw I don’t know if I closed it good
Right through where we went before you went to the bathroom 
We found it
Mars said he’s going out with him tomorrow 
Jett’s back tomorrow man
Hey dude I’m back in SM do you want to hang out?
when like a week ago i got 70
idk why but i cant play anything rn im gettling like 20 fps on league
it cant really run any games
my computer is really fuckin bad rn
and that's how you get easy bishop
if there is a sf on the opposite side invest in one assassin
heres a tip. just build warriors warlocks and you will do fine
I can say you probably played like 10 times as many games as I have
ttyl
but fr this midterm will murder me if I don't spend some time
good luck idiot
so
but honestly if you can get her to even answer the door that is a feat I would have thought impossible
that's weird
go home
also shes probably at work I don't see her car in the driveway
that's wierd
also thats wierd
no
yeh
ONE
maybe later
im working on a paper
bad
feels
weve done a lot of combat
we could do some exploration or rp
umm
im back in sm btw
yeah
were we starting soon or?
tell me when you hit the road
my dad needs it
i dont have a car
do you want to meet up there?
fair enough
noodles for breakfast?
where do you want to go?
i havent eaten anything today
idk breakfast then?
umm
do you want to do something?
mom has it her trackpad is broken
dad wants to walk to beach and back
also I have to go in 20 min
because that sounds terrible
and I wont play on a trackpad
I don't have a mouse
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh booooooooooooooooooooooooooy
wanna play videogames for like.. the next hour
im not muted I think
videogay?
online or afk?
i was playing insurgency with david
dont you have a party?
but then ill have to do it all over again on saturday
and ill probably miss tomorrow becasue im working
i missed today because i was asleep until 3
100 split into 5 20s
not at one time
all but the run
im gonna walk to the beach and back with my dad first
no
I didn't sleep last night and im in no condition on play league
I think youre only making a distinction between the two because it serves you this one time. and I don't care
because ive seen it before
like that fish thing
league gay
I’m doing something with my dad idk what they’re doing
I’m playing smash at milos house
Nope
a Mexican place next to milos house
then grab lunch with milo once jett comes back
im about to take a shower
in an hour
I played a lot of league already
q?
umm
mmmmk
uhhh ok
don't you have like.... a larger than 1 champion pool?
what happened again?
at about 7
I went to sleep
give me a sec
i just got back home
no
but not before
friday
no
no
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ni
nope
Where are you
I’m outside
Idk
3029 shrine
Your place
I’m 3 min out
I’ve got shit I’d like to drop off
There
Where is here?
Address?
alright im coming now
ill be fine
so they wont have to come pick me up late at night
itll just be easier for my parents
if you dont want to deal with it say no
your call
do you think I can stay over the night?
are all your roommates in the dorm?
What for?
put me down for skeptical
if you see that your players ignore it, then scrap it
if its a positive influence on the game, keep it
implement it for a time and see how youre players interact with it
this spreadsheet you've shown me isn't very telling of the system youre attempting to implement. as in all things, playtesting with prove to be the best trial one can have
who handles that sort of thing
id feel like you would get better participation from your players if you have one named npc with a little bit of character
rather than hire nameless npc &quot;spearmen&quot;
based on the efficiency of missions and nonsense like that maybe it would be fun
if you want to have a system where pcs have troops at their disposal for story reasons, that could work
I don't think you should have to make your players put an investment into npc hirelings
im 90 percent certain
that's going to be this
THEN NEVER AGAIN
we basically messed around with it for one session
do you remember when we had an estate in the first campaign?
I have had games where players were allowed to have hirelings, but more often then not they forget about them and just accomplish their goals on their own
and it will be in black and white
I can make one
honestly my least favorite
there
then you whined
pretty sure the first picture wasnt
how bout a plague mask
define gay
i honestly thought the first picture was fine
are you looking for a guy in armor with a hammer or something?
i didnt
do you want me to just fill the thing with skull iconography?
what exactly are you looking for
do you want me to rp the blood hunter leaving
Tell the group you want to try that for the next session
Having a serious gameplay change dropped on your players with an established and inflexible comp can be tough
But classes and subclasses to adapt to the change
Not reroll stats mind you
And give them a chance to reroll
Ask your players
Even with hit die we really get shredded in combat
One we have a crippling deficit in
Health is a resource
But with current party comp, I don’t think we can make it
I think if a majority of players are interested go for it
And give them an opportunity to reroll
Talk to your players
Were you planning on instituting it?
Were you planning on instituting it?
It just breaks the balance of the game
Certain subclasses that get their resources on a short test would be strong
Warlock would go from bad to ok
Also exhaustion would cripple a character FOR AWEEK
Before everyone picks their classes
And I think if you planned on instituting it, you should let your players know beforehand
That would cripple some classes
i was playing videogames
no
that's a normal character right there
as a tiefling with 16 charis at lvl 2
with that you can go warlock
but the cleric isn't being a main caster
we have rogue cleric
that was his first time
and again
no im pretty sure milo said he was fucking around the first time
if we are just fucking throwing shit at the wall ill probably swap from forge to tempest cleric just so I can do more damage
i think milo wants to try to run a more serious game this time
I don't think so
miles is getting a pregen character from milo
im not memeing at all
I don't think Michael is hard memeing
so are you hard memeing in milos dnd thing?
anything
i cant bring myself to reread
youre reading malazan then?
are you reading anything rn?
I don't think ill continue with malazan
idk
but that wont happen because rake is the author's self insert character into the series
until he gets stabbed repeatedly because that's what immortality means in this universe
and thyr is &quot;light&quot;... fucking only thing tattersail did was use wards
4 elder warrens don't have an attributed element
but ive seen no mage use mockra yet
maaaaaaaaaaaybe mockra
chaos was probably the most interesting one I saw
most warren powers seem generic at best
also what the fuck was vorcans warren?
whats the difference between an ascendant and a high mage then?
but then again immortality doesn't really mean the same fucking thing in this universe
and the knight is the mortal sword of said god.
not king
rake is only knight of house darkness
i didn't think they were gods. im pretty sure the only gods are the kings of warrens
and yet hes the fucking mortal sword to one of the oldest gods
and first of all, his fucking goal is to remove the influence of any god from the battle to take place in derujistan
the jaghut was free before lorn did that
most ascendants are idiots anyways
which at this point is aok
but he isn't completely defeated until further into the series
for the planet to exist he had to be chained
that was only after he was chained
which is lame because of all the gods his story wasn't braindead
i didn't read that far so im pretty sure he gets whooped somehow
I don't think the crippled god is in the rest of malazan
but that's only related to book of the fallen
tf eric? how do I know about the crippled god before you do
at this point in the story im all for the crippled god breaking free and blowing up the fucking planet
the son of a deity from a species who are removed from normal understanding of life
whats more this entity feels too above reality. which I reckon is what the fucking author was trying to get
but rake wasn't there
ik that was the empire plan
im not sure if ill continue reading book of the fallen
but that's not the point
even without the acorn
I don't think they could have killed raest if they tried
ik what a soletaken is
one was a dragon
rallick and vorcan
an entity that couldn't be killed by 5 dragons got banished by a fucking bugman's bomb
how high fantasy is too high fantasy?
by what? the fucking house?
the way the book reads it says that they were chosen
why is this significant
so yes they went into the azath
apparently its a popular theory that kellanved and dancer are shadowthrone and the rope respectively
kellanved and dancer were also supposed to have entered a azath
vorcan and rallick
fucking why?
and they allow chosen mortals to enter because?
It’s a building?
I have no idea what an Azath is
I finished gardens of the moon
it usually backfires
yes. ive done things because i hated something
that makes sense
its a visceral motive
humph
not anymore
wel..
its not
ok fine yes or no?
do you want me to kill evil things softly and with kindness? dude what?
the order gave him an opportunity to do just that, which is why he is indoctrinated
I think he violently despises the empire, and wants to put it to the sword to prevent anyone else from experiencing his hardships
that work for you
in my thoughts the backstory would be that, now that the vard have been made by the empire, my bloodhunter was sent to be a representative from the order to the vard
and if im going mutant, its going to be a lot of self betterment through mutation
and maybe he was orphaned by the empire, found by the order, and now is absolutely indoctrinated by their teachings
i think the order was started to exterminate the empire
if motive is all that matters then its just everyone in this order is devoted to exterminating evil
how edgy do you think the lizard man is?
idk man
do I get a yes or no?
because you complain about everything I pull
for me
and that's why I got frusturated and told you to just make a pc
btw
and most are
nor are witchers… you know... the thing they are heavily based on
then warlocks cant be protagonists either
idk what you saw them as
I saw them as monster hunters
no it wasnt
no
...
but don't play any edgy pcs because I need all of you to be the braindead protagonists
hey everyone its a grimdark universe
booooooooring
yes or no
I think that's the one
… I mean I just sent you a paragraph on blood hunter
does that include some of the more well known ones?
you said no homebrew classes right?
Giving its buffs and debuffs permanently 
And eventually you just have one mutagen active all the time
Up to 3 I think
You prep mutagens that give you buffs and debuffs on short or long rests
The order of the mutant is pretty interesting
I think its actually officially endorsed by wizards of the coast now
have you seen the blood hunter homebrew?
I doubt it will ever come up
an n+1 rule to con mod related to spell levels
I do think the con mod idea is probably the best idea
lol
With which I can stock up enough temp hp to cast a spell at an unseemly high level, like my previous combo of contingency create undead
With only losing 2 max hp, I can theoretically gain unlimited temp hp
If not first, I can just cast it at first level to begin the chain 
Lol
At which point you can cast false life again
If casted at 3rd level, you will lose no hp and retain a minimum of 2 temp hp
Higher lvls give an additional 5 per level
Lvl 1 spell gives 4+1d4 temp hp
False life
And it breaks my magic system
I have an idea
What happens first? The health deduction or the spell
i don't think i want to man
i want to. im probably going war cleric for 2 levels after lvl 3 fighter
and honestly im considering multiclassing into a wisdom spellcaster since I have some pretty good wisdom
and do you want me to deduct 1 hp from my maximum when I casted shocking grasp in the first session to test my magical ability hypothesis?
fair. is there a time skip between 1st and 2nd session?
I myself have no means of gaining temp hp
also im pretty sure overcasting your max hp makes you explode
it does make flavor sense
before it starts taking hp<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1540434913597" ts="1540434913" t="61"></e_m>
before it starts taking hp<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1540434913597" ts="1540434913" t="61"></e_m>
you can have me only be able to cast a limited number of cantrips equivalent to my con mod
due to your earlier explanation about how contingency works
I thought hp loss was solely for spells that requires spell slots
not being able to use cantrips cripples experimentation imo
retroact using the metal?
I take your silence as a &quot;please don't pursue this bullshit parsa&quot;
also do cantrips drain max hp? because 2^0 is 1
this is just me thinking ahead
idk
it may just be easier to cast reincarnate
but if that's the way we're going to treat contingency then id say that there isn't a point to casting it, and it would be more efficient to just naked cast create undead
and that was the first plan i came up with
or more specifically researching ways to extend his life
by researching them
id argue that hed know those spells the same way i found out about those spells
Choose a spell of or lower that you can cast isn't limited to fifth and lower
like a wight or a mummy
i would be able to cast it at a level to turn myself into an intelligent undead
and if I theoretically can cast any spell at any level
and the effect would be that, on my death, I cast create undead on myself
I want to cast contingency
should I tell you my stupid plan?
unless this isn't so<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1540432271468" ts="1540432271" t="61"></e_m>
unless this isn't so<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1540432271468" ts="1540432271" t="61"></e_m>
the nature of the power you gave me means I know every spell
but theoretically I have the potential to be able to cast any spell in the game right?
you said my silly spellcasting requires that I have at least 10 max hp under the amount I will lose in order to cast the spell?
so do I change the avatar on my character sheet to this token?
I did and I downloaded it
n
im at the website but idk what you mean by make it a toke
god I hope you didn't give us a bunch of higher lvl npcs that will just show us up all the damn time
is this a recent development in my life?
how long have we been in the vard?
or the party
are these npcs?
whats this stuff under squad (yours)
did I give you enough?
do I have to get blinders, a saddle, etc separately?<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1539669666683" ts="1539669666" t="61"></e_m>

I have 10.
ill just get one my way
no is an answer
You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
human variant my guy
the feat I have says otherwise
is it too much to ask if I can start with a draft horse
fuck yeah
do I get the ok?
4d6 drop lowest for all 6?
are we rolling stats?
what level are we starting at
alright
or perhaps more than just the one
also I think one of the guys mars picked up is on the younger side...
maybe don't cuck it up by giving us the macguffin 5 sessions in
good luck with this new batch
well now im going to be all about god damn horses
we never use horses and im about to make a cavalier
I changed my mind
ill save my lunatic ironman for another campaign
I think ill go with the dragonborn
what about what?
what?
well
i don't know
i didnt
well then. id say my misreading is forgivable
oh right you unfriended me
i don't see you in any game
when you don't respond it usually means you don't want it
its a holy artifact to him. not to mention no one has even the faintest clue what magic/mechanical requirements one needs to use the gun. 
he wont let anyone fucking go near them
its his obession
which is when he snapped and went ballistic, leading the experimenting members of the empire to deem the test a wash and have the subject sacrificed
the way i was leaning was that my character was used in magical experimentation in the empire, which involved fusing his flesh with a suit of metal and preconditioning his mind to have an understanding/obsession with the necessary knowledge to produce his inventions/tunder cannon
i did have an idea for how i would make the gunsmith almost make sense in the setting but mars told me you didn't want us to use guns
and ill turn it into a martial class or something
and give it to me
make a fucking character
if you don't want me to play something that you cant bear
it was that or a dwarf with a huge fucking grudge toward the empire because dwarfs and grudges go hand in hand
no mistrust of other races save for the one THAT LITERALLY NEVER EXISTED UNTIL RECENTLY
that's what im playing.
ok listen the character wants to see the empire gone. is willing to take part in the vard to see them gone. but is very tense around elves and doesn't trust their word at face value.
it doesn't register. they would be wary of it
someone whos been abused his whole life wont understand kindness when they see it
to sell it later? idk man
umm yeah?
you wouldn't wonder what the hell it wants?
eric after fucking generations of slavery and suddenly this new fucking creature comes out of the woodwork
is wariness betrayal?
and i would pretty much be permanently wary of a new fucking species that came from nowhere
i mean i usually base them on shit i would think
as for any sort of character personality i haven't decided anything yet
but i cant find a good picture
i would have made him blue and go all in on the lightning theme
i was going to make a white dragonborn eldritch knight
also all races are on the table again?
&quot;You were taught their ways, a new way to serve; discipline and respect, rather than fear.&quot;<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1539552170918" ts="1539552170" t="61"></e_m>

in your doc you said &quot;we were taught to serve&quot;
then we are equal?
are we not the vard?
i want you to tell me the vard's relationship with the elves
I don't know what in particular you think I should know
or at least partially
he did
so did you decide we're doing an offweek?
first session is breakout session<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1539376681169" ts="1539376681" t="61"></e_m>

ohhhhhhhhhhh that would be cool
have we not?
do I know what an elf is?
I have questions about the setting
that will do
go tell him the situation yourself
i need to actually do some work
dude I was supposed to start working at 7
in my mind, mars has been guilty of making characters that actively seek to destroy themselves
you can explicitly instruct your characters that it is a core pillar of their character to want to see this empire crumble
but all the same if you don't want to dm that's the end of it
he would go back because what he already stole isn't enough to complete his transcendence
what other personality can one have if he has a single driving desire that is at its core impersonal
if he has no other goal in life
add any personality
that doesn't leave much room to do much of anything
because i don't want to play an altruist eric
it may be that he learned the magic and technical skill he needed by stealing it from those he toiled under
and the way i was leaning is that he wants to destroy this black empire so he may plunder its secrets to better himself<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1539311702571" ts="1539311702" t="61"></e_m>

i suppose the desire for such things is what made him escape
basically hes that except that the whole becoming more machine is a way more religious experience for him
the cyborg that wanted to improve his bionics?
do you remember that character you played in space jam?
you want us to all know each other again?
would magic not exist until elves came?
i wanted to make a human
one can have reasons for such a thing cant he?
and would seek to better himself through the inventions he makes or comes across on his adventure
the gist of the character would be that he wants to transcend his humanity through &quot;the purity of metal&quot;
if i get an opportunity that is
anyways i like the class and i am leaning gunsmith
then i suppose that the gun is just a really big arcane focus
blast wave isn't described as being a shell
ones a shot and the other is a cone
id leave that up to the player to flavor
id call that some variation on firing
thunder monger and blast wave
what would you call the special attacks then?
gunsmith is more the way to go
i feel like if you want to feel like more of a mechanical engineer
i really am liking this class
on an unrelated note
you say that youre not in the minority with your beliefs. you will find that if you voice that last claim, you will be outnumbered by the people thinking youre raving
the third line contributes nothing to that point
i do not argue that such things don't exist
indeed there isnt
i see ive done it as well i guess
attacking an argument by devaluing the individual arguing it is a tactic of people with low cunning
and desire to be so isn't good enough
i need a reason to be angry
i am
i do not believe this to be so
i doubt i will ever convince you
would you like to continue this later?
i do have things i have to attend to
we have been at this for an hour. 
this idea has nothing to do with the possibility to not have any feeling
I do believe that this ultimately began with you berating my PC creation preferences
it is the memory
it isn't the desire to feel that emotion that brings it about
simply by wanting to be angry, one doesn't become angry
no
umm
your statements only evoke confusion
I don't believe that idea to be true myself
all the time?
do you believe then, that at all points in ones life, they are feeling all emotions at once?
it is an often sought after thing, to be utterly detached from feeling.
if you lack an emotion, so it remains as such until something gives you reason to feel an emotion
you no longer lack desire
if you desire to have a desire, you have a desire
is the lack of desire a desire in of itself?
are you claiming that the lack of emotion is itself an emotion?<e_m a="parsa.jourx" ts_ms="1539309656308" ts="1539309656" t="61"></e_m>

is the lack of hunger a hunger?
your own statement disproves itself
the lack thereof
if it doesn't exist
why do we know what apathy is
emotion in particular
apathy is described as the lack of emotion
mere semantics
what is the difference between these statements
by virtue of the fact that such an idea isn't so utterly alien to us that we cannot define it, understand it, etc
that the lack of feeling exists
you have yet to address my own claim
do you presume to know what everyone is thinking when one says such things?
which is common enough
you say indifferent
then we use these words incorrectly
or neutral
or indifferent
why do we know what it is to be apathetic
if the concept is so foreign, why do we understand its definition
i can
right?
by your constant accusations of my own moral standing eric i think you think yourself as being good
or &quot;it doesn't matter&quot;
shall i call you a liar then, every time you say &quot;i don't care&quot;
indeed you are too
we are always not feeling emotion about things
it is the LACK OF EMOTION
and id like you to read the definition of apathy
i decide not to do so not out of lack of empathy for those who will die
which shatters your entire definition of morality, love, etc
so it exists
and you are now?
which, mind you, need not be restricted to only existing to a certain time
meaning that the first you killed has faded into indifference
for a different bug
no?
do you think on every bug you have ever crushed?
that is retarded
you believe that, having felt an emotion that is never again evoked is the different than indifference?
impossible
which is as you said earlier
you just described indifference
then that becomes not caring at all yes?
then it is impossible for something to not be troubled over
if you believe it is impossible not to care
that statement as well shouldn't be possible
to kill a bug
then that is an evil act
is an impossibility in your own belief
i don't care
because i don't do so for particular things?
do you believe that i am incapable of showing empathy?
and you may just have an overinflated sense of self
all such things i find revolting to look at
spiders, insects, crabs, lobster, shrimp
it shouldn't be allowed to exist
if it wears its skeleton on the outside
no
is stupid
lying to oneself, believing in ones own fabrication
one cannot feel kinship to something you see as literal vermin
he did not. his platform was to dehumanize
if, down to the very way our minds work, to not care at all is impossible
how are such concepts not utterly alien to us that we cannot come up with them?
why, if such things don't exist, do we understand what they mean?
i do think indifference exists
i do think neutrality exists
you have such a fundamentally different view on things that I simply cannot reason with it
then to not care about someone or something is also impossible
eric if indifference doesn't exist
one can recognize that the face is indeed human but they attach no other significant feeling to it
or even the opposite?
does one make judgements that would lead to outright hostility if he sees a face that gives no inclination to it?
apathy is indifference
apathy is not hate
wrong
and the absence of such a bond is?
I think my answer is concise
what is love
do you agree that love is the presence of affection?
then let me argue this point
define love
how do you define evil eric
self preservation is the same as malicious intent to you?
indeed it may be out of self preservation that you moved to take the gun away
one has no chance to think, to determine what the best course of action is 
circumstances like the one you are describing occur in instants
wouldn't that go through a human?
you are an unreliable source at best when it comes to such things
this extreme sense of altruism is unlike the rest of your character eric
then no there is no obligation
at the risk of losing ones own life
that statement is wrong
if it is indeed 20ft in
what means would someone have of knowing that such a beam exists without being in the building
what danger is present by not going into the burning building
and is it a simple matter or removing the beam? 
am i inside the building in this case?
that implies that indeed you could have helped them on a whim
COULD HAVE is a strong implication
instinct isn't something you can quantify and has no place in an argument about what one is and isn't capable of
that's stupid
how can one be of sound mind to determine that?
the risk of death is good enough
going into a burning building, risking permanent life injuries as well as death, is not an obligation
one does not have any moral obligation to return into danger to help others ESPECIALLY if they are not in danger themselves
putting them in harms way implies that it is your fault the building is on fire
as you put it
when i described neutrality in my burning building example, the person did not put others in harms way
are there not degrees of selfishness?
your argument, as i understand it, is that to be selfish is evil
cowardice does not make one evil either
is being selfserving being a dick? and is being a dick an extension of being evil?
did you equate calling 911 to diving into a burning building?
if one is in danger the law prescribes that you can help if, by doing so, you don't put yourself in danger as well
you are wrong by the way
but at the detriment to oneself?
they are fundamentally separate from one another
the law does not determine ethics
this is now an ethical quandry
i disagree
the evil guy was probably the ass that started the fire and is actively trying to keep people in the fire
the neutral guy helps himself get out
if youre in a burning building, the good guy helps others get out
and I fundamentally disagree
I don't think there was ever a point that I made a malicious character who actively wanted to kill people
cheqir was just a mean person. 
valyra, tyrion, and drakki are all neutral
the paladin was just a bad character
name 3
you oked the backstory. of a serial killer. and thought she would be a heroine. Im the abnormal one?
something you should actually tell your players during CC rather than muse to yourself and hope that they will do just that
what is it youre looking for? us to play characters who will feel worse when we are forced to do bad guy things?
by making him do charis saves
who you tried repeatedly to force down doing evil things
wouldn't let me play solaire but a fucking serial killer that was repeatedly abused by his uncle and aunt? A-OK
if you want us to do a good campaign, don't say yes to a backstory that involves being a literal serial killer
3 people
which is what mars and i were kind of upset about
if you want to scrap the campaign say it
youre the dm
we were going to do more normal people shit before we got to the crazy worldending catastrophe
i remember you said you were going to make buildup slower this campaign
i do want to keep the dragonborn character i didn't get to play her that much
define... evil?
i think you should have let your players be more able to steer the campaign where they want to go
again we got that sword too early
and then the fucking macguffin said eat shit ill do what i want
i didn't want ahn to get the green goo blessing and neither did literally everyone in the party
nobody wanted to attune the sword but someone HAD to in order to leave
i strongly believe that a problem with gming comes when you push your players along the path and essentially force them to do things none of them wanted to do
but I guess that's why people liked it. they liked to roll more
milos action economy is fucking crazy
or we might idk
i don't think we're getting a meme jam
though I think he wants to gm
apparently milo has renewed interest in dnd
are we going to have an off week?
so what exactly do you propose for Saturday?
we didn't earn that shit
which in my mind was, in both campaigns given to us too fucking early
the macguffin
have we talked to atlas about the sleeping thing?
how long do you think that one would go?
if we have to restart, wont you have to fundamentally rewrite your story
do you want to hold on to him?
did you talk to mars and grim
videogames?
I don't plan on getting one
Ive been on campus since 10
I was never home today
Basically says sorry is possessed by House of shadows 
Malazan 
It confirms what I already know but it’s still interesting to read the characters ruminate on their meanings
I like the tarot card readings
will lesser restoration work? I don't know if it lifts curses
I have a question
you can take care of that. make it malevolent if you want to put her in a darker path
i don't have a patron named for myself
i wasn't there
i don't think we had any direct interaction with him
leon might wanna &quot;do the right thing&quot;
it looks good and seeing as how we are fucking off south, probably to fulfill mars' murder fantasies
i don't think you can get them for 440
the mount I want isn't even on the auction house anymore so... estimate 500k
not a druid don't have instant mounting
I picked up herbalism
alright then. how would i in this mock game identify white eyes' motive for projecting this new plan?
a third and new addendum. Pass on this fucking awful task to someone else. i don't know fucking kidnap some child, sear a mark on his face and tell her/him to stab himself with a green sword for the glory of lolth
i don't have to be the only option
And what about a pawn with ambitions to become a queen?
After I free him, he will toss be aside like a fucking used handkerchief 
Then I am shackled? Powerless and unable to rebel? He doesn’t even have to keep his end of our bargain
He claims to be patient. I don’t believe him. 
If I become unique, then I become essential 
That means he needs someone like me
He wants Elder Blood right?
I burned farms, made effigies of their inhabitants corpses, and now I’m contemplating genocide
This character was fucking true neutral
If not, then I’m all in for extermination
Are there any other ways to make myself absolutely indispensable to izlodi?
i should probably also ask if pursuing izlodi's favor is even possible/beneficial
I don't see you
Alright it works out then
guessing that's a hard no
then again, Valyra doesn't know that shit and is still skeptical that its nothing more than a magic sword... &quot;You swing it and they die. That's usually how it works.&quot;
why the fuck them damn knife ears keep selling us this &quot;it will corrupt you&quot; story
the green one doesn't fuck you as hard
and you say he has been on more adventures since our fiasco with Lilith, despite the fact that his lifespan is.... a fourth of Lyreth's?
ill read gemi's shit later
didn't read it
chances are im not getting called in so I don't have work
It’s getting repaired
I don’t have my computer rn
at which point I reminded him that the weapon probably isn't wieldable as much as it would try to wield you.
he literally randomly sent me a message asking if izoldi is a sword
and izoldi is actually trapped in the gem in the sword's crossguard or pommel
W/out*
W/ot
You there?
But yeah I think I can come
I just woke up
he isn't in the group chat<e_m ts="1530297016" ts_ms="1530297016579" a="parsa.jourx" t="61"/>
Are you working rn?

HOW HERETICAL
all my nibbas acting out where the wolves at
where the hood at?
skulls
no statement from michael
it seems that that is the case
that statement was super unclear about when
the roads are closed
they arent
tell milo that his time is up I guess
ummm
did you try to say no? or now?
when
campaign
but if I get into my lab, that will change
as of right now my Thursdays are clear after morning

tomorrow
THE HERETICS
ARE
WHERE
WHERE ARE THE HERETICS
oh and xenophobia
that's about it
I'm a dead'un that worships demons
I really don't have much more to talk about
one name leads to another
my character: I sense heresy... oh wait that's me.
not stacked matchup
cleric vs undead
eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
skulls for khorne
and you make me sad
I like murder and also youre overthinking the game
because... I'm sure he'll have much insight
with unka unk present
lets argue about it in character at the start of next campaign
its not very clear
I think
to run the fuck away
to get a boat
we're going to a fishing village just south of that fucked up city
and apparently we aren't even going southside
inhumans
and as such i will immediately call at precisely 1:30
i am nothing if not punctual
Edited previous message: that mans chat is unclean<e_m ts="1515273245" ts_ms="1515273246323" a="parsa.jourx" t="61"/>
and must be purified by cyclonic torpedoes and virus bombs
that man's chat is unclean
hes a fucking demon i bet
i just want to know what mars' reveal is
i donno
BIBBUH
i think we're abandoning you in a tavern or something
I believe so
 Have this picture
NUT DEMON
ALLAHHHHHHHHHHHH
no weaknesses lul
if that is when the heresy is vulnerable, then yesh
FINE
OK
ok
you do not know de wey
niet cyka
right now
like
I kinda need to know
is that a no or a yes to tomorrow
davai
and just let mars idle in the tavern
honestly its up to milo if he wants to delay
if you have late night work tomorrow as well, shouldn't we just delay it again?
the reason we didn't do it today is because you had late night work
i think so?
I'm going to school sunday
niet cyka
dew it
do it
just call the damn group
well if you want to see who can come
you didn't say it
&quot;I'm triple gay&quot;
only if you say the magic phrase
he said today is the best for him no?
cyka
niet
any day but friday
have we sufficiently harassed milo yet?
I think he should choose to not harass spellcasters that can kill him really hard with one spell
jett's new character is antagonizing the cleric
jett's old character antagonized the druid
mars your fucking keyboard is so fucking loud
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
were waiting on JETT AGIN

JOHNNY CAGE
whose claim to fame is getting punched in the nuts by the OBJECTIVELY best character in mk
goro is an mk character
we'll be trendy and say mars was exploiting children

hes not answering probably cuz hes workin
im ready to play rn
it wouldnt be workers comp but you know what i mean
also fr what fucking workers comp do you get for your rapidly changing schedule?
eric i would like to throw etan off a high surface
kevin is your skype workin now?
eggcellent. spread the plague
im already upset
Midterm next week and all
I can use the extra time
I thought not. It's not a story the Chemists would tell you. It's an Economics legend. The Commons was a peaceful land full of cows, so lush and so fecund that every farmer could graze their cows and create milk... The Commons had such rich resources that the farmers put out as many cows as they could. The Overcrowded Livestock is a pathway to many dairy products some consider to be... unnatural. They grazed so many cows... the only thing the farmers were afraid of was losing their cows, which eventually, of course, they did. Unfortunately, they exceeded the carrying capacity of the commons, then the cows died in their sleep. Ironic. They could save their bottom line from death... but not their cows.
MARS
 BLAME
yeah
OPA CYKA BLYAT
assuming same time this week right?
I am
The zealous martyr is praised for his valour: the craven and the unready are justly abhorred.
oh and heres a 40k quote
be ever vigilant
trust no-one
it is the ones that come masquerading as allies which are the most dangerous
enemies come in many forms
also mars poisoned a bunch of people. good job mars.
this is the completely unbiased recounting of what happened over the last two sessions
so they cant be good for us
also there are a bunch of bullshit runes somewhere in the city and we don't know what they do but the elf-witch wanted them there
and are getting ready to join the attack in whatever capacity the elf-witch deems us fit for
we then escaped the city
we poisoned the city wells, started a slave rebellion, and started a bit of political intrigue.
the elf-witch wanted us to sneak into the city we were attacking with magical disguises to spread around a bunch of magical tokens that did different things
I could try
fuckin heretic
I can dig it
sound pretty cool
are we game this week?

youre lvl 7 now btw
im done with my work

Skaven Master Race
I always saw vargach as a big orange saurus 
lol
dodge
just
i think we'll try it with who we have and if we feel like its not working we could find another person
I don't think we got around to that
No I cant
He’s bigger than me
He said yeah
I’m with Eric rn
and combat isnt the main thing with this dungeon i think there are only 2 fights in it
depending on how on the ball you guys are with the puzzles
should only be a bit over an hour long
its a simple and quick dungeon crawl of a dungeon i found on DM's Guild
kevin if youre interested im doing a oneshot with mars to try my hand at story telling
so ill probably be game for today
we don't usually do too much. just gifts and dinner then we forget about it
it is my moms birthday today so if we play today I might be late
I think it might have been a scheduling thing
that was unexpected
mhmmmm
and now mars as fancy bling on his hands that let him be even more heretical than he already is. 
so yall trampled around a giant temple to collect masks
I think I missed something
Umm
markus doesn't drink.
no ive got work to do fuck off eric
ash
be
to 
need
they
if anyone else gets in the way hold person. those books direct someone how to become a lich
if the bird gets in the way kill it
and burn them
find 2 books on her person
if alix dies before you resurrect her
also here's an important thing you have to do
he hates necromancy and not his ideas when it comes to afterlife
the god is Kelemvor
but I still don't think I should play because I probably have to study for my other final
and im done with it
so my final was actualy 4-7
ill add it in his sheet quickly before getting back to studying
to deny critical hits
its pretty easy but now that he's lvl 6 he wants to be 30 away from enemies
someone can play him
7-10 pm
yall have fun without me and don't die. or do.
so I wont be able to play this week
im in finals week and I have a final on saturday
well
riiiiiiiiiight
That's a grudgin'
ride the cat into battle
and yes. he would praise the fucking sun
the next best thing was playing a golden dragonborn paladin of pelor named Helios Aurelian
fuck you you cant stop me from finding my very own sun
I wanted the solar knight class so I could engage in jolly cooperation eric
headset problem probably
we all hear eachother
is your mic not working kevin?
?
should I bring my computer/
this shit shouldn't be seen as an obligation
I mean im all for taking a break for a week if some of you guys aren't up for tonight
that sounds like some folks wont be 100% when we play tonight
mars can tell you ALLLLLLLL about it
we only played one
don't worry

the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes
having to fucking play hotpotato with politics depending on who youre talking to
or maybe that's just a my family thing
my favorite color is purple anyways
to myself in the mirror I couldnt care less
to my aunt and uncle, im a republican. to my immediate family im a democrat
no worries mars. ive been experiencing cognitive dissonance when trying to maneuver the political landscape this thanksgiving
youre a rainbow of different kinds of dementia aren't you?
that would be your Alzheimer's acting up again

very cool
thank you ubisoft
the ubishit special
ahhh yes
the story was retarded since the beginning
what
ummm
numbered games
anything beyond that is kinda… extra shit
tbh ac lore really only revolves along the first 3 games
alright
no wiki this is all from my own knowledge of stupid stuf
there might be spoilers
do you want me to explain everything I know?
THE TEMPLARS DID NOTHING WRONG
because spartans were the most subtle killers

I feel like if you wanted to get rid of the cart you could just make it stuck in the forest
we just kept eviscerating him until someone finally noticed the gem  inside his body
in a campaign I was a part of we fought a troll who kept regenerating limbs until we cut out a magic artifact that was attached to the base of his spine
start counting rations without telling them
why is this so low res
roman names or bad
a normal person would see this as a transition from a conversation about food to pictures of cute dogs
popular meme
clerics are a great idea
how unfortunate.
character trait weak-willed
you probably want a good party comp or something
itll be greaaaaaaaaaat
if you do an interview ill zone of truth and we can ask the hard questions
have a panel with all of the pcs just fucking grilling these npcs
demand in game interviews
mars
I once saw a celestial warlock who rped a docter and his familiar was like his nurse
chain got good rp tho
5th
lol
since mars wont be receiving it ever again
keta how do you feel about being a target for the bless spell
I just wont heal you
this is honestly fine
it would be like if vargach wants to do A and tnesi wants to do B, you settle the dispute
I feel like the captain would be like the decisionist. basically solves ties if the party is split on what they want to do
have any of you guys seen anything from pennyarcade's acquisitions incorporated?
but it would probably have a bit of rp attached to it
the captain only has to micromanage npcs
newest to the group
I wont make for a good captain either
its magic and it needs no explanation
beyond that youre kinda obsene. shit you can do transcends human capabilities. (shut up I know half of it is magic)
youre a bonafide badass
by level 5 youre like Rambo and john wick
remember that at lvl 3 youre already a tough guy. youre like mel Gibson's character in lethal weapon
I don't think pc intelligence is even comparable to actual peoples intelligence

oh right. opening fire on a vampire, sending it into a crowded cafe
we have castlevania for that now

this is fine
except rape... and murder...
FUNNY VALENTINE DID NOTHING WRONG
still not as self centered as johnny joestar
oh right. jotoro is a deadbeat dad
OK
they were like: we want a character whose like vito Corleone except more homoerotic
it doesn't have to make sense
and that's supposed to make up for rampant theft
and his heroic trait is... that he doesn't like drug trade
then we have fucking giorno whose fucking goal is to become a &quot;gang-star&quot;
joseph worked. jotoro was pushing the envelop
it worked for Johnathan had actual heroic qualities
as the series went on, the fucking protagonist got less and less... protagonist-like
honestly I couldn't watch part 5
the guy whose clothes look like fucking cheese?
he looked like old Indiana jones
or better yet, don't dress like that. the most sensible clothing a character had in jojo was joseph in stardust crusaders
pillar men? please. dress like a real man. dress like joseph from battle tendency

never played the class before i wanted to try it out
blood hunter eats damage like no one else
and i do have to say
i wouldn't if someone said no
I wanted to ask everyone if they were ok with me rerolling
APOCALYPSE
CHEESEBURGER
MAN
ONE
me and burger
and i was leaning toward making him act like the tf2 medic
the keep them from dying subclass
leaning towards grave cleric
i was thinking grave or tempest cleric
its ok just apologize to mars for his being born an idiot and move on
its not nice to make fun of people's disabilities keta
i figured if i got the ok from everyone then itll be ok
having me suddenly swap pcs every so often isnt something i want to keep doing its just i feel like we could really use it for the game to be more enjoyable
would everyone be ok if i rerolled my class to help get a better composition going?
every session we seem to be strung the fuck out on healing
also i wanted to ask everyone this
optimal
i assume we're good to go for tomorrow?
excellent choice
honestly probably the most optimal place for such a thing in the entire U.S.
Alaska is an optimal place to be mauled to death by a polar bear
rip your skin off?
you can dress for the cold. what the fuck are you going to do in California?
id rather be freezing that overheating
Just do it now
Would that mean you actively take fucks away?
we don't need that shit
take mask of many faces or youre playing the game wrong. agonizing blast is a vanity invocation
at least invocations are cool
and that'll tide me over for the next 8 hours ingame
the warlock state of mind is: ill cast hex
well other spellcasters have the spell slots to actually... play the game
2 cantrips a turn 8 rolls
mars eldritch machinegunner?
stabbing people with swords tho.
you cant describe to viewers or players black lightning arching out of a rock in many ways
and that's something we can all appreciate
at least fjord isn't a blastlock
AHAHAHAHAH
BUT ELDRITCH BLAST OR WHATEVER
its thematic to how they don't actually know magic or some shit idk
but if that shit isn't in most campaigns then well fuck 
its good for dungeon crawling
ha heyyyyyyyyyyy warlocks make me want to die
and the rest of the class makes them dogshit
good videos. I like to think I would do better in the situations he describes... I LIKE TO THINK THAT
puffin forest
oh and they were level 1
I watched a video where a guy talked about dming a 4 session long mission where the players weren't allowed to long rest
that's some serious hardcore mode
long rest is an in game week I think

and im willing to let it stay like that
I don't think anyone else in this party knows about gemi
good on us
so 
which is actually a step up from the typical composition of murderous racists and nymphomaniacs
I repeat myself. the party was made up of lunatic sycophants
we fucking used the favor the monster gave us to basically use it as a fucking taxi to the next town to impress the guards
eric your pcs were literally a roving band of sycophants who wanted to prove to everyone that they were hot shit
battlemaster assassin rogue is a dumb combo
which we barely managed to do despite giving our ranger/rogue hybrid like.... 3 free crits within the first combat round
for reference eric made us fight a homebrewed creature who was immune to arcane casting. the monster was way more powerful than us but all we had to do to &quot;prove ourselves to it&quot; was to beat it within a third of its life.
fun and didn't make me want to club my fucking head open with a stick
because that was fun
save for something homebrewed like a creature immune to fucking arcane casting
but I don't think dnd has too many rules about the casting type of spells unless im missing something
if I was running it I wouldn't CALL them divine casters, but id probably give them the same game rules as divine casters
whoever is running the game
up to interpretation
which is more in line with the rest of the themes of the classes
there once was another type of casting called &quot;primal&quot;
I think druids and rangers being given the title of divine casters is a relatively recent thing for dnd
unless that's like a character specific thing
I don't reckon rangers worship gods
that's from nature shit man. divine magic in my mind is that which is given to the caster from gods
nature magic is heresy. divine magic is where its at
either that or I can confirm my suspicions that druids are even worse than I thought
idk some dipshit bard thought a fucking tiger was looking really good
it depends on if the race has a stable genome that isn't to removed from humanity
cat people are debatably heresy
elves are heresy
demons are heresy
which have a statline similar to woodelves
cat people are tabaxi
rakshasa are demons
that statement is so stupid it stays stupid
and im not willing to do that again
we literally played dnd for like... 8 hours that day
game went on for too damn long
lawful good aasimar gotta keep those wings somehow
sounds like someone we know
oh? is the pathos there?
did you pull the punch?
empathy is defined as: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
even if they are trying to put forth a false impression
and being empathetic means youre more capable of discerning people's real meanings or feelings based on faces or words
out of 80
i take everything someone says or types literally because im that dumb
you have to remember that I got a 9 on that empathy test I took last quarter mars
Richard and Mortimer? why yes mars I was well aware of your powerful iq.
I mean it would have to be a simple thing right? shifting all numbers by 1 in a particular direction to spell out a proper question
even with whats given
I don't actually know how to get to that answer
fucking brilliant mars
… the answer eric gave us?
YOU DIE FIRST
no
i refuse to die first in a combat
but at the rate im working at, id reckon it wont be too long before I get another chance
character creation
i was excited I almost got to participate in my favorite part of dnd
but we shouldn't pay attention to that
which probably speaks to some deeper character flaw I have
than again every character I play ends up being a sarcastic, greedy, racist asshole
I mean it was for me
i thought it was a character thing
Dealing with rogues
because fuck demons
anyways hes an honorary grey knight imo
or I think they call him doom slayer or doom marine I forgot
the guy who mocapped for doomguy voices goblin slayer in the dub
is this like one of your senpais?
I have no idea what that means
FUCKING WOO he says. im not excited he says.
pst
murica west side
why are you excited? I know youre just gonna be late by like an hour no matter what time we set
roll a dice lol
dark heresy? good thing.... I got a flashlight
of all the black library books the gotrek and felix series is the least grimdark. horus heresy is pretty grimdark tho
nope
gotrek and felix has some funny parts in it too
either horus heresy for scifi or gotrek and felix for fantasy
for books you could look at black library
and crunch is actual game rules
fluff is lore shit if you didn't know that
id lean to mordenkains because its got some fluff in there, which i like.
but again xanathars or mordenkains
but anyways keta its up to what you want. you should look up what each book gives you and whichever sounds the most interesting to you pick it up
when i was playing at aero hobbies
when i was home yes
i did
also I bought my book to support my local gamestore since im not a fucking drain on society mars
idk I like having physical copies
personally id go with either xanathars or mordenkains
theres also the monster manual which gives you a bunch of monster stats, which is good for dms
also I made a mistake the elf and teifling subraces come from mordenkain's tome of foes
with the phb+1 book rule
I assumed this was for adventurers league
and a bunch of new subclasses
xanathars gives you a bunch of elf and tiefling subraces
what do you want, because each book is different
im assuming we're set for tomorrow normal time yes?
calm thyself
he goes to public school and doesn't own a car eric
oy vey my tax bracket
Y I K E S
well now hes as old as I am
I agree
this is true
yes
sam riegel from critical role?
i have an intuition
she cannot yell without a tongue
that is unnecessary
zzzzZZZZZZZOOOOoooooommmmmm
and yeah I think we're go for 8
when we get started ill tell you guys a funny story that happened which is related to this
I have no idea what that means
ill be honest man
Since Eric never said that we’re changing times I’m assuming we’re good for the same time this week?
then... that's all the reason he needs to not go
you could just... go on your fucking date
all the same I can start early or end early
this is a thing that happens
people get better overnight
claim to be sick? idk about you but half the college in sb are practically coughing their guts out rn.
I found this on the internet
voice only
I don't want to have to shave
so I wouldn't bother with marking xp
that's how the last few went I think
its not about beating high cr shit
I think were doing xp differently
8pst
if mars calls the group, which will happen, don't answer it
commit this to memory everyone
mars youre so full of shit
idk what yall are working with i just did 2 paragraphs
i didn't go too in depth idk if eric needs more ill give him more when he needs it
I finished mine a while ago
im saying all this before eric just comes on and calls me an idiot for passing bullshit info
so id reckon session 1 proper
also there was a doc he put out on more themed lore shit which was linked in that reddit post
I think any intro for backstory and all that should be given to you in the handouts he has put on r20
yes
yes
yes
yes
what
attack spells will automatically be put in your attack tab
 if its in the I tab, you can drag it into your spell list
which would provide good contrast for other characters
it would make sense for you to go about life in a naïve way
a cyclonic torpedo is already on its way. enjoy exterminates heretic.
XENOS.
THE.
ABHOR.
abhor the xenos
human best race
heresy
lest you be disappointed that you cant play your lunatic machine worshipping metal man from mars
get the ok from the dm before you set your heart into anything
i could be wrong i have no idea
I may be mistaken sam but I remember saying you wanted to be the cleric
metamagic two eldritch blasts
he told me he was going to do that dumb sorc warlock multiclass that I told him about
and a cleric
to answer your question sam I think we have a fighter, a wizard
no worries it took us a little bit to get r20
and swords weigh 9. its not supposed to makes sense
do you look up items in the tab marked with an I and drag the items and spells you want into the character sheet?
in his words, he will let you play anything that isn't outlandish
or so he has told me
he is eating
I believe we are rolling stats
as of yet
there is no mess
no you did not
theyre supposed to be from another realm or something. came to this one. found angry gods enslaving everyone. and decided not to be down with it
dude everyones backstory is just: Was slave, now not slave, now jungle fighter
no just a character motivation
my character wants to never die
people die twice. once when they stop breathing and a second time when the last memory of their existence dies.
oh I actually have it
in the grim darkness of the far past everything is shit
which I am having difficulties with
ive been specially directed to not make an edgy backstory
maybe earlier and have us play on the day of
well id figure that the dm will walk us through CC saturday
i have a prestigious collection of plastic dudesmen
I like rolling many dice.
Im leaning towards being a fighter
is that in the UA?
I don't recognize that class
do yall know what you plan on playing when we get to it?
so easily you tell him to fuck off
how many folks did you find?
ill rip your head off
do you want to simply say we got the fuck out of there?
Edited previous message: shouldn't we give them some time before we start? in addition we haven't heard from all 4 of them<e_m ts="1530301300" ts_ms="1530301301407" a="parsa.jourx" t="61"/>
shouldn't we give them some time before we start? in addition we haven't heard from all 3 of them
it was for a time
I mean if youre not having fun that's reason enough to stop
neutral means...?
give me some leeway
so
but anyways ive gotten like. 2 hours of sleep in the last two days im not 100% here
hey jett are you feeling the same way?
so I will
I could
or not. idk
id reckon that means jett is out as well
O O F
im ok with early
we die
that does work for me as im working Saturday this week
yall have a time in mind for this week or do you want to play camp pain another time?
faded into the ether
then they disappeared
welp
multiple personality disorder
I misread ducheys as douchys
also that questionmark means?
did you ever describe whats to our east or is it the same as whats in the north
End my suffering
maybe he locked himself out again
despite the time being set by the person who isn't here
I think we're not gonna do campaign today
I don't think milo is here either
I guess I should have bet on everyone else for wholefoods
yes
Whole paycheck 
mars
that works for me
and apparently jetts silence means yes. and ill never get used to that
mars?
sounds like sunday is the best for three of us
I don't have to get her anything right?
Edited previous message: for your moms bday?<e_m ts="1529541022" ts_ms="1529541023192" a="parsa.jourx" t="61"/>
for your mom's bday?
which now is off the table
if we have to play Friday it has to be later in the day
yo dawg I heard you like raging
:/
We’re still expecting payday from the prince
My net worth has just been gutted
say hi
were in call with you man
i don't see you on r20
I’ll be on time
Wholefoods has been cancelled
I may be wholefoods 
I expect 6 pm
I eat like a normal fucking person
eat
to
need
we
to fucking eat
to eat mars
MARS
so id reckon we would go there because SOMEONE INSISTS THAT WE LIVE ON THE CHEAP
as for any other introductions idk maybe have it organic
its a cornerstone in my backstory to know mars
or would we simply get introduced to them in the town
should we include how we know the other 2 folks?
neither did i
do we want to rework backstory mars to accommodate this most recent change?
we are going light on them heals then. don't get hit everybody
we have a fighter, a rogue, and a ranger
mars im worried
and I thought we said sunday
you know that is essentially wholefoods
we really need to cast a wide net huh?
yall think about 5 or 6pm would be good?
sunday I think everyone has got something going on for the first few hours of the day
or sunday
on monday
time idk
incredibles Monday
we should wait for eric and see what he has to day on this matter
fathers day in my family is usually a single meal thing
as am i
and i can do sunday
if we have to delay dnd the next day im available is thursday
i cannot do tuseday
that hasn't always been true
idk about mars or jett
i think eric said yes
I said I could, as did you
im not even sure if everyone confirmed for monday
I assumed so
does uti's arrival mean were not game Monday?
milo
in other words im asking about dnd
I have this week off before I start working
he did
and I can play anytime now
im home
The best part is no one is gonna see it too
I knew that mang
… or are they both the same
in which case whats the name of the princedom?
unless that's his name
I don't think you included the name of the prince of aleese
q
what kind of racist shit is that
you kinda just don't let them into your island
they are slaves.
I mean so am I but at least my culture has a place for foreigners.
OH NO HES A FOREIGNER
or maybe that's just me
and would know LESS than them
tbh some of us aren't normal citizens
idk maybe some travelling ronin and he can name drop some  places we haven't been to
i have no clue what milo is planning with his backstory except he knows Lysandre somehow
speaking of which I have no clue what that is
that's a thing you should do at home, especially since it doesn't pertain to the current path the party is going
if i had to guess, he wanted to draw dicks on it
did it work?
that's the best i got man
i can use the snipping tool but it will be super low res
so if it was retrievable somewhere else on my computer i can post it here and you can have it that way
i think its not a file you can retrieve unless it is actually posted into a chat
I tried to do something similar with a skype icon and I couldn't figure it out
how much bling will jett have
id figure its lost to us
the ring idk jett didn't specifically say he took it
it was a pact sword, which disappears when I die or after 1 min more than 5ft away from me
the sword goes away when I do
well that was pointless
im playing tw so I should be good to go at any time
so we all good for tomorrow at 7 right?
and its not working imo
the system isn't meant to be realistic its mean to be fun
im just saying the system itself isn't accomplishing what it was meant to do now
im not ragging on you jett
ik now it feels more like an annoyance and less like something we have to even consider
if im being honest any and all difficulty with it vanished the moment jett realized he could break the system with purify food and water
since we're planning on playing Friday I figured I would ask how everyone liked the travelling system eric cooked up
what
umm
thats Texan textbooks' job
youre being dumb and now im going to stop talking and do my homework
so that means you can right?
you didn't fucking mention it
can you play right now?
how about today then?
that doesn't mean than any other day is fine
thats retarded
that's retarded
Edited previous message: nor did we hear anything from jett relating to friday<e_m ts="1527730399" ts_ms="1527730399749" a="parsa.jourx" t="61"/>

i did say that and i meant it.
dw ill be fine i mean what the hell is gonna happen at your party man
i used to live 80 miles away from anyone i knew while being trapped with 2 frat douches who made my skin crawl. i learned how to deal with people i hate
because I don't hate you. if I did I wouldn't be going
im going for you
that's retarded
im not going to your birthday for them milo
also damnit milo when is your fakkin party
I remember that sunday was our first option then something came up
why aren't we doing sunday again
all I know is its a shitstorm about when we are playing
and ill be honest I didn't read any of the shit you guys said up in the chat
20
so
and I think milo is older than me

and just a quick question we are certain we are doing late night Monday?
i don't know what that is
I uhh
we will see
I could try that
but as it is unreliable I don't think we should schedule around that
usually we leave at about 3 and get there at 6ish
which varies when they have time
when my parents decide to drive me
ITS NOT WORTH IT
MARS
mars
mars
as far as rescheduling goes
but id like to wait and see what others have to say
we are by no means obligated to play this weekend
and do it later
we could just delay
to dodge your work
or earlier
we could start later on sunday
we could ummm
long shift or something?
why does sun not work for you again mars?
its honestly just sat and sun for me
or monday
but not early friday
so the entire weekend I'm free
umm
in which case the compendium is probably enough
unless youre not a spellcaster
well
if you want to see more indepth options available you have to use another site
which is like... their best spell
they don't even have warlock hex
if you only use r20 compendium you don't get all the options

you cant drag on from the compendium since you didn't buy it
whoever wants to turn it on can
I honestly think the facecams will be enough imo
reveal wont have an impact
your WOWZERS SHES A GRIL
you could honestly just play that character
Bs I'm not racist

so we can see expressions and gestures
how about facecam next time we do dnd
but they are all Warhammer shit
honestly I have a metric fuckton of minis
damb
do you want to actually do an irl thing and actually be in the same room and roll real dice
so since I'm gonna be in santa monica next week when we are doing dnd
it was a joke
its not happening tomorrow
just because you are amongst retards doesn't mean you have to become retarded to match them
proper diction is important
autistic*
MAAAAAAAAAAARS?

Monday I'm off from school
at like... 7ish
so are we in it for Friday?
well that's the thing isn't it we're doing just that
but would yall be ok with playing late night?
i mean i can play
ish
Friday i will be in a car until like.... 7
idk ill wait for others to put forth ideas
sunday perhaps
maybe later that weekend
we could play a later time
all the same
and i saw it on my way to the party
i remember because there was a car accident on montana that day
I remember he had one last year
wowie no party? what is he? me?
he didn't invite me <ss type="tongueout">:p</ss>
I wouldn't know
I'm back home for that
are we good for then?
next weekend is memorial day weekend
so this weekend is out
idk
umm
so monk bullshit gives you 2 perception?
I bet its because YOURE A HERETIC
is this a monk thing
how do you have 15 passive perception with only 14 wis and no profeciency
I'm at 13
wait for real ik someone has passive perception higher than mine
proficiency in perception?
lul
keen mind at 8 int
I have magic bullshit eyes but they only work at night so idk how helpful I would be for any of these tasks
Not to mention that we already have a map
5 duties and only 4 people to do them
Or you get cholera
Mars roll constitution save
And see how frustrated we get
All the same we’re on the road next session so let’s try Eric’s prepare to die mode
Goodberry actually does hydrate you
I’m down to try Eric’s hardcore mode for a session before I make a choice on wether I like it or not
Because casting is BALANCED 
And besides warlock and pally aren’t offered it so we will never have to deal with it
Then honestly it’s balanced
Goodberry is fine if you make it consume materials
I need my NUTRITION 
Mars my nutrients are in those açaí berries
MAAAARS we don’t have goodberry to ez mode that shit
bs I'm not racist
nibba ask him
so the earliest I can play idk about him is the next coming saturday
I have midterms
jett has prom
jett and I cannot play this saturday
no time WERE KILLING ORKS
MAGICAL HORSESHIT FUCKING WITH MY ASTRONOMY
SILENCE HERETIC I WONT HEAR IT FROM YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
he had 8
WHAT KIND OF BARBARIAN ARE YOU
YOU WERE SPEAKING USING PROPER DICTION
I thought you showed yourself not to be retarded
we were all exposed to your unrepentant heresy
EXCUSES
EXCUSES
in a really dumb way
you said it
what time saturday
ok
so your confusion is understandible
i also remember it not being spoken in your presence
I remember that
it was spoken
internet back
My school internet is down
Well
Me ok with today as well
Me want Saturday 
then we wait I guess until one or both of them have rekindled interest
so do you want to play before then or not until then
main just isn't happening for a minimum of half a month
in full
I thought you were ok with running minis until we get back
the fact of the matter is we don't know when THEY want to play
they both said no man
so you said this weekend or next eric?
what
umm
I can play then
ill be home next week
they don't have a time planned
that's just the issue
I'm dead inside and will now retire

ill be honest I didn't read a few of the dynasty demigods
campaign when
okei
tomorrow 3
yes
I cannot do sunday
we could do that morning thing we did last time
or thurs
probably saturday
so
I'm assuming were doing mars on friday
yes
which means hes leaning towards something else
he said that's the most castery he would get
then what you got planned?
if no caster
you right gemi best waifu
because eric overtuned his waifu to be too stronge
6 til we tpk?
well the build is going to be battlemaster fighter with sword and board
well if everyone is rerolling no one can fucking make fun of me for making a new character
other than erics power fantasy for his waifu
how I imagined carius' coronation
a nice wholesome meme at 12 in the morning'
for all the vermintide boys out there

well
DRAKKI BEST TANK
I will continue to talk shit

well
I would like to wait for 4:20 on the dot as my roommate is asleep and I'm working on something
im studying until were ready
I'm here
which is good
phys is last
which is gay
fucking ochem is first
mon tuse wed
Saturday 11-2 I'm in review session for ochem
so we can tally it all up to cowardice, weakness, and stupidity
well it looks like you misspelled weakness as well
it only takes 3 minutes to expose your cowardice
I could do 3 hours but 5 seems much
as I'm on the fence about playing as well
if hes out I think It would be best to delay
I was just talking to milo and he was unsure if he can do it
it has to be after 3
if I do
what time?
I just don't want to lose a whole day doing campaign
but I can take breaks
chem
yall can play thurs w/out me
all the same
I do not agree
suck
quarters
again
for yall maybe
or just week before finals week
not no class
dead week means nothing new in lecture
WHICH IS IN 5 FUCKING DAYS
and in DEADWEEK we are learning things in lecture for the FUCKING FINAL
because you didn't have midterms week 8 of fucking 9
because youre not in quarter system
you don't have anywhere NEAR as many tests
DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND WHAT BULLSHIT IM GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW
YES
YES
YES
but I cannot play this week
yall can do without me
no
ummm
I'm in deadweek man

ill be honest I was expecting a response

I mean the post was followed by
you FOOL
its meant to be targetted
krappa
have him be immensely stupid
he deader than the fucking dcu
nibba he dead
so I'm good
well
he is already super dead and in 2 pieces rn
fucking put up
i dont
if its not magic i can beat anyone ANYONE
real shit square up thot ill beat him down at any level
hoe put up I'm not scurred
and i would have won harder
he wouldn't be able to keep me out of his range then, which means his retarded cheese strat wouldn't have worked
but with boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooows
its the SAME THING
do you know what great weapon mastery is?
did you finally close eluras milo?
which is why shooting ppl with advantage on them is like.. important or something
but since everything has like 19 ac, hitting is kinda hard
you get to not suck
if you weren't dumb like me and didn't take crossbow expert, instead opting to use that shit on a bow,
its not fair but it does require you to use the sharpshooter fighter archetype
but with a -5 to hit
at fighter level 10 those in combination give me a 22 damage mod
steady aim and sharpshooter
that's because youre racist
well
on Jamaica avenue?
what?
that pescado smell
oh wait i got that taco smell
I'm at the taco bell
Edited previous message: i got that pizza butt<e_m ts="1520993216" ts_ms="1520993216799" a="parsa.jourx" t="61"/>
i got that pizza but
I got that pizza gut

Confirmed boys it DOESNT MEAN ANYTHING 
don't know what that means
i
in gilderion
theres no fucking h
that's wrong
umm
gilderion is just a false flag
his real name is rook
I think
BIGGUS DICKUS
was
his name
and so is milo
oh hey eric is back
ROOK
IS
FUCK
THE
WHO
but the real question is
heresy
where did mars go again?
your heresy will not go unpunished
maybe too much red for him to see
I think
before he died
I mean I showed him the sunset
strategy is the fanciest way to say cowardice
he never did more than 7 damage in a single attack
he did 80 damage in poking and proding
I was at 1/3
who is he?
but dey don' know. dat de cleva, GET DA CLEAVA!
and I'm not
but hes dead
many coward think they are clever
but he just coward
manswine thought himself clever
its ok
negative
define
we all have to prepare something to say?
?
i wanted to rename all your planets to dumb shit
I cant edit it
did we even all agree to do this one Friday?
no?
umm
so we're not doing this one on Friday as we are going to make characters for mars' space murder adventure?
and if I do Friday it has to be later in the day
so I'm not doing thurs
at 2-3
midterm friday
its just one legendary resist man
resistant to everything but psychic wut?
SHE'Z DA 'ARD UN
YOOZ GOTZ ONE OF DEM DEMON FINGS IN YA 'EAD
YOOZ NOT 'ARD YAH GIT
and homeboy was like no I don't like you get fucked
he wanted to be teleported somewhere
and you would have actually gotten to see your mom
maybe you should have chilled that murderboner for like idk 3 fucking days
ordo malleus will do in a pinch
preferably ordo hereticus
contact your nearest inquisitor
sounds heretical
see a physician
CONTROL YOUR HORMONES

Which one of us inherited a strong, cultured kingdom? And which one of us had to rise up against a kingdom with nothing but a horde of starving slaves? Which one of us was a child enslaved on a world of monsters, with his brain cut up by carving knives? Listen to your blue-clad wretches yelling of courage and honour, courage and honour, courage and honour. Do you even know the meaning of those words? Courage is fighting the kingdom which enslaves you, no matter that their armies outnumber yours by ten-thousand to one. You know nothing of courage. Honour is resisting a tyrant when all others suckle and grow fat on the hypocrisy he feeds them. You know nothing of honour.
an elf is born when two men touch tips
theres a giant golden-armored human I would like you to meet
the true inheritors of the world claimed what was rightfully theirs
twas not heresy, but manifest destiny
he need not know what heresy was conducted
ABSOLUTELY HERETICAL
how heretical
and you didn't put the vile witches to the torch
the only one ive seen in character is that steward
because I CANT FUCKING TELL
we have to do a perception check to see what gender it is
also yeah I think whenever we encounter an elf
Brother Mars. Lay the emperor's beat on this heretic
I'm all for virus bombing craftworlds
its ok when we purge filthy xenos
desire to purge increases
then it is subhuman
is it not human?
yes
I'm not sure what that is
he needs to know what the fuck do yall do
how terrifying
stahp
and I will not stop saying that its dumb
but really the fucking super saiyan thing hes got going on is fucking dumb
couldn't have said it better myself
PULLING A FUCKIN' JETT?
10 minutes late

meanwhile hes hiding behind a rock jerking himself offf
he knocks ppl prone
i did just make him a tank for me

hey eric is there a way to counterspell a fireball in such a way that it only hits like... a particular area
honestly raising him as a zombie doesn't seem like there would be much difference
HAHHHHHHHHHHH goteem
you mean play like AN ENORMOUS PUSSY
reaching critical mass
murderous intent rising
I for one welcome our imperial overlords

ewwwwwwwwwwwww
instead of veiny it would be viney
freak
but you would probably just grow it back
I was about to threaten you with removing your... extra appendages
as if
fuck off immediatly
are probably here
and people who answer it
just hit that little phone button
nvm
oh
but mars is at work probably
and I think miles is shitposting in the other chat
you know I am
well
Ave Imperator
so just pretend
but I don't have teeth
if I could bare teeth and sneer scram I would
I could attune the robes to make 3
yeah only 2 items
but ill check
the amulet and staff
I think I've got 2
and why it works
and also the mind reading ought to give pravaal insight on why what I'm saying is right
doesn't the staff give the user an understanding of all magic
meaning that they actually have an understanding of spells and magic, unlike warlocks who are gifted the power and sorcerers who are just... kinda good at what they do even though they have no fucking clue how they do it
as their shit is in a spell book
i think wizards ought to be the best suited for that
cant I teach spells?
soz
i would rather make a spooky scary skeleton than a league streamer
as in I learned nothing because devil magic ate my memory
it told me to fuck off
however fucking long that will take
I'm just gonna go ahead and add all compendium spells
oh miles did we tell you youre lvl 8 now?
look upon the heart?
no
bruh
mars we can hear your breathing
in other words. no more shopping campaign until after we kill things in the cave
we'z not in da' keep no more boyz. WE'Z GOIN' AFTER DAT MONSTA' IN DA CAVE
YOU FFFFFFFFFFFFFAKING IDIOT
as I said
YOU FFFFFFFFFFFAKING IDIOT
on couches and chairs
900,000 dollars
I for one welcome our new imperial overlords
he'll just set them on fire and call it a day
don't have gemi enchant any of the furniture
alright
I think its boah
I'm not sure how to spell boy with a southern twang
DONT COME AT ME WITH THAT &quot;BIG GAY&quot; BOAH
itll be like being a cave troll being a prick to 4 helpless idiots on the internet
just cover yourself and the screen with a  blanket and itll be good
idk
also I feel like with my mic yall might hear eric
ill be able to cheat like hell
is mars ok with that?
tell the other guys to fuck off for tomorrow
but really are we doing this one or yours milo?
how bad can it be? he says before CHAOS INVADES
you already set up one serial killer arc
right whatever
riiiiiiiiight. yeah there are a lot of rapes to keep track of
honestly there are a lot of rapes that happen in that comic
was that the horse one?
seems Donovan man
you liked Donovan raping guts?
no real shit if you fucking blast my headset with screams I will actually tear your tongue out
fucking degenerate
eww how could you be ok with earrape
anything before that is just fine
in an rpg I draw the line at earrape
in an rpg?
uggggggggggggh
if you play as his faction the fucking place you fight over is actually renamed borealum
I just watched the games ending
wait
and they made a joke out of it
and people thought it was a place
instead of boreale, he said BOREALUM
there is a game where a voice actor who had a funny voice said his characters name wrong
BOREALUM
are we eatin' babies here or in eluras onthursday?
SOMEBODY HAS EATEN ALL DA BAEIBIES
cuz that's just a big headache
^
I thought they were spess mehreens

iron warriors style

I don't care its an abomination
not fucking leperosy
I imagined it to actually be a damn tattoo
that leaf shit is actually grotesque
at high noon
but ill defer to the most popular
I personally like the other one
good joke
do you have to set up the bay of ikea or does it come pre-assembled?
its raining shekels hallelujah
mars gets it
even... tho they kinda suck
lakers now and forever
purple with a gold trim however is the realest shit
yellow is a ghastly color. demands too much attention. gold is gaudy but at least it isn't as bright
twice as appalling
leaning 4 I don't like blond hair
really I don't like any but if forced to choose I'm thinking between 4 and 5
give me a sec
umm
don't talk shit about the boi
hoe

also disguisedtoast number1 bae
how bout for someone who doesn't watch or has never watched offlinetv?
xp acquired ?
did this all start after I asked for a valentines day campaign?
valentines day campaign special?
yeah id say it prefers elves
in addition to the whole.... killing everything else bit? that the sword does?
you went with more of a thorny sword right?
cmon bruh
how heretical
you were spamming
but I think you remembered them yourself
I was about to flame you for the retarded noises you were making earlier today
but that's RUUUUUUUUUUUDE
I'm still here
idk
genius
sweet
rip
soooooooooo Thursday after 3 right?
aside from that, I doubt I can do much
or weekends
or Fridays after 2
I could do tuse or thurs after 3
warning earrape
cyka
cyka
cyka
again
were waiting on mars
soooooooooo
only me and miles
i think
I can
because plague doctors are sick as fuck
as a spoopy bird person
necromancy focus
wizard
I prefer 3
okei
is bootyful
a long long time ago
yesh
the other two are mute as per usual
I don't think anyone is here lol
or yall are really using up those 2 minutes
I think everyone is asleep
One hangover more than enough then?
Unless mars plans on being shitfaced again tomorrow 
We’re all good for tomorrow right?
don't fucking get me killed again
I don't have an idea for a next character you dingus
technically it works out lol
What was the last thing you remember being awake for atlas?
we'll see if they show up
just making sure we're all good for 8pm
so youre saying you basically built your character to be antagonizing
I haven't learned how to sell my soul at a premium
I didn't tell her that
we're all good guys here
while he isn't looking
unfortunately i am white so i wouldn't get away with it ill be slapped by the pc police
didn't he fuck off to his own planet of clones
and that's normal
ok so he tries to pin murdering the fire lady on us but we stopped it and saved her and now we're on our way out of the city
mars isn't a necessity. as can be seen from the last two weeks
he was a goodboy amongst psychos I don't think it would be conceivable to play a character like that
So I found out I’m good for tomorrow
we cant hear you
if youre talking
nope he was part of it
we did violently butcher 20 farmsworth of peasents
shouldn't be any problem for us
well... we already have experience purging the weak grim
so that is something I intend to acquire
but she needs souls
and feel that I will play the character far tamer than mars would
I resent that statement
have we decided if we're waiting for mars?
if youre seated why are you fucking talking to us
I want to stab everyone and gut them like fishes to see how they work on their insides
to saying he will be late
goes from wanting to start early
acquire souls get shiny stabby bits
not so much
spell saves umm
his ac is good
nope my ring
thus is the pact
now you want it
you put a ring on it
now?
umm
since mars isn't at work?
we wanted to start early this week no?
because that's retarded
silence isn't giving the affirmative
that isn't a thing
we had 3 last week as well tho no?
nobody saying anything
that would require me to transcend my physical and mental limitations to become the perfect being
I could never be as gay, black, or fat as sky
Your dementia is great at making cyphers mars
As I am enjoying a meal at fatburger I don’t have much recourse but to agree
You’re dumb
didn't see that coming
tomorrow means sunday?
Are we game this week?
im good for it
Not to mention they are on another fucking continent
But the thing is we probably didn’t have the hardware to get the damn things
I mean ofc it was
Purple= gives you tits and and kills you again
Green= plant monster
Edited previous message: I think we're almost game<e_m ts="1532832573" ts_ms="1532832573846" a="parsa.jourx" t="61"/>
I think we're almost gamer
stop
workibg: already started drinking
get that money for those sandwiches
good
go to work
mars
a scholar amongst his people?
I would like to molest a homeless man to find the &quot;evil&quot;
oh and does our paladin know he got a new toy without having to do anything?
trust me everyone just don't ask questions and hate him
but its ok to hate him
no one knows who that is
so needy
im good
ahahahahhahahHAHAHAH
we could just take a break one week
is this shift for this week or from now on?
tough
this is the part where you tell us right?
^good Persian food
^bad Persian food
im good
pull down your hoodie and leave the Arizona at work
I DONT CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARE
why do you bother explaining this to him you know he wont ever admit to anything
no ask milo
and 401k
take advantage of your sick pension
how bout just quit mars
123
party tension aside
did yall enjoy session 2?
bwaahhhhh
grim is your connection alright?
i don't comprehend that
no
lol?
umm
Ok 
Om
I got off late at work
Are we in?
Umm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmok
yes
assuming I get off at when im supposed to
but I will probably want to die
ill still make it at 8
and its supposed to be a bad schedule
I am working this saturday
have we got another time?
go back to cryostasis we cant have you thaw out now and start coughing
I’m pretty sure we’re good to go
I as a person do not comprehend the idea that there is such a thing as AM
I wont work this Saturday so any time is good for me
he only has one gear and that is to drive into a wall.
I did like it when someone who had 6 dex wrote into his backstory that he was hit in the leg during a fight which never fully healed
how the pc carries itself shouldn't be affected by stats.
yet the barb still talked and acted like an idiot
we had a barbarian with higher int then the warlock
I always thought statlines shouldn't affect how you rp a character
did we have a time for our first game?
im not working today
also eat shit mars
I woke up 20 min ago. give me a break
she was at milos party
its a socal thing I think
and actually start next week
I think we should all just group up for the character creation this week
Edited previous message: <e_m ts="1530308352" ts_ms="1530308352978" a="parsa.jourx" t="61"/>
are they on the r20?
so I have seen.
oh no wait I think Saturday still doesn't work for eric
shit
umm
oh
but I think sunday works for eric, mars, and myself.
but I think at that point mars is just starting his job. Im pst
im working this Saturday til 5 (assuming no overtime)
that depends on scheduling right?
ehh
the druid
we met one
dont be so prejudiced
heretics
meaning you have a lore-fitting reason to pick up that race
goliaths live up there
also goliaths
if you do you should also know a little something something about the north
in the first campaign I made a dex fighter battlemaster
thanks for saving me multiple times with it btw
lol mars built his character on one of the worst feats in the game
im an edgy underdark ranger. i shoot people real good. for the first round of combat. then im just worse then all the other archtypes.
no whammies?
it should be mentioned that mars and i rolled for stats. i don't know if eric expects you to do the same so...
kidnapped... right... our first major mission was to fucking murder a child who was rumored to have magical powers for this country's version of the police (Justicars are angry paladins who are pricks.)
and the like
dragonborn
i know dwarves exist
umm... questions for eric. I mean elves were supposed to not exist but my character is muckin about. if you do pick one of the weirder races you might want to keep it hidden from npcs and even other players as to prevent your untimely and very bloody demise
and now I hope I didn't scare any of you with that lore dump
oh and eric apparently ranger magic is under the divine tag. which is why its dumb.
SUNLIGHT FOR LIFE
because they suck
they are a bunch of HERETICS and they come down south to raid and pillage and other barbarous things that people who don't worship the son do.
and lastly, to the north there exists another country called velarn I think. I forgot its name.
these items are sought after by the princes and nobles of the kingdom, and they frequently war with one another to acquire more
weapons and armor that basically turn their wearers into veritable demigods on the battlefield
and the last two major worldbuilding bits are that, in this setting, there exists extremely powerful artifacts called dawnblades and dawnplate
but that last one is dumb
this doesn't include magic that comes from gods, like paladins, clerics, and TECHNICALLY rangers
commoners who are shown to have some magical prowess and aren't good at keeping them hidden usually disappear as the higher class wants to keep up the idea that only nobles have the capability to cast magic
arcanist magic like wizardry, sorcery, and the like are considered to be exclusively available to nobility
that isn't to say elves don't exist in the setting, as im playing a drow
elves have been gone from this place for several thousand years, and the humans in this region believe that elves used to enslave all other races.
its a human kingdom, with some slight tendencies toward xenophobia
alright
I know a bit about the setting as well, if you want me to try to explain it alongside you eric
yes
yes
Im Michael im also in the game
well done
