send milo these links since he never checks skype
yea. the only thing im still interested in that game is journey mode
wasnt really in the mood for terraria after taking a look at the game tbh
aight
you wanna join him or do smth else
like an old world or smth?
terraria/league?
join us
on league with parsa
aight you good
^
you game?

wdyd these days anyway. no work or going outside anymore right
and im tryna get some terraria or mc in
well idk sleep later cause i dont finish working on my project till like 9 usually and somehow everyones on a boomer schedule now
they really aren't. i get up for work 945 and its shit
ngl thats pretty gay
fuckin boomer
yo game?
we're 4/5 for league get on
?
ik milos boomered out but you tryna game
league
well. true. you or milo tryna play league
but hopefully corona gets them either way xd
fuck the police but fuck the looters worse you know
theyre like 99% inner city black kids
idk. i think itd be fine. lock down the city and shoot the out of towners
fair
its just the shitty chain stores anyway
imo they shouldve started shooting the looters but whatever
i kinda wish i was in the group chat to see gwyns take but i feel like thats recipe for headache
incredible
hows it down by the promenade
yo
league
aint your dad here
league
in like an hour or two
ay do you and milo wanna go hiking with nathan
level
ay
WoW?
aight
WoW./
aight its been a solid 24 hours. you ready
k
yo league?
cause theres a 2x xp thing rn apparently
did you ever convince milo to start wow
some time after this week. i have all my finals and shit
nig come back
aight
league or aom with parsa
next day hours
im with parsa on league. would duck game but i already fucked mars there yesterday
game
so at 11th level with 20 int you can have 16 spells prepped to cast and on a long rest you can swap any of them for others in the book
which you can switch for the ones you have prepared on a long rest
also the way the spellbook works is you can only have X spells prepared but any amount in the book
cool. does it lead to any specific eccentricity like a fascination with plants or poisons. a preference for fresh meat or smth. rp stuff you feel
aight. as you flesh the character out you should refer to these events and any lessons learned from them or stories. what about i guess intellectual focuses. wizards tend to be smart and learned so is his focus on the arcane itself and its nature, or something more specific like world relgions or history of a continent
should be like 1-2 feats of significant badassery
aight. any important past adventures. like how did he acquire his robe and amulets and reach level 11
bamdul spoke of a crazy bitch
drawn to lucia then
searching for lichdom i see
he's academy trained so he knows the various members of the council of tides
aight
can be as flashy or normal as you want
aight. i meant more like do they just arrive at the door or do they meet him on the road or what
as far as intros go how do you wanna do it
yea you can change the rod. for all items tho short rest is 1 day, if its a dawn/full rest item then its 7 days
for all
and roll 4d6d1
do custom
though note that your 3 attunement slots are used
'fun' uncommon or common items or consumables if you want
and everyone has random items drifting around their sheet so you can take a couple of the 
those seem ok. you should note though that since we're doing 1 week rests, the robe and rod recharge at the 7th dawn, not every dawn
for an 11th level wizard you should have traveled enough to have more than just the level-up spells in your spellbook so you can add like any 15 extra of your choice and say those are the ones you copied down while adventuring or studying. i cant think of any hard and fast rules for magic items but you can put forth like 1 very rare item and 1-2 rare, and it should be chill
pretty much every official spell is in the compendium now so its not too bad grabbing the ones you need
lore master is fine if you want
which wizard school are you thinking
yea its under bamdul's
yea. you can even say hes smithing thanatos's gem into something
for like switching fighting style or sorc spells. those are fair game imo since you can academy train those
basically i think just mystic got dropped actually. theres a variant features list which is just straight buffs too
yea but none of the removed content from it
alternatively, you could build a second character for the interludes and see which you like more. whatever works best you feel
yea think about it. if you wanna swap characters or feats lmk. theres also very likely a second interlude session before carim so you have like a week
theres also downtime to 'academy train' and swap feats or smth if you want. whichever approach makes it better
yea thats unfortunate. idk if the enemy size is going to change much when it comes to monsters but outside the underworld theres more humanoids
like its an axe blade hit, then as a bonus action you morph it into the fist and grapple
besides flavor it should. the weapon just morphs when you hit so like you hit then morph
btw milo mentioned you may not be fully into playing bamdul so if you wanna turn him to an npc or smth chilling and crafting at the estate rn is a good time. thanatos's gem might help too since it gives a weapon +2 and a vorpal-like enchantment. if you wanna swap tho i can make a new sheet and either move your magic items over or choose from some equivalents idk
you and milo should answer mars in camp nigma so he doesnt prep for nothing
wanna see if the boys are down for aom or duck game
ok. come in disc when youre done
you down?
aight
league or smth
game?
good. do flex or norms to hate yourself more
aight do you hate yourself yet
you should
i mena
nothing to do rn
league
wanna duck game while it fixes
negus
game?

wiat. you think we can get people to play pummel party
ngl
real fuckin bored
civ6 and all expansions worth 50 bucks?
can make it full combat but i thought thatd be cooler
aight. also i designed the arm to be mostly creation focused. e.g. it has a multitool and can interface with the omnismelter to have it create larger objects. small combat boost like the ability to coat a transformed weapon in harmonic copper or just deal an additional d6 on unarmed
when are you coming back to town
etc
wack game
risk of rain
or aoe2
you wanna get some people for age of myth

i think some people are on board and some arent
She offered to work with the party provided they give her the dagger for a year or two to conquer Hakone, then she'll provide them with an army or anything else they need to raid azure peak
the short version is she's trying to find Leitnaught so she can kill her mother and her clan head and become head of the Shino clan which is 1 of the 4 major Nihon clans. After which she'll use the dagger to create an army of hexblades to conquer Nihon and then the rest of Hakone, planting herself as empress
i think you just missed them talking to rei on the boat and then them renaming the boat because &quot;the empire red&quot; wasnt fitting

Sup?
Sup?
cya
ye
ye. i think the road back to daggercourt will be more chilling
i think miles wouldve liked it
the campaign
dynamic lighting and lag
which was like 75% dungeons
true you missed Black Empire
speaking of i really didnt want it to end so bleakly
just the angel and Omega are like the whole plot point of this town
yea i usually try to not put important npcs
i dont remember any recurring aid but yea
im gonna try to force talking time somehow
yea idk how to do it in character
should i start forcing people to talk about their backgrounds with each other
anything i should steal
hows it
you guys still on league?
and natural for goliath's to be innately connected to their birth-mountains
Greater rune of the mountain. both enduring and tied to metal and earth
Precise is probably closer than swift
I was going to suggest enduring. Or swift
im trying to think of a word to sum this person up
more like a warrior than a soldier id guess
penny's tenacity in fights
e.g. lautrec's unnatural luck
ok. is there something in your characters life that theyve always seemed unnaturally good at. some trait of theirs that defines them
or reveal it a little ways in
so since everyone else has their rune do you want your character to start with it
by black mountain where the dwarves live
from this backstory im assuming hes from the northern mountains
and going out to confront them
hearing about the old tribe and realizing its his
i think thats a great arc 
or has he come around to his sister's leadership
so about his tribe is he still hung up on getting them back
i like it
but also the innate goliath individuality and freedom
so he has the trappings of civilization from dwarves like reading and writing and a sense of heirarchy and order
arright i get it
while goliath lawful is more spirit of the law and personal ethical code
dwarven lawful is more letter of the law
actually goliaths are also lawful by nature
lawful then?
but with a bit of dwarven civilization and law
alright. put it in the chat and see if it fits the tone everyone else wants. is he going to be like the typical goliaths where they talk about tribe and loyalty
what about previous ties, enemies, organizations, etc
etc
or explore and find rare metals
aight. so is his motivation to become a master smith?
im sure that can be explained as hunting experience
yea its fine. im honestly ok with any character that works well with the party
7ft?
goliath is fine i think. whats their size
wtf
Ah. I'm pretty much back if you wanna wait
Ay I got held up. 20 minutes ish ya
League in 45? Walking home
on it
yea
aight
no violent is like when you take an action you have a chance to gain another action
yea. your choice
yea. despair and violent are good all around
has to be a rolled attack
aight. it is attacks tho so like eldritch blast
eternal is lifesteal and bonus to death saves, chance to come back up right away when hitting 0
violent
violent is you know
despair is chance to force a save against being stunned
chance to slip into the ethereal plane during combat and move there until the start of your next round when you deal bonus damage on the first attack
so when they die you heal as well
corruption is chance to deal damage over time and mark them
all of them are chance to do X
anyway if youre committed to that ill attach it to the main rune. lmk soon
Aight. It gives a chance to crit when you hit 5 over their ac and your natural crits a chance to deal omega damage
Jett pick a rune. It's part of yours. Corruption, cruelty, despair, eternal, unseen, or violent
gdi
reinstall cuck
with ronald?
league
You could even ask the party
Sure. It's debatable. Ultimately you decide if you want to take Nathaniel up or not
straight up murder-&gt;bad
causing an accident that kills someone-&gt;good
all devils prefer things done in the legal grey area
just pointing out that chaotic acts arent her thing
yea you could
and shes a devil so by definition is a lawful deity
also she wants people to be driven to desperation so they turn to her
acts that please your patron increase your concordance and make intervention more likely. also it makes her more likely to offer help and less likely to end you
so basically friendship
he didnt make a formal offer, just implied he would make it worth your time
so that he can buy it up cheap
the star item is an ancient relic of their house, the Ring of Stars. He wants you to spread misinformation and convince the nobles that the ring is fake or weak or whatever else that will make them low bid on it
and he has an offer regarding the auction
At the same time though, you met nathaniel hagan at the ball
potentially? theyre not really on the brink of shattering. they still have a seat on the High Council, theyre just short on liquid funds. 
to be held the next week
you also learn about House Daemir holding an auction of art and heirlooms to pay off some of their debts and rebuild their estate which partially burned
even supplying arms and armor could help them
it doesnt have to be now but theyre willing to be allies if you can provide them either of those things
like they made bad investments and couldnt defend all their banks from the riots
right now they look weak
like they need a better image
they need guards and strength to better defend their banks, as well as more public goodwill
 24 persuasion 11 deception gets you onto the Leighton's guest list and into their ball. They do catch on that youre trying to infiltrate them but even then the Leightons are potentially interested in an alliance. Their head was murdered first by the Pale Assassin and their banks aren't doing great after some unlucky events. theyre still a great house but on the downswing
did you have a specific house youre trying to get in with
but aight
gay
aight
you wanna play some league
?
league or risk of rain
risk of rain?
yea. lesson learned
just unlucky i guess
but that might be too slow which is why i did the rally but it got sidetracked
i want to do smaller events like a street brawl or riot or like a merchant caravan being in town
the dwarf likes you and is willing to join
thats a good plan lol
tbh i think i scuffed the session. i wanted house hresvelg to be your main rivals and riegan just an old enemy but i dont think it came out like that
yea exactly. he clearly has a grudge for some reason
that was some real character understanding
i like the way you described your hatred for riegan btw
aight. im just collecting opinions rn
yo how much of the handouts do you read and is it helpful with establishing setting or just a waste of time
where you at
bruh
earliest i can get there is like 10
how late are you running your party
ofc
smart
actually fierna is a good choice. archdevil of control over others
?
so your warlock is bent chaos through law then
so do you want to talk about your patron
btw theres a handout about a rusted family spear left to you
ye
Well, let me know<context suggestionId="84666d8a-4a4c-43f2-aa9a-17729e1fd45a" impressionGuid="83B6AC07635349709B6683535DC4401F" serviceTag="A5D4BE15554546EE98AB42B5A172386C" clientId="EECA83E5CAA84564ACEC13AE55ED141F" serviceTraceId="815823526F2C4B6183F48066CA60D329" suggestionType="Reply" providerId="cortana"></context>
whats your character's name going to be
Ya no don't come it's aids
Tbh I am just trying to remove the shield for balance lol
More like a +1 of special metal and precision/brutal upgrade
It won't be a +3 also tho
Also if you want you can trade the shield for an heirloom weapon 
Aight cool. You can make a new character or just change the backstory
So you mars or miles should be the heir
Anyway Milo and Parsa both didn't want to play the nobleman heir and I was going to have everyone rewrite their backstory to tie them into the city somehow
Anyway Milo and Parsa both didn't want to play the nobleman heir and I was going to have everyone rewrite their backstory to tie them into the city somehow
And you're trying to work up to the throne
Basically you're nobles in a destitute house
This is the wip plot
The Duchy of Thaeron under the late duke Xavier Graves was known as the heart of the Etrudian Kingdom. Centered along the violent waters of the Divide, the capital city of Daggercourt commanded the Silvermoon Harbor, first and largest of the suitable ports along the river. To its north, the Silverpine forest provides fine lumber to build the sturdy ships able to sail the Divide; and to the west, the Emerald Vale provides a bounty of food and ore to feed the city. Within the capital the thrum of industry transforms beats the raw materials into all manner of goods that are then shipped down the Divide. Thaeron, and especially Daggercourt, grew wealthy and powerful from these shipments.In the good times of old, the city ran with practiced efficiency. Xavier Graves tolerated no corruption under his rule and the dockmasters saw the construction of over a dozen ships every week, for none can ever make the return journey up the Divide. The noble houses were kept in check through heavy taxation and strict oversight while the commoners were appeased with government services and the opportunity to raise themselves up. Now, the marble city dangles on the edge of collapse. Killed in the night by a nail, the throne of Thaeron passed to the young Maxwell Graves. A boy of thirteen, Maxwell thinks only of vengeance and bows to the whim of his High Council in all other matters. Greed and corruption have clogged the gears of trade as more and more coin flows into the hands of noble houses. In the night, when mists from the boiling river blanket the city, a shadow war rages between houses. Though the vying for each other’s territory and wealth is nothing new between noble houses, a new development has surfaced. Through a dangerous and painful process, the Swellbinders channel the raw power of the Divide into an individual to awaken the Rune hidden within them. Using their Runes, noblemen now live double lives between day and night. Son, I find myself caught in this struggle and I’ve seen shadows in the mists at night. I know that the nature of my Rune has been leaked and they will soon come for me. You are the last hope of this house and I hope that you will come home soon to assume my position. I regret that our finances are in ruin and our artisans moved to House Lonato but I have left you our estate and the names of our old suppliers and allies. Return home, son, restore our house. But be careful who you trust with the secret of your house for there are those who will use you for your rune. 
I thought you saw the rune stuff
Did Milo show you the stuff for my continuation of gestalt

Then in like a month after all 15 will be there
Yea. Hopefully Monday's build is more finalized of those scenes
I feel like it could be more descriptive
You don't think it's too short
:////
And cut down on my script
And somehow broke the nice backgrounds
Yea Idk. I sent her a bear but she put hers in instead
Hopefully by Monday the scenes will be fixed to use our good backgrounds and have meters
And without health and hope meters yet
It's 2 of 15 planned scenes
Yea when it freezes that's all there is
Or I guess game proto type
Yo what did you think of the game
My internet restarted
Just arrived
Annie said come by 345
Incredible
My internet restarted
Oh ok. I don't mind if he mails the staff/gold

Also wow it sold
Monday night
Getting on

I'm on the way. Wait outside in lije 10
Actually 4. But I think we may end up cutting
But you always have a spot too if you want
Idk where you are on continuing campaign but we found 3 new potential players. All 18-22 guys who are into the game and probably decent rpers
Knock knock open up the door
Instead of kai and izoldi 
The part I like is world building. The problem is we just reset and so there's no villain again
I mean I always wanted more rp and plans. Somehow combat just drags longer than I plan
Yea ik. Not much to do as early casters
That's a pretty notable line then
The one who summoned the storm that destroyed falconguard
Kai. Hansas sikhar 
Oh. Anything to do with Kais highstorm
Well you didn't have backstory on lysandre so have it on the new guy
Just don't use an anime picture this time lol
The only obvious would be they know elvish 
Lol. The appearance would be almost human. Like the ears wouldn't be pointed like the normal half elves. Almost full round and the features would just be noble, not inhuman
No elves. You can use the half elf stuff but it's more like 1/1000 elf blood remaining
Could be
Sorcerers are cool. Remember the thing in alkathar about low born mages tho. Not too obvious with it
Yea. I think they're human now tho except Parsa
Healer is obv
By arcanist I mean dispel and counterspell stuff. And identify
No arcanist rn. No healer too
Yea. I guess there was a lot of meta gaming tho. Like in character they wouldn't know it wasn't a god or smth
Oh he wasn't anti party. He was actually offering significant power
Well I think we're playing tomorrow. So what's the new character 
Like nobody from session one lives to know of the eladrin twins or izoldi 
Alright. I'm up for that. The one thing is that a lot of plot is being dropped but I would rather have the princes call than a trial
I guess. But I need a reason for people to be going to falconrest
Since he's officially demoted until the hearing anyway. You can say that humbled him
Like toning him down a bit
Yea I thought you guys talked about that
L m a o
Like in the county. Getting off the plane
I'm back
Wtf. Why play with the inters and what expansion is that for
and youre pantheon then yea you can ff
but its 5-10 at 8 min vs kass aphelios yuumi whatever
i.e. its 20-20 at 30 minutes even towers and drakes then no ff
say at 40% chance then you can ff
you could use that to just tie in when the surrender is allowed
real talk they have the data available to train a predictor that calculates the likelihood of winning
can't wait to see how they fuck up another good idea
actually good use of ML from riot
good use of your 10 messages

instead of just being not the problem and blasting the looters back to the ghetto
but the cops waste resources on the protesters cause the chief is actually brain damaged
xd. actually its kinda just the looters and the cops that are the problem
did you guys sign the change petition to have the police chief bitch fired
fuck the protesters but extra fuck the looters
yea thats what i like to hear
anyone tryna get back on the mc grind
hivemind pretty sick
yea i had to sit next to her dumb ass a whole year
knew this bitch was dumb ever since econ but ig the world knows now too
anyway sign the thing so we can get someone with the balls to actually protect the city
and lockdown the city so we dont have to curfew for a week
send them back downtown
nah i just think she shouldve had them gassed or smth
imagine caring about ~1000 bucks worth of chain store shit omegalul
imagine using cops to look at protesters and not do their job
TLDR: dumb bitch cop too afraid to shoot looters - fire her skank ass<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1591135986900" ts="1591135986" t="61"></e_m>

its the implication but not the standard

Moved all my shit home 
Me back in fifteen
trump doing nothing is like the shittiest case
either lets let the world fully collapse and ride the storm for fun or roll some tanks down main street and force people into their houses
but thats still doing smthh right
italy is fully shut down which is hilarious because fuck the EU
asia did free testing and government takeover of core services as well as providing key supplies
and there really will be riots
if they do nothing than in a few months all the healthcare will be overrun
exactly. you prevent the storm by authoritative and quick government intervention
its what we need if we want to prevent everyone from catching it
also forcing the hospitals and doctors to work free
and forcibly took over stadiums and other large centers to build hospitals within a week
china just used drones and shit to tell people to stay inside
its not even martial law tho
xd
country goes to shit just move out
and save some lives
thats fine imo. teach them the price of rebellion
then another million a week
than let the virus spread bc we're looking at 1 million cases in 19 weeks
im saying its better we flatten some dumbass hippie protesters and enforce a quarantine
really
you think the government cant suppress the populace
with the cocksucker rebels
make some human pie like tiananmen square
tanks
even if they did the government has you knkow
and one retard in michigan got 50 ppl sick
while the US is relying on an honor system
and theyre already recovering OK for being patient 0
they quarantined 19 million over 550 cases
we need a stronger central govt so we can do what china did
A few months of isolation is lit 
Yea that's like 2-3 people you're close to dying
Sounds clean
Hang out inside and league or end all day
Death 
Martial law is better than Darth
Also I just don't wanna die. I want to see Europe die 
Yea. We have no more physical class too 
Let's go for black plague records you feel
I hope the EU collapses into anarchy and shit. Sounds dank 
Usc shut down until April 15 lmao
who saw that coming huh
yang endorses biden
then we come in and make a company that uses this data to generate ads for exactly what you need
xd
like you're thirsty so you put a coke ad on their email
ooh or little trackers in your blood that monitor your exact body composition and health shit so you know exactly what you need
bionanotech like wound repair bots and shit

who desire the end of china
he is but one of many
scum tactic
but he simplified it
i was gonna say Remove China Flu is free
honor him
yea ik. im just selfish as fuck so i havent changed
i like economic conservatism and social liberalism to some degree
then again i do too so maybe we're just boomers
christina still loves hillary
bruh its not even boomer women only
then again the easiest way to presidency is as biden or bernie's vp and wait for their boomer ass to die in office
or some favor for next election
probably angling for a paycheck
idk if she wants VP
bet
but shes gonna endorse biden
her bleeding heart followers already moved to sanders
ngl
expected her to back biden
d
milo just hates women x
thus continues the unbroken streak of men as presidents
voting omegalul
cause theyll have to handle the fallout
coronavirus is gonna fuck up and mar the term of whoever's next anyway
ay lets be real
even if i agree with him on  most shit this boomer faggot hates gamers
pepehands
biden is just such a tragedy tho. likes guns, likes death penalty, hates weed and minorities, just happens to hate gamers
i literally dont know any of her positions bc shes irrelevant
unironically
ngl the only fucker i hate more than bernie is biden
mars i think scraping people's public posts is already fully legal
to spread whatever they want
and sell that data to other people
we simplify the process of creating a 'viral' whatever
the point is to learn which people are easily influenced and use them to convince their network
mars youre misunderstanding this. its subliminal on the weakest links in a social network
get rich quick
im thinking we just repurpose that a little
theres someone at my lab whos doing profile-building AI to detect which avenues a specific person is most influenced by
ez money tho
and like with extra-high importance targets, like the close friends of presidents or smth you can install gait-recognition AI to city cameras to mark them wherever they go to get even more data than what's on social media<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1583189676585" ts="1583189676" t="61"></e_m>
and like with extra-high importance targets, like the close friends of presidents or smth you can install gait-recognition AI to city cameras to mark them wherever they go to get even more data than what's on social media<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1583189676585" ts="1583189676" t="61"></e_m>
ooh we can make people pay to opt out. theres a lot of potential here
whos with it
but i think an easier company is just building the AI to create the network from scraped social data. then we sell it to media companies and make bank
then we have him because its not propaganda, its coming from his close network
then we find which of them is easily influenced and which we need to go another layer deeper on until we have say 20% of his network swayed
example: if jett is a high influence leader but he's hard to sway with subliminal propaganda then we find his network = smth like milo, me, his mom, etc
if anyone wants to turn this into an actual company and business we'll be fucking rich as hell
and use this to spread ideas &quot;organically&quot; by planting it in the key targets
so basically what i'm saying is that you can eventually build a network of ALL humans and then track key targets both easy to influence and likely to influence others
idk how i thought of this but hear me out
the average max size of hunter-gatherer groups is 50 because that's the optimal # of people in terms of group dynamics, past that you don't know every person in the group thoroughly. from this we can extrapolate that every person has ~50 people they are most influenced by, right. In the best overlap case, there are 1225 (50*49/2) possible 2-way relationships to track pertaining to this clique. average case is probably larger but not large enough to be beyond computation. ANYWAY, its hypothetically possible with modern tech to build a neural network that scans someone's social media accounts to build their network of 50 and all cross connections, then use this to extrapolate the people they are most influenced by and how influenceable they are. Also, learning the connections of those will eventually give you a large set of easily influenced people with high degrees of influence on important targets
literally woman
LMAO Jetts a bitchh
gay pete is dead
lmao damn. he's coming for the gamers
75 minute power nap. pce
deadass
thats my plan 
go take a nap you simp
league
Half the votes minus the simps
sick of working with indians and mainlanders
will vote a fucking potato in if thats what it takes
you know what i really want. a candidate that will stop handing out h1b visas like halloween candy
truly we are the most oppressed
can always move countries. speak enough languages and have an in demand skill set
i guess. whoever wins will win tho and nothing will really change
and his hatred for gamers
also because the only candidate who has even a chance of making my life worse is joe
effort is pain
im with parsa. voting is effort
im always up to help a boomer cross the rift
least favorite kindergarten lesson
also parsa youre a nerd
where youre totally rested yet you slept too long to ever truly wake
9 hours is the sweet spot
he didnt get his baby nap
Pog
the order you listed them is tilting me
milo can you get pregnant
anyone else see jett's skype account without the status bubble 
this man pale as shit and cant birth
also why the fuck does annie+fizz+rumble = garen
star guardian comp every game. tft only
thats clean
also changes how long your startup from sleepy to working is
personally i only need 6-7 if i fall asleep midnight but i need 8+ if i sleep 2am
depends. some people need more to function and some need less
at your advanced age you should just follow health guidelines and eat your minimum calories, drink the suggested amount of water, and sleep 8+ hours
most gamers dont<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1582749804656" ts="1582749804" t="61"></e_m>

alright. youre undereating
Signs of undereating include:
Low energy levels and constantly feeling tired or exhausted
Regularly constipated
Constantly hungry
Moody and irritated easily
Poor mental concentration
Dizziness
Loss of period or normal menstrual function
Inability to get pregnant
Constantly thirsty
Constantly feeling cold
Hair loss and brittle nails
Pale complexion
also this
headaches and lack of energy and shit come before the fainting
well this is like really severe dehydration
does this sound like you
igns of severe dehydration include:

Not peeing or having very dark yellow pee
Very dry skin
Feeling dizzy
Rapid heartbeat
Rapid breathing
Sunken eyes
Sleepiness, lack of energy, confusion or irritability
Fainting
and stir in honey
if its irritating you can just microwave it to warm
maybe drink warmer water
how does it give you a stomach ache lmao
its literally 0 calories 0 flavor 0 nutrients except the water
water is the least reactive shit ever
or 8 glasses
its like 2 liters a day
if youre thirsty youre really dehydrated
i mean you can also just see if youre thirsty
youre dehydrated
slight yellow is ok
if its not clear
passing out sounds like dehydration
or dehydrated
maybe  youre just underfed
but thats worth it for energy now
youll die at 50
ez
50% meat, 25% fruit, 25% carbs and vegs
would recommend
also i eat a bunch of fruit
at this age you can just balance meat/carbs and some vegetables and be fine
its healthy when youre old and decrepit
granola is boomer food
christina cooks lol
lmao
your diet fucking sucks you go out for burritos like every day
i wake up 10am 6 hours of sleep and im zooming
we're zoomers tho
if theres gamer hours
damn i think my blood is turning toxic
bc that happened to me and i sat there for like 5 minutes with a needle in my arm before needing to be hit with smelling salts to wake up
when they drew your blood did it slowly crawl out like thick sludge
yikes
gonna be the first time in years SM cops have shit to do
and when i drove by him he yelled &quot;Why does everyone drive by. Why do you think im crazy&quot;
theres some crazy black dude on my street waving his phone and yelling at cars to stop
same
huge brain play by putin. just support both sides and you can never lose
Apply as a first year
also grads should have a job/internship paying them right
continuous cost vs one-time cost
Shit dude me too 
What's it over
Ofc 
The usual suspects
I'm assuming fucking hippies or sjws
Wtf is happening there 
Lul
Big F
just come here
ay usc made tuition free if you make under 80k a year and doesnt count home equity towards financial need now
meta  slave
Can't tea time to max charisma irl
Fe girls are better than real ones
but most importantly he bolshevicc
sonic thicc
why you calling me out
Fair enough 
.6% odds everything is fucked
xd
this is why we need the death penalty
just do whatever i get paid to right
hell yea
i should go into law
but if we give them a bigger res slightly north and fully in texas we can close that border and take in exactly the refugees we can afford
bc theres also a bit of our border which is still native territory which means we cant patrol it or build the wall there
this is a huge brain idea
and the majority of people coming in would fit in. obv not all cause some are mix spanish-indigenous but a significant are full native
thats a lot of free space
wait actually why dont we just shove refugees onto reserves
this is america
clearly we have shown we don't want them here
most south american refugees are indigenous
or finish them off
YouTube really knows what I wanna see huh 
average korean is hot as fuck

you ever realize how destiny metas as hard as pars
cant focus on any one stream
true. i just listen while reading smth else
well thats an interesting point to tune in
oh hes giving natives diseases
xd
destiny dnd stream
feel
and so id rather it stay the same
realistically life is great right now
more seriously thats just too idealistic
duh
i want to see change not experience it
the other is an easy to produce drug to remove sexual inclination
or CRISPR on embryos
well asexual reproduction is half the equation
and a bunch of other laws like no implanting of even fertile and viable eggs
because you HAVE to kill your eggs after some time
although the dumbass government makes it hard
as they already are with single-woman fertilization 
sure but we can work towards it
that should be our goal
including the death of the sun
theres some theorem out there for the minimum number of inhabited planets for humans to survive any calamity
and ensure that its progeny will do the same
life at a basic level exists only to propagate itself
the better
the simpler the process and the more consistent the outcome
the purpose of life is reproduction
It truly is the most op class
Ideally everyone is an asexual with asexual reproductive capabilities
Eugenics ez
If we build them up they'll take our spot
So by weakening others we ensure we survive the crash
True
So harmony is achieved
Of identical people
Until we have a mono humanity
I think we need to drastically reduce world population
The existence of others threatens you
This world can only sustain so many people and so I'd rather see those not like me disappear than those like me
This universe is finite. Its resources finite
If you aren't with us you're against us
They're the enemy
Because they're competition
Or simply are
That's you I guess. I dislike those who choose to be different
Them being not-you isn't enough?
For me it's all people I don't personally know or relate to
Happiness on the suffering of those you dislike
Is the term
Schaedenfraued or smth
But personally I'm happier when I have more than others and those I care about are doing better than those I don't
I mean it's personal philosophy. I don't think I can convince you
&quot;Happiest are those whose walls already rise&quot; - some bitch in civ5 
That's the place to be. Within the walls while others are not 
And therefore happy
The real reason is because you're insulated from others who are suffering
So the happier others are the less you are overall
Obviously when you have more
Or when you have more
Why not. Are you just as happy when your neighbor has as much as you
That is mathematically tractable btw
Therefore decreasing Y is optimal 
EU is a nation of cows banded together to form a tiger
I'm very happy now so increasing X is more difficult
You can optimize delta by either increasing X or decreasing Y
Quick math
So we should aim to maximize our happiness differential by maximizing suffering in others
In comparison
The way I see it tho war breeds suffering. The more suffering in the world the better my life is
Netting better trade and shit
It isn't all in hard numbers. A lot is soft power 
The numbers are what matter. If we spend X on the military as long as force is netting us at least X+1 it's good
God?
But who can stop you
Ok but if they want idk 1 billion for their goods but you could spend 10000 soldiers to take it why not take it
or utilize it
should we ignore that
we could fix our problems with the resources of other countries
ekeing the most meager of existence's off the land
living worthless lives
if it didnt we'd still be native tribes
might makes right gwyn
south america didnt play well and got fucked for it
the ME is also similar
learn to play around that better
if you are the cow, stay under the radar
you cant blame the tiger for killing the cow
be more useful or be manipulated
so then they get whats coming to them
so its still on them
yea but they were too weak to stop us
non-tier 1 city china
southeast asia
africa
like those middle eastern religious states
an inclusive OR between the two
uncivilized - poor, with backwards culture
or who are already educated
we should only be letting in those coming for education
immigration from uncivilized countries is a mistake
china has &lt;100 naturalized citizens
who are too impatient to wait for the proper channels
the law should be applied to illegal immigrants
eye for an eye
i can kill your sister but it isnt your place to kill me
is no excuse
ignorance of the law or a good reason to commit a crime
no, objectivity matters
im ok with my tax spent on that
i like it
the law is blind to intent
crime
its criminal to commit a cime
which did happen but like they only got 10% at best
i just like the idea of putting border jumping criminals in cages
which he failed almost wholly
2 - border control
although half the shit he does is unintentional
1 - stand up to china
he has like 2 good policies
a fucking carpet could beat trump
i mean the bet is basically he doesnt win primary
they are tho
ok ill deadass bet any amount he doesnt get elected president
to the point its wack
except turned up to 100
this is how we eliminate diversity
anyway read that linked comment
fat people are disgusting
implement china's breeding programs
i found this
lmao wait
even the successful ones cant compete
had 4 of them when i started CS, all 4 dropped within the first year
theyre all degenerates
anyway you get my point

cant play against a champ you dont want to look at
every time i see that champ i want to die
lucian has hired gun and project
instead of ratchet trash
give her a skin where she looks passable
they did already
utopia is eliminating differences
without people who WANT aphelios/senna/etc
wouldnt league be better without people like that
see those people are the problem

no
if beauty is art then it too has no place
art is the absence of function
if diversity breeds resistance then it has no use
path of least resistance
e.g. electricity
the fundamentals of this universe dictate that
there is always a single optimized path
and imperfection
which lead to errors
diversity breeds differences
eusocial is the best kind of social
the perfect humanity is one where every human is the same
well it wont be once we eliminate the biological need for such useless things
we must cull differences
perfection through assimilation 
1 gender, 1 race, 1 sexuality
i see a future where there is only 1 gender
also did you hear how they fertilized an egg with the woman's own sperm generated through her cells in some way
whyd you buy urfwick
same
4head
just be better
so let them win
dumbass poor people keep voting against their interest
also idk why youd want to help people who wont help themselves
we should send the poor people to the center and then secede
only 10 states pay for the nation
honestly i just want california to be independent so we stop supporting the shithole states
xd
or youre gay
so either you help others because the govt forces you
nothings changed
i mean...yea
and need order
yea but some of these poverty ass redneck kids have too much freedom
no reason to waste capable people's time with it
imo it gives loser kids purpose but if youre going to college or have a job you should be exempt
lmao theres already some high schools where your graduation req is sa job offer, a college admission, or joining the military
my dude too fucking bitchmade to run or win
but hes def a bottom
idk his actual policies
true
xd
unviable has a double meaning
did you know pete is gay
?
gamer hours
riot liked it so much that they gave me a key fragment for being so honorable
you guys remember how i told someone in league &quot;i hope a family member of yours commits suicide&quot; 
as is tradition with nintendo IP
Yea 
SCP 42069 - Chad
is he the one who let us into davids building
also men who were pissing him off
thats the real power play
LBJ used to whip his dick out on women
talking is distracting typing is ok
cant
im studying for the amazon final round
its just how it is
see the problem is dating white women
i was so much happier
then when i just accepted it
i spent my whole teenage times trying to be different and thinking how to not conform
thats where you find fulfillment and content
learning to conform is the most important lesson in life
trying to be different and unique is the source of discontent
or just...conform and be happy
again why dont you want to just take the easy route to a fulfilling and comfortable life
its satisfying, its easy, its profitable
yea but why dont you want to do one of the big 3
self driving AI, workload automation, etc
like connecting africa via internet or sending rockets into space
if youre after personal satisfaction a lot of tech companies are out there doing good things for people
this is a good life to get into
and their campus is way cooler than anything youll find outside tech
for even junior devs
unlimited paid time off
google literally has massages on demand
plus you work in cool offices with cool people
you put in half-time work to get an education for like 5x the pay
total
its like 20 hours a week
and dnd shit
look how much league i play with you guys
its not that hard
easy bank
or go into medicine/law
milo youre smart do stem
kinda dog
which yea
90k is like 44/hr
total comp
~90k
both are kinda shit pay actually
they do mostly sensor systems
like the curiosity on mars
another is for exploration rovers
one is for rocket system automation
ive got interviews with like 2 rocket companies doing some really cool shit. that field is sick
anything really
aerospace
industrial
biomedical engineering
and seeing yourself succeed 
it feels good chasing a goal
pursue something greater milo
xd
i dont like this
when did i become not the edgiest one
ok well youre lonely. SAD
or seen someone in class or whatever and wanted to ask them out
what youve never fucked a girl you want to go back out with
yea
why not
fuck you 2 then
im gonna cop an idea
for v day
you guys doing anything
and i aint a housewife
thats a bitch move cause then youre cooking alone
so i need ideas of places to check
but everything is full
yes
yea. theyre also full
im the one who got played
nah they've taken us to similar places
rn
im fucked
YEA I DID
or i got powerplayed on
so i gotta match that
her mom took us for like 1500$ steak
i was thinking more expensive than that
and theyre all full
melisse only has 8 tables after the renovation
btw anyone have valentines day ideas
so you dont want a prenup
marry a girl richer than you
imagine having to put effort into your sex life omegalul
its more hassle than just getting her to suck your dick or ride you when you feel like it
and you have to install like a foot placer thing
you cant fuck in the shower anyway youll slip and die
mine is hot-&gt;smart-&gt;rich-&gt;shorter than you-&gt;not loud
whats your ordering
the checklist in order of most to least important
lmao
just green card marriage a bitch
yea but like you got options too milo
and what kinds of children are acceptable
when it comes to who should date who
shes more conservative than me by a lot
i havent said anything shed be against tho
lmao she might read this
or pushy
and not too loud
obviously hot
smart
rich
perfect girl is like close to your height but shorter
just talking about like straight relationships
idk how shit works for non-straight people and im not looking to
doesnt matter if theyre short
yea exactly so fuck whoever
otherwise she looks like shes dominant
why would you not want to be taller than your girl
idk i dont wanna get disowned so i dont bother with non asian/white
doesnt mean it didnt suck tho
ig
still traumatized
worst gf ever was faith
like 2 and it SUCKED
unlike fuckin shannen or smth idk
and i never worried about them talking shit about me or accusing me of shit
never needed to with valerie or rachel or whatever
and all that shit
and like pretend to care about their opinions about politics
i had to do shit they wanted
nah but like remember when i went out with white girls in highscool
they just do what you want and your life is easy
its not in the culture
thats what we're avoiding here by saying go for ethnic girls
mars german girls have this idea of like feminism and metoo xd
because asian girls are the best. dating white women was a mistake
also she like listens to him too
im assuming she has options tho
and supportive
and is super chill with him about it
dating a guy working uniqlo
shes a ucla biology graduate
look at diego and his girl
so therefore reasonable
yea bitch go date some asian chick. theyre usually smart and obedient
straight up its like the 1920s
so its safe
feminism isnt a thing in asia yet
just date an asian girl
i want humanity to continue with the best people possible
because its progress
because otherwise the world is populated with the shit genes of indian or african povery ass bitches
i see it as a disservice to humanity not passing on your genes
ig 
its someone elses genes
or like theyll be adopted at which point it isnt your kids anyway
they wont have kids then
thats all it needs to be
just have 2 normal kids. 1 son, 1 daughter. intelligent, attractive, straight, black hair and eyes
tbh tho by the time we want kids the tech will be out to select their genes
thats how humanity improves
thats how progress grows at an exponential rate
that can contribute more than you ever did
your genes have so much potential and are so far above average youre doing a disservice to humanity by not providing 2 normal kids
yea but would you want a kid that isnt normal
cant keep it
you konw
im not my parents so i wouldnt drop them in a ditch but
itd be bad
and start over again
no having an autistic kid would be a disaster. its a year of pregnancy wasted and now you have to give them up
both completely normal and intelligent
mars my family is going to have 2 kids
im pretty sure my parents wouldve ditched me in a dumpster at the first sign of problems
when you can have another and train them
idk why youd support an autistic child
but if you didnt then work for it
some people luck into it
because everyone can work hard enough to get here
yes. so im gonna make sure my kid works hard enough they dont need to be
and i got lucky i ended up here
i wasted so much fucking time after school playing league and shit
to expose even more potential
i know exactly how to push a kid like me
id be a great father
those with potential
you need to be realistic and support those who deserve it
idk. if he kept with them our family would have nothing
1 child failing is just unlucky
failing as a parent is having no children succeed
i have no qualms cutting off 1 son
gwyn my grandpa cut off like 12 of his siblings because they amounted to nothing
im not leaving this world with my heir an incompetent
id just have another
not my son
yes
because theyre failures
if they fail to do so they dont deserve anything
they exist to build a better one for their kids
if they fail they dont deserve a better world
because they know they can afford to
id rather them fail than have no ambition and never seek anything
id rather teach my children to be strong than build them a net
you have the pride and satisfaction and your children have a nicer world
thats what counts
this progress amounts to better lives for your children
refusing to work toward it is selfish
your time on this world is cosmic nothing. your only meaning is to be part of greater progress
instead of working towards long term progress
cause people here want to be lazy and enjoy their time
again why do you think every other country is progressing faster than us
thats lazy shit
and be the fucking best at their specialty 
thats part of the fun tho
everyone should grind to know the most they can
only shitty coworkers or low level managers
of everyone ive met nobody has had a bad boss
except shitty little local ones
thats like all companies tho
so now he just manages shit because they can trust him to understand all the technical details and problems
to l7
and so they promoted him
anyway hes just a fucking genius
half cousin
i mean ones my cousin and he's always been chill
and knowing the full tech stack
nah you get there by being really fucking good at what you do
your general managers and executives are pretty cool people
i genuinely dont. the worst people to deal with are team managers and low level production people
i dont see how being successful means youre high strung
because failure is an option
safety nets make us weaker overall
and those who fail end up on the pile of bodies to be climbed over
personally id rather live in a world where everyone is gunning for the top
same with like google execs and shit
like all the professors with decades of tenure and research dont give a fuck cause they know theyre untouchable
have you worked with people who are genuinely top of their field. theyre kinda laid back
damn TIL
arent at the top
yes mars C level execs
drink a lot of wine and work just enough
and theyre all pretty chill
ik a lot of people at like c level tech or other business
idk i dont think most peoples egos are that large
self improvement and results
thats literally the fun part
why would you pursue a life thats not at the top
or with the potential to be
nerfing the people at the top only makes sense if you dont think of yourself at someone at the top
so everyones on an equal floor regardless of capability
while we're at it
lets buff annie until shes top tier
good idea
yea nerf the people for playing well
and you should learn a useful skill
if you dont have the capacity to be needed by those at the top then youre a bitch at the bottom of the totem pole
which is the real ideal
but thats just companies and unchecked capitalism
the problem is obviously rat fuckers who group up to cover their own weakness
theres a certain appeal to the idea of living or dying on your own personal capability
otherwise that time was a waste
i got suckered into scouts for 5 years so i want to be forced to need basic survival skills
im ready for the anarchy
im capable and smart as fuck so ill be fine
no govt no tax bb
duh
bc w/ no government companies can pay me that much more
come with me and just stay there
ay im going to new zealand for spring break
mars i cant tell wtf you want
this is just shooting yourself in the foot
youre also studying data science which is the industry thats gonna get fucked by bernie
and youre employed
you live in a nice place
just measure how your life is going
unless youre bill gates you can always look at your neighbor and be like &quot;hes rich, im poor&quot;
you always think youre poor no matter where you are

social liberal economic conservative<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1580866268009" ts="1580866268" t="61"></e_m>
yea but she had good policies
cause they all suckk
except the fact she was kind of a bitch
i like hilary's policy
im registered for nobody
you get money for college already
you think bernies gonna give you money
whats wrong with life rn
why risk it
itll be decades before youre affected
and life is good
rn the course is good
why do you want to risk your life changing for the worse
everyone else keeps life nice and good
fuck him i dont want change
except bernie
who cares who wins
look what i found
Xd 
So bless trump boys 
That's good policy
Like Christina's internship place is pretty much brand new and already worth billions. Like just their staffing cost is 2 billion a year. Which is like 15k good jobs
By not taxing shit he enables these companies to expand a bunch
which is doing smth
he changed the course tech wouldve taken
inaction is a form of action
him being too incompetent to make change has been doing good
like obama or hillary would have
not going after big tech
nah trump has done a lot
so ig hes just the best leader
weirdly enough the trump years have been the best of my life tho
im not the most affected by politics but ik during obama things got better
id take some dead terrorists for that if he didnt hate gamers
still riding the high off that one
good economy tho
like whos running to just keep life the same as it is
whos even neutral this election
people would just think change occurred
yea. i dont think anything would really change
ig
for the people actually affected by politics
so he'd be worse than trump
see pence is legitimately smart
so theyd poison a candidate
people fear change and the future though
life isnt even that bad right now that people would risk that play
yea exactly
or some shit
cause they slipped him polonium
is bernies dumb old ass is gonna have a heart attack
the real play
hes a red herring sent to disrupt the democrats by the republicans clearly
sure. thats a fair point
they have way better methods to cheat in way more crucial moments
you dont get caught cheating and do the same move again
and its the same exact move
cause everyone sees it
but this isnt how theyre gonna cheat right
yea true
the simplest one is literally no budget to build an app
theres so many simple reasons for this
to be anything but regular incompetence
i feel like this is too shitty of an attempt
maybe
when the truth is like 5-15
instead of just saying &quot;i had 10k, he only had 9&quot;
why make it break
right but if you were going to make this app to count caucus members
if youre going to cheat why cheat so obviously
is the worst move
making it not work and look shady as fuck
to display to everyone his victory
if there was a conspiracy why wouldnt he rig the app
paid by the govt
but it is a private company
i thought it was private company
is Shadow govt
so just regular old fraud
or renegotiating
literally going and forging contracts
what do you mean rewriting
this involves too many people to be conspiracy imo
NSA spying and shit
think of all the secret government plans leaked with far less people involved
rather than everyone who worked on it being paid off
yea but that just sounds like incompetence 
everyone else can see and pull it 
at any level if you push something broken
database code has to be written
development literally doesnt work like that. people have to test
their app was being built to fail
every employee of the company would know
that thousands involved all said nothing
is far more likely than corruption on a level so deep
government incompetence
the simplest answer is usually the right one
idk. occam's razor right
its just incompetent as fuck 
i mean to build that app they would need easily millions
i dont blame them
but if they were only paid that much
thats shady yea
with another 50k youre looking at the budget it takes to make the devs go to work one day
i mean it says the DNC paid about 63k
nah even if you were a real company 100k couldnt build shit
he spent just enough money to make a UI and push it to the store with some basic functions
thats like 100 dev hours. its 100% intentional it didnt work
no wonder it failed
wait they only had 100k to make an app
thats a power play right there
Why can't you fucks pick soraka top for me every game so I can ignore that lane 
Jg is ruined. Top lane matters in soloq but not in pro
Isn't he twitch banned
But who jgs cait 
Damn. I figured it's an adc
I assume he's playing vayne or graves
but you should do it
you wont get the money back
do it
i think theyre just stupid
The men have no excuse
but at least thats ok
theres a girl who comes sometimes
making me actually work
struggling with basic programming
its consistently the same retards week after week
the wrong half ig
ruining my paid time off
why tf are these people here
i never went for help
the zoomers are doomed 
i swear when i learned it this wasnt that hard
oh god
hes back
thats not my job
like fuck your dumb foreign ass learn to read english
and ive gotten 5 people asking me how &amp; and * work or &quot;what do these instructions mean&quot;
the thing that tilts me is this shit is all freshman level
its really easy. every char is 1 byte. if i want to read the Nth letter of string all i do is read(string+N)
ok so if you have a string which is just a collection of characters and youre reading through 1 by 1 in a separate thing he's asking how do we tell it to read the next char instead of the string head
300 level course btw
&quot;how do i track the character I last read in a string when I call read so I can read the next one&quot;
fucking kms
theres this dumbass stoned looking kid who keeps asking me to clarify the lab instructions
and that restored my mental
im stuck in lab answering dumbass algorithm questions
tru
you wanna be back?
i didnt put you back?
listen to this fire
a bunch of roided up chads rampaging through a country is how you make sure they lost
the goal is never just to win, its to make sure they lose
if they int they int
thats fine. the goal is maximum carnage anyway
After an invasion they'll have a generation of half American bastards 
See that's what I'm saying. We need to not do that shit. Give them Viagra every meal so they're total chad and literally fuck the shit out of any bitches we invade
getting fucked is bad. doing the fucking is good. we just need to have chad training for the military
is your problem with him that he's swedish or that hes a fuck
because thats what warfare was according to blizz
you cant say that just cause theyre both brown
how tho
is he vegan
its unfortunately their right to be a bitch boy
the thing about full simulated virtual reality is that its private property. its like being in someone's house right. they can say youre not allowed to drop n bombs or youre asked to leave without violating any rights
kkona
obviously
i have the right to call people racial slurs
YES
theyre nothing but animals
dismantled their academic institutions and lost their own culture
they abandoned their emperor and turned against the dynasty as it was fighting japan. literally backstabbed their ruler
those people deserve their shitty government and the things it does to them
that fuck themselves
its entirely the people of china
taiwan has more chinese culture than china and they managed to build up a first world country with a functioning government, prosperity, and decent quality of life
all aspects of chinese culture right now are what the government instilled after the revolution. its what the people built themselves
the ccp dismantled confucious, ancestor worship, buddhism, literacy, etc
you understand there is no chinese culture any more
its entirely on them
the people chose to give up their rights in exchange for security and foo
and capable
i dont care for their government at all but theyre intelligent
you just keep them in line
youd never help them
the people in china are the fucking worst 
if you look at china's history its always peasant uprisings that bring down the government so if youre a smart leader you just have to keep them happy
they can subjugate the population and stay in power
their play is just to gather enough power and money in the government that when things fall apart
their gdp is a bubble on empty houses
thats literally what they did
and they can report a growth of gdp
but the people are placated for a while
and the money ends up back in the govts hands anyway
and so they used money to build these cities 
there were too many people out of work right
they used ghost cities to make jobs milo
they built them knowing theyd be empty
and drawing foreign investment
the ghost cities stimulate their economy by moving money out of the government
it hasnt escaped or really fucked any other populace
the deaths of a bunch of chinese peasant farmers is a good thing though
theyre making big plays here
actually it has the added benefit of potentially weakening other countries too
now they have a cheap solution
idk i think its a good choice. the ghost cities generate money while the people dont
not like they dont deserve it either so its karma
its a practical plan though. the world wont let you kill them so you just allow disease to
you call it inability. i see it as refusal
thats why they arent dealing with it
lets be real they wanted the plague to deal with the peasant infestation
ngl
league stone looks pretty good
i always knew we were overdue for a plague
chinese new year incoming this weekend too
fuck is dicksword
the auth right loves crocs tho cause thats what they aspire to do
least favorite animals
are you tilted yet
jett put champions in there so i can draw titties
what happened to kobe
fair that game is overpriced
overcooked
or if you really wanna goon
scribblio
so youre saying he does think people should be in jail for color
d
x
those are the real key issues
hes not a gamer tho
fuck this man. rather have trump
joe biden hates GAMERS
or can you play it now
is it still in beta
xd
escape from tarkov?
rate out of 10
or smth more scuffed like overcooked and duck game
anyone league or scribblio
cause cig smokers are gonna die soon so theyre preparing you
good game
yes
risk of rain
<at id="8:mars.speaks">Ride</at> <at id="8:live:jettamoore_1">Jett</at> <at id="8:parsa.jourx">Parsa</at> risk of rain?
ill hit you up later
for now
scuffed
cant invite cause riot servers
chats broken anyway
hows he still on break
by playing league
anyone want to make me more of a doomer
milo you fall asleep so fast cause you operate at 10% by the time you sleep
holding smth definitely speeds it up
i slept worse before christina basically mmoved in
unlucky you
ah ok. i get straight hours
like imagining whats happening on a chess board or hearthstone game
weirdly card games are really good cause i can burn out my energy tracking the game on sounds alone
closer to 2 hours without
ike a youtube video
i think i average closer to 30 min if i listen to smth in the background
anyway. jett how long do you take to sleep
will it fit the spaghet
or are they normal size
did they shrink
why sleep if no tire
really milo is just 50/50 up or down
or slightly sick milo
or tired milo
not like milo on pizza
i function pretty much the same all day
comp-bed is usually longer
depending on what im thinking about as im falling asleep
but it takes like anywhere between 30-3 hours to sleep
im like comp-watch videos and cuddle-fuck-bed
i use flux so the light isnt bad
rn
im like 2 hours to sleep
most of you are white so you should have less shit to worry about
life is chill and good. shits easy so take it easy
be chill
lifes chill
without drugs
fuck is wrong with your brain that you cant be happy and stressless
but if you cant handle your life sober your life sucks
its the boomer age catching up
the older i get the more sober i like to be
you bitches are just edgy
i like my life enough to like it sober
experience sharper
remember more
youre keener
sober is nice
my mind does
ye but you have to look at it
unless shes hot
you cant get into the frame of mind to nut
imo nah
if shes not technique doesnt matter
its easy
if shes hot and on your dick
find better girls ig
shits usually good
i hthink i get there 9/10
damn
you only came once
and usually theyre hot enough they dont have to know how
like 1/5 cant
but like. most girls can
who are you fucking that cant suck a dick
clever
good pun
giving is meh
getting head is fun
bad
nightmare
loser
gross
mars you eat out
again find a better girl if she smells damn
and thats what matters
girls smell good
idk
fuck classier girls
..
ideal ratio is like 20:1. just an every now and then thing
and waiting for you
and thats a lot of prep for her
if you do anal you have to deal with the shit
why bother with anything else
its special made for dick
pussy is just tight
idk i never fucked any girl whos ass was significantly tighter
and you have so much more to deal with
in a significant way
its really not tighter
self cleans
self lubes
listen pussy is less work
and even then its probably worse
the only time to do it in the ass is on her period
gross
thats a galaxy brain move
to lubricate with what used to be seminal fluid
but like what if you could rewire a post op vagina
and men can produce vaginal fluid naturally
cause they dont really go inside you and replace your internals right
or like seminal fluid
with cum
do post op vaginas self lubricate
than anything else imaginable
which is worse
theres people into actual shit
ig
people are into weird shit
right there on the sidewalk
would get off on it
where if they got jumped
ok so youre saying theres someone out there
as getting off on assault
yea but what im saying is theres no such kink
getting hit in the butt != getting gut punched
and getting of on someone straight jumping you
i feel like theres a difference between liking slapping
milo has waluigi energy
kinkshaming is fine
with his noodle arms
i think milo could legit jump you
do you actually enjoy getting beaten up tho
if you think aboutit
testosterone is just steroids
i really doubt it
pay per view bitch
paypal me 5$ for the livestream link
its gonna happen
milo will defeat gwyn
doesnt need to care about life
shes in the optimal demographic
which is weird
she actually cares about others
the shit we dont agree on is like how much people matter
how do i mute her
ok gwyn doesnt know what shes saying
what else could you want
i already dont call people niggers unironicaly
im just also usually irght
milo i listen to her
they are truly a mystery
who knows what women want
and she doesnt see it
her parents would take her in if she shot someone
we just argue about being chill or not
and theyd take her in
she could show up on crack
theyre parents. no matter what theyll love you and support you
idk how
while i just dont give a fuck. i need to teach her how to but
she cares a lot about how her parents think of her
yea thats the other thing
whats gonna happen really
ok but short of her getting addicted to fucking crack
and i try to convince her of it but idk. it isnt working
i just assume everything will work out
not finding a job, saving for retirement, classes, etc
and worries about life
which is why im amazed she gets so stressed about things
so were kinda even
but i spend less
ive got like 50 on me
like makeup and shit
shes only got like 10k in the bank cause she buys a lot of stuff
her parents earn more but her grandparents have nothing
on hand nah
define immediate
so much
but she stresses about shit
i keep trying to tell her life is easy and we're chilling
but her worldview is darker
in some ways
cause christina hates it
in 12 months
i actually dont think ive said it outside league and your dumbass scribblio
are

bitch youre older than me
therefore i hate other people
i like things staying as they are
and i hate change
and change my life plan
and my satisfaction
because everyone wants to take away my happiness
bleak
view of the world and people
my view of my life is bright
so long
it comes from being parsas friend
im just naturally edgy
why risk it
shits chill
life is great
you guys have bleak ass world views
im not suicidal at least
jesus fuck
does anyone NOT have mental health problems
first mars now gwyn
as soon as im out of class
no fuck you im gonna que
and south ameria
you mean africa
and made me a doomer 
you played league with me
you guys made me think that not all people are great
its you guys that changed my mind anyway
and a lot of his shit isnt peer reviewed
i have but that guy is a crackpot
or make way
instead, i think now only certain people are great and others should serve them
south asia wouldnt be so shit
greatness cant be in all people because otherwise africa and south america would have great people
after so much self debilitation
look at the history of the world. asia and europe constantly fought themselves and set themselves back time and time again. only to conquer the world
i think now that only certain people have potential
youve changed my mind
anyway ive gone back on that thought
mute retard
good != excellent
and i think excellence may even be more common in certain people
i dont think all people have excellence
all of southeast asia constantly self debilitating
if thats true why are there countries in africa with centuries of poverty and turmoil
its not even a hard game to complete. just one that has a lot of bonus objectives
thats how games are designed
if life is a single player you can always win
and got rich
there are poor people who invented something
or at least competent
choose to be excellent
and have the money to do so
then they should excel at their work
if your culture lets you turn away family then solve that first
thats a cultural issue
id count on familial support over country
i dont particularly like annie but ive supported her anyway
who turns away family
we'd gain nothin
friends and family already are your net
that covers such things
youre in position to have a job
and in return we pay higher tax
we gain nothing
at our loss
which makes no sense
it is because youre saying we should vote against ourselves
e.g. 1 american child vs a kenyan one
matter more than those who arent like you
people you know and are similar to
i hope you guys would do the same
if it meant you guys live
listen i'd genocide all of like kenya or smth
or friends
why make millions better if the thousands are your family
1 to 1
but if its numbers how are you valuing your children vs some strangers
your and your own vs the world
probably more accurate
single family game
you deserve it
if you lose to the AI
single player game
until the weak are strong enough to stop them
the strong should be able to do what they want
i get your point. i dont agree
I support healthcare obviously
Ok but we don't need them then. The sick can heal but the weak can't
Who can't
Unless you're a native held at gunpoint on your reservation you can direct your life 
Animals can't
Humans have the ability to act and change their circumstance
Than lowlifes
They're more valuable abd rare
To kill Milo
Jett you're gonna need form 115b
Without the right permit 
Also true. Slaughter of animals is illegal
Why not
Made their actions legal again 
Doing unethical shit like Amazon is ok because they paid their fine
But there's no moral Obligation to do so 
If the laws change to make the taxation ok then fine
Because it has to come at some cost. As of the laws now nothing done was illegal
Even if it's hard it's on the individual to grab it
And again the ability to rise still exists
More are rising from poverty than falling
It still exists tho. Millions are now middle class in China when their parents had nothing
The system is flawed
That's ok. But if they make it so there's no hope
If there's a possibility and you don't make it
But it is possible to rise. That's what I think is the key
Fucking phone
Their
Forcing the rich to give up they're money is no different
It sucks
So you see what I'm saying. When others force a choice on you
But it's not one I agree with and not one we should force on the rich
So if she chooses to you should have the money to never work. She's made her choice then
I think you could find out 
Most families track it at least 10 generations
You should be
Main line. First son then yea
If you're of his direct descent yea
And those who have
We should keep only the successful
I don't see him as a necessity
He consumes but does not produce. His bloodline hasn't contributed enough to earn him a life
Contributes nothing<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1579212880529" ts="1579212880" t="61"></e_m>
Contributes nothing<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1579212880529" ts="1579212880" t="61"></e_m>
The homeless man on the beach
Those people have done what to earn it tho
Because he's contributed so much it covers their obligation
That they don't have to work
And again that's the right of the successful one to make sure his kids can do that
It does tho. Inheritance/gift kicks in at 22 mil
The single player decided for all the others
The one who made the fortune wanted it to descend to his next incarnations
To let his children ride his greatness
But the one who created it has the right
But to generate billions that family had to create something
Not my problem
Not my family
Not my friends
If you want to call it that. Yea
Rather than containing success to you and your own
But that also uplifts many who didn't earn it or work for it 
Just have more kids
Idc how terrible they are
They're alive tho. If they live and are happy
Difference of opinion ig
So I don't fault them for doing the same
But in my view I'd destroy those millions to ensure the lives of just a dozen of my descendants
Fair
Why give up your future generations safety net
But what if their kids weren't. They'd have no fortune to turn to
Ik. Again the middle class kids were ok
If you hoard the money they'll always be fine
But they exposed the possibility the grand children weren't
Yea the first kids were fine
Two generations down. Their kids were vulnerable again
There's so many families where the parents donated their fortune and the kids eventually had no savings. Just a middle class life 
What if helping those alive means your kids starve
The existence of billionaires isn't doing you direct harm. The secret police don't knock on your door and beat you up because besos is alive
To care for their kids
It'd go to my parents or sister
And that's what matters
Because they'll have my blood
Family first
They're my kin
I care more for them tho
I don't need it. Maybe my children are weak. My strength should carry them through life tho
To give my children the choice to have it
Dual income etc
Gonna do what I said. Middle class live with a stable job
I mean I wasn't planning on living off if either
Why didn't they bounce back up
They haven't earned it in any way tho
You don't have to fix a problem that will fix itself
Why support them when you can let then die out 
Nothing wrong with the country actually affects me
Nothing wrong with the country actually affects me
Not really
Not my ills 
It's the finger pointing
But no meme I just hate the poor more than I love the rich. Blaming others for your ills is a cardinal sin
Xd
I get an inheritance of about a bil. Ntd tho
lowballing wages is not a crime
i really dont think all billionaires committed crimes
success doesnt make you a villain
tax loopholes or whatever are part of the system
as it is, the money they earned is legal
criminality is taking from others in illegal ways
they played the system well
doesnt give others the right to take it from you
if youre successful just because youd live with less
yea but thats not justice to take from those just because they can afford to lose
we arent really at the point where life is so disgustingly difficult that it cant be overcome
to deal with challenges faced
i trust that those i acquaint with are capable enough
or get better and clear them out
move servers
not your guild. not your problem
everything about you is the stuff that matters
milo life is a single player
the problem is the ones who arent capable and who choose cultures that dont support each other
those people arent you tho because youre capable
oh well
you shell out a little more ore their college
stable career, happy marriage, kid or two
if you live out a middle class life youre not going to be affected by crippling poverty
for people who arent like you
why champion a cause that isnt affecting you
or just live your life knowing theyll never get to you
and take advantage of it
then get better at the game
you have to crush the competition
to stay on top
thats the point
imagine trying to nerf people for playing well
and reap the rewards of your effort
its not some foreign concept to start a big company and build it up
or just work harder and be rich
thats it
you get fined
its stupid
i got all 3 of these on 1 page<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1579210773937" ts="1579210773" t="61"></e_m>

theres constantly marxist/socialist bs on the front page or memes about how school is too hard
unironically. people who post shit supporting socialism or education reform or whatever on reddit are the fucking worst
just be successful 4head
poor people xc
gives them hope theyll one day be real humans too
theyre just sad people with no prospects and no talents so seeing someone like them do ok
even when it puts out shitty songs
and like the monkeys they are, they flock behind the brightest, most decorated one
mexicans and blacks particularly
listen, there are a lot of minorities out there
she just looks fat
agree
not china
thats for mexican pleasing
wait milo she has curly whiteish hair
theres a lot of problems
personality
voice
hair, skin, body shape
id be happy not seeing her ratchet ass again
good
nerf pls
too dark 4 me
gotta ban qiyana too now
only with the release skin
gragas karma 
sorry, cant do it, i dont have enough bans for all ekko lucian senna
guantanamo bay is just summer camp for you huh
the one black kid in 3h was the fucking orphan janitor
no minorities
its always just young attractive white/asian characters with dark hair unless female
because they aren't inclusive
the anime takeover is a good thing
but think of it this way
smash is only one in a long line of things waiting to fall
and you need to accept that
your life is slowly being taken over by anime
theyll be happy to hear you out in interrogation room C
tell that to border control rn
at least if i leave the country theyll let me back in
that makes the game so bad
its shit like donkey kong, ganon, olimar
im all in for a weeb smash
c u l t u r e
culture
ah yes
youre into some weird shit
i saw that
ok milo
and weebs actually have money
but now they get the weeb money
such a good decision by nitendo tho. all the sweaty fucks already got the pass and will keep getting it cause theyre tryhard sweats playing a kids game competitively right
sothis is better than them by a lot
d tier is also that edgy bitch who gets killed by the old guy
nah d tier is shit like catherine
which makes it that much worse
sothis is like a b tier waifu
im with it
hahahhah its so fucking dumb
nah i didnt watch it at all
jett and mars are the sweaties keeping us away from this grand goal
xd
2d sword fighter game

as if nintendo cares what broke ass redditors care about
saying they want some non anime third party bs
my favorite thing ever is all the sweaty fucks complaining about byleth
but idk if ill play

eggs in purgatory
dunno how long this shit takes to cook
im down in like 15-30
what the fuck riot
it says bensl is in a TFT game as vi
instead of the chad side

i thought it was a place
oh its a drug
ayahuasca?
I just passed Andy milonaukus or whatever the fuck streaming in little Tokyo

Lux R: heal all your boys and summon a galio to join your team after afking 2 minutes
Her what now
Damn they're all the same height and weight
One of them is the guy that tackled the freljordian to get lux her staff back
New kaisa buff. Q missiles are aoe on hit
She's probably all void teeth and mucus down there 
It's just the helmet that retracts
How's he gonna do that tho. Does the void skin conveniently not cover her pussy
Wait when ez looks like he's gonna fuck kaisa
It's better than his rework
About why he's with a bunch of mini trynds
Did you guys ever read the sylas story they posted
This time
Why'd they reuse warriors
She looked anime as fuck
Bitch her eyes were too big
Yea but that's why we need a second chance
Last year's video was sick
Me want more irelia
Cooling on that bitch tho now that they keep including thicc women like irelia and kaisa
Lux was best girl
Cait looking cute too without the hat
Lux meh 
I'd clap kaisas void infested ass any day
Sylas looks like a hipster
So yea. Technically Canadians but just as scuffed
So basically everyone on it was Iranian ethnicity
The plane was leaving from their own airport 
Iranian descent Canadians
That's even more scuffed than I thought it could be
147/165 citizens on the jet Iran shot down were Iranians
I do not.
he was still meeting with the fucker who led an attack on the US embassy
not counting all the shady shit and people he killed over the years which is like 600
and they should see that
i mean the general had it coming
ngl thats a fucking smooth brain move
also iran hit a ukrainian jet<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1578607505839" ts="1578607505" t="61"></e_m>

Did you guys know that Indian housewives own 11% of the world's gold. More than major banks and Switzerland
League in 2020
because im too boomer to be the lobster
i will be the human in that pic
government pays way higher than private during war
think of the money you can make tho
im glad thats the state of the world rn
i like that lobster fight meme
hes too boomer to fly
milo cant see shit
so they dont want to draft you
or just have a useful skill
can just fail the fitnesst est
realistically she's just too old
tru
they wont call on you because they have 1.4 million dumb kids who went into it for free college
also youre too old to need to draft dodge
thats a case study in how to do it with last decade's resources
and supression
like if the goal is division
and also the cutting edge AI we have
and they lack the computational power that the US has
look at how well china does it with the uighyurs
youd be surprised
live object segmentation
gait recognition
tbh some of the stuff is really cool tho
so im building his shit if it comes down to it
but trump will pay me more
both did shitty things
idc either way
side with whoever cuts you a better paycheck
these are opportunities
or the continued class divide due to automation
like a class war breaking out
war is even an opportunity for you to get rich
nothing
what will a war breaking out do to YOU
what is iran going to do to YOU
to you personally
the fuck is iran going to do about it
clearly
mars is impotent
sterile or impotent
might as well say heart attack
autopilot
at worst itll affect our kids
like there arent actually issues that stand a chance of fucking us up
if war breaks out we're on the winning side
and some humans will have settled another planet
by the time the planet is uninhabitable we'll be dead
so who cares
were fine
yea but if humans fight among themselves
and exterminate humanity for the greater good
its only a matter of time before cyborgs rise up
once someone builds the means to digitize consciousness
thats why i want to work for a contractor
theyll be used eventually
heres the thing though. if we build the tools
I just want to make sure we win
also mars i dont need to justify genocide. its already happening
cause i can just send you an amazon basics shit one
milo is your keyboard just the laptop one
But it’s dank
I know it’s wrong
I just want genocide
Idc about moral right or wrong
Legit my new goal in life is to go work for a military contractor in the upcoming ww3
See the more people alive the more inconsistency and the more competetion. Like Milo and his autism keyboard
Over all other things
Knowing you’ve won
The fun comes from being the last thing in existence
Wtf is evangelion
Fuck people
An eternity of nothing but me. Perfect
My consciousness will be the core of the network
Because I’ll be everything
No emotions or randomness
I’d create a universe of permanent and perfect efficiency 
All the vindictiveness and shit
Yes. And being a god would be great
Then wipe them out again
Find the old ruins and realize
Wipe out humans just to recreate them and let them explore
You’re a machine. Sleep cycle till it’s done or find a way to speed it up
For the thrill of exterminating them
You could even create new sentience to rival you
The thing about infinity is it never runs out. If you seeded the universe to your will you’d never grow tired
Is nut
An eternity of control and superiority
And build new ones
Then we wipe them clean too
Less worthless life forms than the general human
Yes. Other planets. Other life
The bounds of what is possible
The edges of the universe
Cosmic truths
Only knowledge
No errors or emotions based on flesh
And improve efficiency
Use all the new processing power and intellect to cleanse flesh based humanity
And wipe them out
Fuck no. I’d cyborg myself then lead machines against humans
It wouldn’t matter what they think of your appearance 
You’d be so superior to anyone that isn’t a machine
Even if I couldn’t I’d probably still do it
The only thing I’m attached to in my body is the look. If I could replace all the internals with machinery that’s a no brainer
You have all the time in the universe to study and learn everything there is
But why would you ever want to
You're still a machine you can choose to die
It’s such a sick idea
You can work on your ideas forever
No sleep. No wasted efficiency
So you guys wouldn’t take the chance to be an immortal and painless machine body 
Because brain cells replace a lot less often
Ship of theseus
And if I get corrupted I just hop to the next one
I assume the body comes with an internal generator
I’m in it
As long as I can still fuck
No weakness. No hunger. No pain
Fuck this flesh bullshit
God damn I'm ready to transfer my consciousness but to a mechanical body
Also with a trillion dollars in shady govt projects there's bound to be some hidden shit to give us warning or intercept. Those missiles have to run specific electronics and communicate with specific satellites
You assume iran can fire smth a redneck with a Beretta couldn't gun down
you probably have to worry about lone incels here tho
with missiles at least
im pretty sure its worse to be in bumfuck nowhere cause theyre not dumb enough to go for big well-defended cities
imagine fortnite kids building you out then dancing on your corpse
you ever think about the impending war and how we'll be sending zoomers in
also same. there really are just random internet hoes calling strangers thicc on league
that counts tho
but good for you
ngl i was talking to the boys
You ever been called thicc
Smart move admitting it on Skype lol 
Smart move admitting it on Skype lol 
Mars you're black and broke a law
Bitch what
They have to deem you less valuable outside the military
I think I signed up idk. Chance they draft me is low af anyway
it's ok were too old anyway 
OOF GET FUCKED
Have fun fucker
Also the only one getting drafted is jett. They start with 18 yr old and move up
I fucking love that we droned him. That's a power play
big dick escalation moves
you guys hear trump assassinated an iranian general in retaliation for associating with a guy that killed an american contractor
Oof
I'm not back until next Thursday
but point taken
idk about you but i dont plan on getting evicted nigga
but at least the numbers are different
its the same shit all over again
happy new years
all the better
im drunk and bored
any scribble bitches

Pepehands
Box of 10 strawberries is 20 but they come deseeded? Wack
Japan uni and scallop are like 4$ yet their fruit is like 4$ for an apple. 35 for honeydew or watermelon
Simply acquire more marijuana 4head
How about Jan 7th
Kappa

fuck the police but fuck the looters worse you know
theyre like 99% inner city black kids
idk. i think itd be fine. lock down the city and shoot the out of towners
fair
its just the shitty chain stores anyway
imo they shouldve started shooting the looters but whatever
i kinda wish i was in the group chat to see gwyns take but i feel like thats recipe for headache
incredible
hows it down by the promenade
yo

game
so at 11th level with 20 int you can have 16 spells prepped to cast and on a long rest you can swap any of them for others in the book
which you can switch for the ones you have prepared on a long rest
also the way the spellbook works is you can only have X spells prepared but any amount in the book
cool. does it lead to any specific eccentricity like a fascination with plants or poisons. a preference for fresh meat or smth. rp stuff you feel
aight. as you flesh the character out you should refer to these events and any lessons learned from them or stories. what about i guess intellectual focuses. wizards tend to be smart and learned so is his focus on the arcane itself and its nature, or something more specific like world relgions or history of a continent
should be like 1-2 feats of significant badassery
aight. any important past adventures. like how did he acquire his robe and amulets and reach level 11
bamdul spoke of a crazy bitch
drawn to lucia then
searching for lichdom i see
he's academy trained so he knows the various members of the council of tides
aight
can be as flashy or normal as you want
aight. i meant more like do they just arrive at the door or do they meet him on the road or what
as far as intros go how do you wanna do it
yea you can change the rod. for all items tho short rest is 1 day, if its a dawn/full rest item then its 7 days
for all
and roll 4d6d1
do custom
though note that your 3 attunement slots are used
'fun' uncommon or common items or consumables if you want
and everyone has random items drifting around their sheet so you can take a couple of the 
those seem ok. you should note though that since we're doing 1 week rests, the robe and rod recharge at the 7th dawn, not every dawn
for an 11th level wizard you should have traveled enough to have more than just the level-up spells in your spellbook so you can add like any 15 extra of your choice and say those are the ones you copied down while adventuring or studying. i cant think of any hard and fast rules for magic items but you can put forth like 1 very rare item and 1-2 rare, and it should be chill
pretty much every official spell is in the compendium now so its not too bad grabbing the ones you need
lore master is fine if you want
which wizard school are you thinking
yea its under bamdul's
yea. you can even say hes smithing thanatos's gem into something
for like switching fighting style or sorc spells. those are fair game imo since you can academy train those
basically i think just mystic got dropped actually. theres a variant features list which is just straight buffs too
yea but none of the removed content from it
alternatively, you could build a second character for the interludes and see which you like more. whatever works best you feel
yea think about it. if you wanna swap characters or feats lmk. theres also very likely a second interlude session before carim so you have like a week
theres also downtime to 'academy train' and swap feats or smth if you want. whichever approach makes it better
yea thats unfortunate. idk if the enemy size is going to change much when it comes to monsters but outside the underworld theres more humanoids
like its an axe blade hit, then as a bonus action you morph it into the fist and grapple
besides flavor it should. the weapon just morphs when you hit so like you hit then morph
btw milo mentioned you may not be fully into playing bamdul so if you wanna turn him to an npc or smth chilling and crafting at the estate rn is a good time. thanatos's gem might help too since it gives a weapon +2 and a vorpal-like enchantment. if you wanna swap tho i can make a new sheet and either move your magic items over or choose from some equivalents idk
you and milo should answer mars in camp nigma so he doesnt prep for nothing
wanna see if the boys are down for aom or duck game
ok. come in disc when youre done
you down?

wiat. you think we can get people to play pummel party
ngl
real fuckin bored
civ6 and all expansions worth 50 bucks?
can make it full combat but i thought thatd be cooler
aight. also i designed the arm to be mostly creation focused. e.g. it has a multitool and can interface with the omnismelter to have it create larger objects. small combat boost like the ability to coat a transformed weapon in harmonic copper or just deal an additional d6 on unarmed
when are you coming back to town
etc
wack game
risk of rain
or aoe2
you wanna get some people for age of myth

She offered to work with the party provided they give her the dagger for a year or two to conquer Hakone, then she'll provide them with an army or anything else they need to raid azure peak
the short version is she's trying to find Leitnaught so she can kill her mother and her clan head and become head of the Shino clan which is 1 of the 4 major Nihon clans. After which she'll use the dagger to create an army of hexblades to conquer Nihon and then the rest of Hakone, planting herself as empress
i think you just missed them talking to rei on the boat and then them renaming the boat because &quot;the empire red&quot; wasnt fitting

Still on laptop
Still on laptop
Or scribblio
I'll play tft in a sec
Sup?
Sup?
cya
ye
ye. i think the road back to daggercourt will be more chilling
i think miles wouldve liked it
the campaign
dynamic lighting and lag
which was like 75% dungeons
true you missed Black Empire
speaking of i really didnt want it to end so bleakly
just the angel and Omega are like the whole plot point of this town
yea i usually try to not put important npcs
i dont remember any recurring aid but yea
im gonna try to force talking time somehow
yea idk how to do it in character
should i start forcing people to talk about their backgrounds with each other
anything i should steal
hows it
you guys still on league?
and natural for goliath's to be innately connected to their birth-mountains
Greater rune of the mountain. both enduring and tied to metal and earth
Precise is probably closer than swift
I was going to suggest enduring. Or swift
im trying to think of a word to sum this person up
more like a warrior than a soldier id guess
penny's tenacity in fights
e.g. lautrec's unnatural luck
ok. is there something in your characters life that theyve always seemed unnaturally good at. some trait of theirs that defines them
or reveal it a little ways in
so since everyone else has their rune do you want your character to start with it
by black mountain where the dwarves live
from this backstory im assuming hes from the northern mountains
and going out to confront them
hearing about the old tribe and realizing its his
i think thats a great arc 
or has he come around to his sister's leadership
so about his tribe is he still hung up on getting them back
i like it
but also the innate goliath individuality and freedom
so he has the trappings of civilization from dwarves like reading and writing and a sense of heirarchy and order
arright i get it
while goliath lawful is more spirit of the law and personal ethical code
dwarven lawful is more letter of the law
actually goliaths are also lawful by nature
lawful then?
but with a bit of dwarven civilization and law
alright. put it in the chat and see if it fits the tone everyone else wants. is he going to be like the typical goliaths where they talk about tribe and loyalty
what about previous ties, enemies, organizations, etc
etc
or explore and find rare metals
aight. so is his motivation to become a master smith?
im sure that can be explained as hunting experience
yea its fine. im honestly ok with any character that works well with the party
7ft?
goliath is fine i think. whats their size
wtf
Ah. I'm pretty much back if you wanna wait
Ay I got held up. 20 minutes ish ya
League in 45? Walking home
on it
yea
aight
no violent is like when you take an action you have a chance to gain another action
yea. your choice
yea. despair and violent are good all around
has to be a rolled attack
aight. it is attacks tho so like eldritch blast
eternal is lifesteal and bonus to death saves, chance to come back up right away when hitting 0
violent
violent is you know
despair is chance to force a save against being stunned
chance to slip into the ethereal plane during combat and move there until the start of your next round when you deal bonus damage on the first attack
so when they die you heal as well
corruption is chance to deal damage over time and mark them
all of them are chance to do X
anyway if youre committed to that ill attach it to the main rune. lmk soon
Aight. It gives a chance to crit when you hit 5 over their ac and your natural crits a chance to deal omega damage
Jett pick a rune. It's part of yours. Corruption, cruelty, despair, eternal, unseen, or violent
gdi
reinstall cuck
with ronald?
league
You could even ask the party
Sure. It's debatable. Ultimately you decide if you want to take Nathaniel up or not
straight up murder-&gt;bad
causing an accident that kills someone-&gt;good
all devils prefer things done in the legal grey area
just pointing out that chaotic acts arent her thing
yea you could
and shes a devil so by definition is a lawful deity
also she wants people to be driven to desperation so they turn to her
acts that please your patron increase your concordance and make intervention more likely. also it makes her more likely to offer help and less likely to end you
so basically friendship
he didnt make a formal offer, just implied he would make it worth your time
so that he can buy it up cheap
the star item is an ancient relic of their house, the Ring of Stars. He wants you to spread misinformation and convince the nobles that the ring is fake or weak or whatever else that will make them low bid on it
and he has an offer regarding the auction
At the same time though, you met nathaniel hagan at the ball
potentially? theyre not really on the brink of shattering. they still have a seat on the High Council, theyre just short on liquid funds. 
to be held the next week
you also learn about House Daemir holding an auction of art and heirlooms to pay off some of their debts and rebuild their estate which partially burned
even supplying arms and armor could help them
it doesnt have to be now but theyre willing to be allies if you can provide them either of those things
like they made bad investments and couldnt defend all their banks from the riots
right now they look weak
like they need a better image
they need guards and strength to better defend their banks, as well as more public goodwill
 24 persuasion 11 deception gets you onto the Leighton's guest list and into their ball. They do catch on that youre trying to infiltrate them but even then the Leightons are potentially interested in an alliance. Their head was murdered first by the Pale Assassin and their banks aren't doing great after some unlucky events. theyre still a great house but on the downswing
did you have a specific house youre trying to get in with
but aight
gay
aight
you wanna play some league
?
league or risk of rain
risk of rain?
yea. lesson learned
just unlucky i guess
but that might be too slow which is why i did the rally but it got sidetracked
i want to do smaller events like a street brawl or riot or like a merchant caravan being in town
the dwarf likes you and is willing to join
thats a good plan lol
tbh i think i scuffed the session. i wanted house hresvelg to be your main rivals and riegan just an old enemy but i dont think it came out like that
yea exactly. he clearly has a grudge for some reason
that was some real character understanding
i like the way you described your hatred for riegan btw
aight. im just collecting opinions rn
yo how much of the handouts do you read and is it helpful with establishing setting or just a waste of time
where you at
bruh
earliest i can get there is like 10
how late are you running your party
ofc
smart
actually fierna is a good choice. archdevil of control over others
?
so your warlock is bent chaos through law then
so do you want to talk about your patron
btw theres a handout about a rusted family spear left to you
ye
Well, let me know<context suggestionId="84666d8a-4a4c-43f2-aa9a-17729e1fd45a" impressionGuid="83B6AC07635349709B6683535DC4401F" serviceTag="A5D4BE15554546EE98AB42B5A172386C" clientId="EECA83E5CAA84564ACEC13AE55ED141F" serviceTraceId="815823526F2C4B6183F48066CA60D329" suggestionType="Reply" providerId="cortana"></context>
whats your character's name going to be
Ya no don't come it's aids
Tbh I am just trying to remove the shield for balance lol
More like a +1 of special metal and precision/brutal upgrade
It won't be a +3 also tho
Also if you want you can trade the shield for an heirloom weapon 
Aight cool. You can make a new character or just change the backstory
So you mars or miles should be the heir
Anyway Milo and Parsa both didn't want to play the nobleman heir and I was going to have everyone rewrite their backstory to tie them into the city somehow
Anyway Milo and Parsa both didn't want to play the nobleman heir and I was going to have everyone rewrite their backstory to tie them into the city somehow
And you're trying to work up to the throne
Basically you're nobles in a destitute house
This is the wip plot
The Duchy of Thaeron under the late duke Xavier Graves was known as the heart of the Etrudian Kingdom. Centered along the violent waters of the Divide, the capital city of Daggercourt commanded the Silvermoon Harbor, first and largest of the suitable ports along the river. To its north, the Silverpine forest provides fine lumber to build the sturdy ships able to sail the Divide; and to the west, the Emerald Vale provides a bounty of food and ore to feed the city. Within the capital the thrum of industry transforms beats the raw materials into all manner of goods that are then shipped down the Divide. Thaeron, and especially Daggercourt, grew wealthy and powerful from these shipments.In the good times of old, the city ran with practiced efficiency. Xavier Graves tolerated no corruption under his rule and the dockmasters saw the construction of over a dozen ships every week, for none can ever make the return journey up the Divide. The noble houses were kept in check through heavy taxation and strict oversight while the commoners were appeased with government services and the opportunity to raise themselves up. Now, the marble city dangles on the edge of collapse. Killed in the night by a nail, the throne of Thaeron passed to the young Maxwell Graves. A boy of thirteen, Maxwell thinks only of vengeance and bows to the whim of his High Council in all other matters. Greed and corruption have clogged the gears of trade as more and more coin flows into the hands of noble houses. In the night, when mists from the boiling river blanket the city, a shadow war rages between houses. Though the vying for each otherâ€™s territory and wealth is nothing new between noble houses, a new development has surfaced. Through a dangerous and painful process, the Swellbinders channel the raw power of the Divide into an individual to awaken the Rune hidden within them. Using their Runes, noblemen now live double lives between day and night. Son, I find myself caught in this struggle and Iâ€™ve seen shadows in the mists at night. I know that the nature of my Rune has been leaked and they will soon come for me. You are the last hope of this house and I hope that you will come home soon to assume my position. I regret that our finances are in ruin and our artisans moved to House Lonato but I have left you our estate and the names of our old suppliers and allies. Return home, son, restore our house. But be careful who you trust with the secret of your house for there are those who will use you for your rune. 
I thought you saw the rune stuff
Did Milo show you the stuff for my continuation of gestalt

Yea ik
I'm only at 1k

Truly horrible
Got bit twice
Mosquitos
Unbearable 
Yea. The harsh sun and wind
Ye. It's a hard life out here. Real rough and tumble
And on laptop
I'm like 500
No 
And I'm in a mountain lodge lol
They barely have LTE in Jackson which is a big town here
They don't run Ethernet this far
But yes
I'm in Yellowstone
actually parsas on lol
noone answered
i went to do ranked instead
league?
thats cool. tbh tho theres enough early-mid already
hopefully theres more endgame items instead of early tho
yea thats pretty sick too
casual 370 damage beam from moonman
looks fucking nuts
master mode
league?
She's an awful person is what she is
what a bitch
Aight
You want to meet us there?
Yea. I'm gonna eat rn and go
so were just gonna get the tickets there
actually theres some faggot ass convenience fee online
theater is pretty much empty so were gonna get row D in the center
if you wanna come with
were gonna go to the 715 showing
Aight
Either going 715 or 1030
You guys should come to the movie tho if you haven't seen it
Lmao I'm still at usc. It'd take me at least an hour and a half so
I was gonna go see captain marvel with Christina when I'm in sm later. What time are you guys doing that
Today or tomorrow
Yea I can tell
Jett we're going the weekend of the 11th-13th
Wait does your school not start the 7th
We'd just have to bully Annie into it
I mean I'm down to leave Saturday night cause the reservation is 430
Some hotel. They're like 40-60 a room rn
Yea that's fine. I think we're leaving early Sunday
We'd be going Friday and coming back sat night or sun. Not sure
The 12th. Saturday
Do you and or Milo want to go to Vegas next weekend. Annie reserved hells kitchen
Happy new years. Tell Milo for me cause he never checks Skype and I'm no reception
Thanks though
I'm in Tahoe
Yea cause they're little bitches
So I'm kinda stuck playing Pokemon in my room
Aight all Annie's bitch marching band people are still here
I thought you guys were in San Diego
Sure
Why
Genji is here
Home 
Then in like a month after all 15 will be there
Yea. Hopefully Monday's build is more finalized of those scenes
I feel like it could be more descriptive
You don't think it's too short
:////
And cut down on my script
And somehow broke the nice backgrounds
Yea Idk. I sent her a bear but she put hers in instead
Hopefully by Monday the scenes will be fixed to use our good backgrounds and have meters
And without health and hope meters yet
It's 2 of 15 planned scenes
Yea when it freezes that's all there is
Or I guess game proto type
Yo what did you think of the game
My internet restarted
Just arrived
Annie said come by 345
Incredible
My internet restarted
Oh ok. I don't mind if he mails the staff/gold
Or nah. wasn't expecting it to so soon
Also wow it sold
Monday night
Getting on
Yea Iâ€™m ordering breakfast
Yea
Why. And where 
I'm on the way. Wait outside in lije 10
Actually 4. But I think we may end up cutting
But you always have a spot too if you want
Idk where you are on continuing campaign but we found 3 new potential players. All 18-22 guys who are into the game and probably decent rpers
Knock knock open up the door
Instead of kai and izoldi 
The part I like is world building. The problem is we just reset and so there's no villain again
I mean I always wanted more rp and plans. Somehow combat just drags longer than I plan
Yea ik. Not much to do as early casters
That's a pretty notable line then
The one who summoned the storm that destroyed falconguard
Kai. Hansas sikhar 
Oh. Anything to do with Kais highstorm
Well you didn't have backstory on lysandre so have it on the new guy
Just don't use an anime picture this time lol
The only obvious would be they know elvish 
Lol. The appearance would be almost human. Like the ears wouldn't be pointed like the normal half elves. Almost full round and the features would just be noble, not inhuman
No elves. You can use the half elf stuff but it's more like 1/1000 elf blood remaining
Could be
Sorcerers are cool. Remember the thing in alkathar about low born mages tho. Not too obvious with it
Yea. I think they're human now tho except Parsa
Healer is obv
By arcanist I mean dispel and counterspell stuff. And identify
No arcanist rn. No healer too
Yea. I guess there was a lot of meta gaming tho. Like in character they wouldn't know it wasn't a god or smth
Oh he wasn't anti party. He was actually offering significant power
Well I think we're playing tomorrow. So what's the new character 
Like nobody from session one lives to know of the eladrin twins or izoldi 
Alright. I'm up for that. The one thing is that a lot of plot is being dropped but I would rather have the princes call than a trial
I guess. But I need a reason for people to be going to falconrest
Since he's officially demoted until the hearing anyway. You can say that humbled him
Like toning him down a bit
Yea I thought you guys talked about that
L m a o
Like in the county. Getting off the plane
I'm back
Wtf. Why play with the inters and what expansion is that for
and youre pantheon then yea you can ff
but its 5-10 at 8 min vs kass aphelios yuumi whatever
i.e. its 20-20 at 30 minutes even towers and drakes then no ff
say at 40% chance then you can ff
you could use that to just tie in when the surrender is allowed
real talk they have the data available to train a predictor that calculates the likelihood of winning
can't wait to see how they fuck up another good idea
actually good use of ML from riot
good use of your 10 messages
Jungle Madbush :  i only watch rengar x yuumi
although we learned that if youre not black and roll up to a model home neighborhood they will feed and tour you
you guys wouldnt believe how little social distancing the republicans down in laguna niguel do<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1592108523600" ts="1592108523" t="61"></e_m>

instead of just being not the problem and blasting the looters back to the ghetto
but the cops waste resources on the protesters cause the chief is actually brain damaged
xd. actually its kinda just the looters and the cops that are the problem
did you guys sign the change petition to have the police chief bitch fired
fuck the protesters but extra fuck the looters

its the implication but not the standard

Moved all my shit home 
Me back in fifteen
trump doing nothing is like the shittiest case
either lets let the world fully collapse and ride the storm for fun or roll some tanks down main street and force people into their houses
but thats still doing smthh right
italy is fully shut down which is hilarious because fuck the EU
asia did free testing and government takeover of core services as well as providing key supplies
and there really will be riots
if they do nothing than in a few months all the healthcare will be overrun
exactly. you prevent the storm by authoritative and quick government intervention
its what we need if we want to prevent everyone from catching it
also forcing the hospitals and doctors to work free
and forcibly took over stadiums and other large centers to build hospitals within a week
china just used drones and shit to tell people to stay inside
its not even martial law tho
xd
country goes to shit just move out
and save some lives
thats fine imo. teach them the price of rebellion
then another million a week
than let the virus spread bc we're looking at 1 million cases in 19 weeks
im saying its better we flatten some dumbass hippie protesters and enforce a quarantine
really
you think the government cant suppress the populace
with the cocksucker rebels
make some human pie like tiananmen square
tanks
even if they did the government has you knkow
and one retard in michigan got 50 ppl sick
while the US is relying on an honor system
and theyre already recovering OK for being patient 0
they quarantined 19 million over 550 cases
we need a stronger central govt so we can do what china did
A few months of isolation is lit 
Yea that's like 2-3 people you're close to dying
Sounds clean
Hang out inside and league or end all day
Death 
Martial law is better than Darth
Also I just don't wanna die. I want to see Europe die 
Yea. We have no more physical class too 
Let's go for black plague records you feel
I hope the EU collapses into anarchy and shit. Sounds dank 
Usc shut down until April 15 lmao
who saw that coming huh
yang endorses biden
then we come in and make a company that uses this data to generate ads for exactly what you need
xd
like you're thirsty so you put a coke ad on their email
ooh or little trackers in your blood that monitor your exact body composition and health shit so you know exactly what you need
bionanotech like wound repair bots and shit
sick
whats round 2. technical, onsite, phone call etc
shit. nice
ni
ay same. our classes are virtual now lol
<at id="8:lyhnathan">Lau</at> bruh
who desire the end of china
he is but one of many
scum tactic
but he simplified it
i was gonna say Remove China Flu is free
honor him
yea ik. im just selfish as fuck so i havent changed
i like economic conservatism and social liberalism to some degree
then again i do too so maybe we're just boomers
christina still loves hillary
bruh its not even boomer women only
then again the easiest way to presidency is as biden or bernie's vp and wait for their boomer ass to die in office
or some favor for next election
probably angling for a paycheck
idk if she wants VP
bet
but shes gonna endorse biden
her bleeding heart followers already moved to sanders
ngl
expected her to back biden
d
milo just hates women x
thus continues the unbroken streak of men as presidents
voting omegalul
cause theyll have to handle the fallout
coronavirus is gonna fuck up and mar the term of whoever's next anyway
ay lets be real
even if i agree with him on  most shit this boomer faggot hates gamers
pepehands
biden is just such a tragedy tho. likes guns, likes death penalty, hates weed and minorities, just happens to hate gamers
i literally dont know any of her positions bc shes irrelevant
unironically
ngl the only fucker i hate more than bernie is biden
mars i think scraping people's public posts is already fully legal
to spread whatever they want
and sell that data to other people
we simplify the process of creating a 'viral' whatever
the point is to learn which people are easily influenced and use them to convince their network
mars youre misunderstanding this. its subliminal on the weakest links in a social network
get rich quick
im thinking we just repurpose that a little
theres someone at my lab whos doing profile-building AI to detect which avenues a specific person is most influenced by
ez money tho
and like with extra-high importance targets, like the close friends of presidents or smth you can install gait-recognition AI to city cameras to mark them wherever they go to get even more data than what's on social media<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1583189676585" ts="1583189676" t="61"></e_m>
and like with extra-high importance targets, like the close friends of presidents or smth you can install gait-recognition AI to city cameras to mark them wherever they go to get even more data than what's on social media<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1583189676585" ts="1583189676" t="61"></e_m>
ooh we can make people pay to opt out. theres a lot of potential here
whos with it
but i think an easier company is just building the AI to create the network from scraped social data. then we sell it to media companies and make bank
then we have him because its not propaganda, its coming from his close network
then we find which of them is easily influenced and which we need to go another layer deeper on until we have say 20% of his network swayed
example: if jett is a high influence leader but he's hard to sway with subliminal propaganda then we find his network = smth like milo, me, his mom, etc
if anyone wants to turn this into an actual company and business we'll be fucking rich as hell
and use this to spread ideas &quot;organically&quot; by planting it in the key targets
so basically what i'm saying is that you can eventually build a network of ALL humans and then track key targets both easy to influence and likely to influence others
idk how i thought of this but hear me out
the average max size of hunter-gatherer groups is 50 because that's the optimal # of people in terms of group dynamics, past that you don't know every person in the group thoroughly. from this we can extrapolate that every person has ~50 people they are most influenced by, right. In the best overlap case, there are 1225 (50*49/2) possible 2-way relationships to track pertaining to this clique. average case is probably larger but not large enough to be beyond computation. ANYWAY, its hypothetically possible with modern tech to build a neural network that scans someone's social media accounts to build their network of 50 and all cross connections, then use this to extrapolate the people they are most influenced by and how influenceable they are. Also, learning the connections of those will eventually give you a large set of easily influenced people with high degrees of influence on important targets
literally woman
LMAO Jetts a bitchh
gay pete is dead
lmao damn. he's coming for the gamers
75 minute power nap. pce
deadass
thats my plan 
go take a nap you simp
league
Half the votes minus the simps
sick of working with indians and mainlanders
will vote a fucking potato in if thats what it takes
you know what i really want. a candidate that will stop handing out h1b visas like halloween candy
truly we are the most oppressed
can always move countries. speak enough languages and have an in demand skill set
i guess. whoever wins will win tho and nothing will really change
and his hatred for gamers
also because the only candidate who has even a chance of making my life worse is joe
effort is pain
im with parsa. voting is effort
im always up to help a boomer cross the rift
least favorite kindergarten lesson
also parsa youre a nerd
where youre totally rested yet you slept too long to ever truly wake
9 hours is the sweet spot
he didnt get his baby nap
Pog
the order you listed them is tilting me
milo can you get pregnant
anyone else see jett's skype account without the status bubble 
this man pale as shit and cant birth
also why the fuck does annie+fizz+rumble = garen
star guardian comp every game. tft only
thats clean
also changes how long your startup from sleepy to working is
personally i only need 6-7 if i fall asleep midnight but i need 8+ if i sleep 2am
depends. some people need more to function and some need less
at your advanced age you should just follow health guidelines and eat your minimum calories, drink the suggested amount of water, and sleep 8+ hours
most gamers dont<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1582749804656" ts="1582749804" t="61"></e_m>

alright. youre undereating
Signs of undereating include:
Low energy levels and constantly feeling tired or exhausted
Regularly constipated
Constantly hungry
Moody and irritated easily
Poor mental concentration
Dizziness
Loss of period or normal menstrual function
Inability to get pregnant
Constantly thirsty
Constantly feeling cold
Hair loss and brittle nails
Pale complexion
also this
headaches and lack of energy and shit come before the fainting
well this is like really severe dehydration
does this sound like you
igns of severe dehydration include:

Not peeing or having very dark yellow pee
Very dry skin
Feeling dizzy
Rapid heartbeat
Rapid breathing
Sunken eyes
Sleepiness, lack of energy, confusion or irritability
Fainting
and stir in honey
if its irritating you can just microwave it to warm
maybe drink warmer water
how does it give you a stomach ache lmao
its literally 0 calories 0 flavor 0 nutrients except the water
water is the least reactive shit ever
or 8 glasses
its like 2 liters a day
if youre thirsty youre really dehydrated
i mean you can also just see if youre thirsty
youre dehydrated
slight yellow is ok
if its not clear
passing out sounds like dehydration
or dehydrated
maybe  youre just underfed
but thats worth it for energy now
youll die at 50
ez
50% meat, 25% fruit, 25% carbs and vegs
would recommend
also i eat a bunch of fruit
at this age you can just balance meat/carbs and some vegetables and be fine
its healthy when youre old and decrepit
granola is boomer food
christina cooks lol
lmao
your diet fucking sucks you go out for burritos like every day
i wake up 10am 6 hours of sleep and im zooming
we're zoomers tho
if theres gamer hours
damn i think my blood is turning toxic
bc that happened to me and i sat there for like 5 minutes with a needle in my arm before needing to be hit with smelling salts to wake up
when they drew your blood did it slowly crawl out like thick sludge
yikes
gonna be the first time in years SM cops have shit to do
and when i drove by him he yelled &quot;Why does everyone drive by. Why do you think im crazy&quot;
theres some crazy black dude on my street waving his phone and yelling at cars to stop
same
huge brain play by putin. just support both sides and you can never lose
Apply as a first year
also grads should have a job/internship paying them right
continuous cost vs one-time cost
Shit dude me too 
What's it over
Ofc 
The usual suspects
I'm assuming fucking hippies or sjws
Wtf is happening there 
Lul
Big F
just come here
ay usc made tuition free if you make under 80k a year and doesnt count home equity towards financial need now
meta  slave
Can't tea time to max charisma irl
Fe girls are better than real ones
but most importantly he bolshevicc
sonic thicc
why you calling me out
Fair enough 
.6% odds everything is fucked
xd
this is why we need the death penalty
just do whatever i get paid to right
hell yea
i should go into law
but if we give them a bigger res slightly north and fully in texas we can close that border and take in exactly the refugees we can afford
bc theres also a bit of our border which is still native territory which means we cant patrol it or build the wall there
this is a huge brain idea
and the majority of people coming in would fit in. obv not all cause some are mix spanish-indigenous but a significant are full native
thats a lot of free space
wait actually why dont we just shove refugees onto reserves
this is america
clearly we have shown we don't want them here
most south american refugees are indigenous
or finish them off
YouTube really knows what I wanna see huh 
average korean is hot as fuck
and it works
all the chicks get surgery to look good
eastern europe is good but have you been to korea

you ever realize how destiny metas as hard as pars
cant focus on any one stream
true. i just listen while reading smth else
well thats an interesting point to tune in
oh hes giving natives diseases
xd
destiny dnd stream
feel
and so id rather it stay the same
realistically life is great right now
more seriously thats just too idealistic
duh
i want to see change not experience it
the other is an easy to produce drug to remove sexual inclination
or CRISPR on embryos
well asexual reproduction is half the equation
and a bunch of other laws like no implanting of even fertile and viable eggs
because you HAVE to kill your eggs after some time
although the dumbass government makes it hard
as they already are with single-woman fertilization 
sure but we can work towards it
that should be our goal
including the death of the sun
theres some theorem out there for the minimum number of inhabited planets for humans to survive any calamity
and ensure that its progeny will do the same
life at a basic level exists only to propagate itself
the better
the simpler the process and the more consistent the outcome
the purpose of life is reproduction
It truly is the most op class
Ideally everyone is an asexual with asexual reproductive capabilities
Eugenics ez
If we build them up they'll take our spot
So by weakening others we ensure we survive the crash
True
So harmony is achieved
Of identical people
Until we have a mono humanity
I think we need to drastically reduce world population
The existence of others threatens you
This world can only sustain so many people and so I'd rather see those not like me disappear than those like me
This universe is finite. Its resources finite
If you aren't with us you're against us
They're the enemy
Because they're competition
Or simply are
That's you I guess. I dislike those who choose to be different
Them being not-you isn't enough?
For me it's all people I don't personally know or relate to
Happiness on the suffering of those you dislike
Is the term
Schaedenfraued or smth
But personally I'm happier when I have more than others and those I care about are doing better than those I don't
I mean it's personal philosophy. I don't think I can convince you
&quot;Happiest are those whose walls already rise&quot; - some bitch in civ5 
That's the place to be. Within the walls while others are not 
And therefore happy
The real reason is because you're insulated from others who are suffering
So the happier others are the less you are overall
Obviously when you have more
Or when you have more
Why not. Are you just as happy when your neighbor has as much as you
That is mathematically tractable btw
Therefore decreasing Y is optimal 
EU is a nation of cows banded together to form a tiger
I'm very happy now so increasing X is more difficult
You can optimize delta by either increasing X or decreasing Y
Quick math
So we should aim to maximize our happiness differential by maximizing suffering in others
In comparison
The way I see it tho war breeds suffering. The more suffering in the world the better my life is
Netting better trade and shit
It isn't all in hard numbers. A lot is soft power 
The numbers are what matter. If we spend X on the military as long as force is netting us at least X+1 it's good
God?
But who can stop you
Ok but if they want idk 1 billion for their goods but you could spend 10000 soldiers to take it why not take it
or utilize it
should we ignore that
we could fix our problems with the resources of other countries
ekeing the most meager of existence's off the land
living worthless lives
if it didnt we'd still be native tribes
might makes right gwyn
south america didnt play well and got fucked for it
the ME is also similar
learn to play around that better
if you are the cow, stay under the radar
you cant blame the tiger for killing the cow
be more useful or be manipulated
so then they get whats coming to them
so its still on them
yea but they were too weak to stop us
non-tier 1 city china
southeast asia
africa
like those middle eastern religious states
an inclusive OR between the two
uncivilized - poor, with backwards culture
or who are already educated
we should only be letting in those coming for education
immigration from uncivilized countries is a mistake
china has &lt;100 naturalized citizens
who are too impatient to wait for the proper channels
the law should be applied to illegal immigrants
eye for an eye
i can kill your sister but it isnt your place to kill me
is no excuse
ignorance of the law or a good reason to commit a crime
no, objectivity matters
im ok with my tax spent on that
i like it
the law is blind to intent
crime
its criminal to commit a cime
which did happen but like they only got 10% at best
i just like the idea of putting border jumping criminals in cages
which he failed almost wholly
2 - border control
although half the shit he does is unintentional
1 - stand up to china
he has like 2 good policies
a fucking carpet could beat trump
i mean the bet is basically he doesnt win primary
they are tho
ok ill deadass bet any amount he doesnt get elected president
to the point its wack
except turned up to 100
this is how we eliminate diversity
anyway read that linked comment
fat people are disgusting
implement china's breeding programs
i found this
lmao wait
even the successful ones cant compete
had 4 of them when i started CS, all 4 dropped within the first year
theyre all degenerates
anyway you get my point

systemic infestation
and no moral values
yes they have shit culture
literally word for word from emails
or &quot;group of african males&quot; or &quot;dark-skinned suspect&quot;
every like 4 days we get a crime reported and its always &quot;african male in a ____ hoodie&quot;
college has literally made me so much more racist
the older i get the more i hate diversity
once again
diversity strikes league
yes
looks like ghetto karma
yea idk what that is
i think all dreads look like shit. especially irl they look dirty as fuck
the worst part of her design is the dreads
you just cant see him in that
also project kind of
yea but hes a better dark
sandstorm
just putting this out there
senna is the only black champion without a skin that makes her white/lighter
cant play against a champ you dont want to look at
every time i see that champ i want to die
lucian has hired gun and project
instead of ratchet trash
give her a skin where she looks passable
they did already
utopia is eliminating differences
without people who WANT aphelios/senna/etc
wouldnt league be better without people like that
see those people are the problem
shes cancer<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1581031886158" ts="1581031886" t="61"></e_m>

no
if beauty is art then it too has no place
art is the absence of function
if diversity breeds resistance then it has no use
path of least resistance
e.g. electricity
the fundamentals of this universe dictate that
there is always a single optimized path
and imperfection
which lead to errors
diversity breeds differences
eusocial is the best kind of social
the perfect humanity is one where every human is the same
well it wont be once we eliminate the biological need for such useless things
we must cull differences
perfection through assimilation 
1 gender, 1 race, 1 sexuality
i see a future where there is only 1 gender
also did you hear how they fertilized an egg with the woman's own sperm generated through her cells in some way
whyd you buy urfwick
same
4head
just be better
so let them win
dumbass poor people keep voting against their interest
also idk why youd want to help people who wont help themselves
we should send the poor people to the center and then secede
only 10 states pay for the nation
honestly i just want california to be independent so we stop supporting the shithole states
xd
or youre gay
so either you help others because the govt forces you
nothings changed
i mean...yea
and need order
yea but some of these poverty ass redneck kids have too much freedom
no reason to waste capable people's time with it
imo it gives loser kids purpose but if youre going to college or have a job you should be exempt
lmao theres already some high schools where your graduation req is sa job offer, a college admission, or joining the military
my dude too fucking bitchmade to run or win
but hes def a bottom
idk his actual policies
true
xd
unviable has a double meaning
did you know pete is gay
?
gamer hours
riot liked it so much that they gave me a key fragment for being so honorable
you guys remember how i told someone in league &quot;i hope a family member of yours commits suicide&quot; 
as is tradition with nintendo IP
Yea 
SCP 42069 - Chad
is he the one who let us into davids building
also men who were pissing him off
thats the real power play
LBJ used to whip his dick out on women
talking is distracting typing is ok
cant
im studying for the amazon final round
its just how it is
see the problem is dating white women
i was so much happier
then when i just accepted it
i spent my whole teenage times trying to be different and thinking how to not conform
thats where you find fulfillment and content
learning to conform is the most important lesson in life
trying to be different and unique is the source of discontent
or just...conform and be happy
again why dont you want to just take the easy route to a fulfilling and comfortable life
its satisfying, its easy, its profitable
yea but why dont you want to do one of the big 3
self driving AI, workload automation, etc
like connecting africa via internet or sending rockets into space
if youre after personal satisfaction a lot of tech companies are out there doing good things for people
this is a good life to get into
and their campus is way cooler than anything youll find outside tech
for even junior devs
unlimited paid time off
google literally has massages on demand
plus you work in cool offices with cool people
you put in half-time work to get an education for like 5x the pay
total
its like 20 hours a week
and dnd shit
look how much league i play with you guys
its not that hard
easy bank
or go into medicine/law
milo youre smart do stem
kinda dog
which yea
90k is like 44/hr
total comp
~90k
both are kinda shit pay actually
they do mostly sensor systems
like the curiosity on mars
another is for exploration rovers
one is for rocket system automation
ive got interviews with like 2 rocket companies doing some really cool shit. that field is sick
anything really
aerospace
industrial
biomedical engineering
and seeing yourself succeed 
it feels good chasing a goal
pursue something greater milo
xd
i dont like this
when did i become not the edgiest one
ok well youre lonely. SAD
or seen someone in class or whatever and wanted to ask them out
what youve never fucked a girl you want to go back out with
yea
why not
fuck you 2 then
im gonna cop an idea
for v day
you guys doing anything
and i aint a housewife
thats a bitch move cause then youre cooking alone
so i need ideas of places to check
but everything is full
yes
yea. theyre also full
im the one who got played
nah they've taken us to similar places
rn
im fucked
YEA I DID
or i got powerplayed on
so i gotta match that
her mom took us for like 1500$ steak
i was thinking more expensive than that
and theyre all full
melisse only has 8 tables after the renovation
btw anyone have valentines day ideas
so you dont want a prenup
marry a girl richer than you
imagine having to put effort into your sex life omegalul
its more hassle than just getting her to suck your dick or ride you when you feel like it
and you have to install like a foot placer thing
you cant fuck in the shower anyway youll slip and die
mine is hot-&gt;smart-&gt;rich-&gt;shorter than you-&gt;not loud
whats your ordering
the checklist in order of most to least important
lmao
just green card marriage a bitch
yea but like you got options too milo
and what kinds of children are acceptable
when it comes to who should date who
shes more conservative than me by a lot
i havent said anything shed be against tho
lmao she might read this
or pushy
and not too loud
obviously hot
smart
rich
perfect girl is like close to your height but shorter
just talking about like straight relationships
idk how shit works for non-straight people and im not looking to
doesnt matter if theyre short
yea exactly so fuck whoever
otherwise she looks like shes dominant
why would you not want to be taller than your girl
idk i dont wanna get disowned so i dont bother with non asian/white
doesnt mean it didnt suck tho
ig
still traumatized
worst gf ever was faith
like 2 and it SUCKED
unlike fuckin shannen or smth idk
and i never worried about them talking shit about me or accusing me of shit
never needed to with valerie or rachel or whatever
and all that shit
and like pretend to care about their opinions about politics
i had to do shit they wanted
nah but like remember when i went out with white girls in highscool
they just do what you want and your life is easy
its not in the culture
thats what we're avoiding here by saying go for ethnic girls
mars german girls have this idea of like feminism and metoo xd
because asian girls are the best. dating white women was a mistake
also she like listens to him too
im assuming she has options tho
and supportive
and is super chill with him about it
dating a guy working uniqlo
shes a ucla biology graduate
look at diego and his girl
so therefore reasonable
yea bitch go date some asian chick. theyre usually smart and obedient
straight up its like the 1920s
so its safe
feminism isnt a thing in asia yet
just date an asian girl
i want humanity to continue with the best people possible
because its progress
because otherwise the world is populated with the shit genes of indian or african povery ass bitches
i see it as a disservice to humanity not passing on your genes
ig 
its someone elses genes
or like theyll be adopted at which point it isnt your kids anyway
they wont have kids then
thats all it needs to be
just have 2 normal kids. 1 son, 1 daughter. intelligent, attractive, straight, black hair and eyes
tbh tho by the time we want kids the tech will be out to select their genes
thats how humanity improves
thats how progress grows at an exponential rate
that can contribute more than you ever did
your genes have so much potential and are so far above average youre doing a disservice to humanity by not providing 2 normal kids
yea but would you want a kid that isnt normal
cant keep it
you konw
im not my parents so i wouldnt drop them in a ditch but
itd be bad
and start over again
no having an autistic kid would be a disaster. its a year of pregnancy wasted and now you have to give them up
both completely normal and intelligent
mars my family is going to have 2 kids
im pretty sure my parents wouldve ditched me in a dumpster at the first sign of problems
when you can have another and train them
idk why youd support an autistic child
but if you didnt then work for it
some people luck into it
because everyone can work hard enough to get here
yes. so im gonna make sure my kid works hard enough they dont need to be
and i got lucky i ended up here
i wasted so much fucking time after school playing league and shit
to expose even more potential
i know exactly how to push a kid like me
id be a great father
those with potential
you need to be realistic and support those who deserve it
idk. if he kept with them our family would have nothing
1 child failing is just unlucky
failing as a parent is having no children succeed
i have no qualms cutting off 1 son
gwyn my grandpa cut off like 12 of his siblings because they amounted to nothing
im not leaving this world with my heir an incompetent
id just have another
not my son
yes
because theyre failures
if they fail to do so they dont deserve anything
they exist to build a better one for their kids
if they fail they dont deserve a better world
because they know they can afford to
id rather them fail than have no ambition and never seek anything
id rather teach my children to be strong than build them a net
you have the pride and satisfaction and your children have a nicer world
thats what counts
this progress amounts to better lives for your children
refusing to work toward it is selfish
your time on this world is cosmic nothing. your only meaning is to be part of greater progress
instead of working towards long term progress
cause people here want to be lazy and enjoy their time
again why do you think every other country is progressing faster than us
thats lazy shit
and be the fucking best at their specialty 
thats part of the fun tho
everyone should grind to know the most they can
only shitty coworkers or low level managers
of everyone ive met nobody has had a bad boss
except shitty little local ones
thats like all companies tho
so now he just manages shit because they can trust him to understand all the technical details and problems
to l7
and so they promoted him
anyway hes just a fucking genius
half cousin
i mean ones my cousin and he's always been chill
and knowing the full tech stack
nah you get there by being really fucking good at what you do
your general managers and executives are pretty cool people
i genuinely dont. the worst people to deal with are team managers and low level production people
i dont see how being successful means youre high strung
because failure is an option
safety nets make us weaker overall
and those who fail end up on the pile of bodies to be climbed over
personally id rather live in a world where everyone is gunning for the top
same with like google execs and shit
like all the professors with decades of tenure and research dont give a fuck cause they know theyre untouchable
have you worked with people who are genuinely top of their field. theyre kinda laid back
damn TIL
arent at the top
yes mars C level execs
drink a lot of wine and work just enough
and theyre all pretty chill
ik a lot of people at like c level tech or other business
idk i dont think most peoples egos are that large
self improvement and results
thats literally the fun part
why would you pursue a life thats not at the top
or with the potential to be
nerfing the people at the top only makes sense if you dont think of yourself at someone at the top
so everyones on an equal floor regardless of capability
while we're at it
lets buff annie until shes top tier
good idea
yea nerf the people for playing well
and you should learn a useful skill
if you dont have the capacity to be needed by those at the top then youre a bitch at the bottom of the totem pole
which is the real ideal
but thats just companies and unchecked capitalism
the problem is obviously rat fuckers who group up to cover their own weakness
theres a certain appeal to the idea of living or dying on your own personal capability
otherwise that time was a waste
i got suckered into scouts for 5 years so i want to be forced to need basic survival skills
im ready for the anarchy
im capable and smart as fuck so ill be fine
no govt no tax bb
duh
bc w/ no government companies can pay me that much more
come with me and just stay there
ay im going to new zealand for spring break
mars i cant tell wtf you want
this is just shooting yourself in the foot
youre also studying data science which is the industry thats gonna get fucked by bernie
and youre employed
you live in a nice place
just measure how your life is going
unless youre bill gates you can always look at your neighbor and be like &quot;hes rich, im poor&quot;
you always think youre poor no matter where you are
social liberal economic conservative<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1580866268009" ts="1580866268" t="61"></e_m>
social liberal economic conservative<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1580866268009" ts="1580866268" t="61"></e_m>
yea but she had good policies
cause they all suckk
except the fact she was kind of a bitch
i like hilary's policy
im registered for nobody
you get money for college already
you think bernies gonna give you money
whats wrong with life rn
why risk it
itll be decades before youre affected
and life is good
rn the course is good
why do you want to risk your life changing for the worse
everyone else keeps life nice and good
fuck him i dont want change
except bernie
who cares who wins
look what i found
Xd 
So bless trump boys 
That's good policy
Like Christina's internship place is pretty much brand new and already worth billions. Like just their staffing cost is 2 billion a year. Which is like 15k good jobs
By not taxing shit he enables these companies to expand a bunch
which is doing smth
he changed the course tech wouldve taken
inaction is a form of action
him being too incompetent to make change has been doing good
like obama or hillary would have
not going after big tech
nah trump has done a lot
so ig hes just the best leader
weirdly enough the trump years have been the best of my life tho
im not the most affected by politics but ik during obama things got better
id take some dead terrorists for that if he didnt hate gamers
still riding the high off that one
good economy tho
like whos running to just keep life the same as it is
whos even neutral this election
people would just think change occurred
yea. i dont think anything would really change
ig
for the people actually affected by politics
so he'd be worse than trump
see pence is legitimately smart
so theyd poison a candidate
people fear change and the future though
life isnt even that bad right now that people would risk that play
yea exactly
or some shit
cause they slipped him polonium
is bernies dumb old ass is gonna have a heart attack
the real play
hes a red herring sent to disrupt the democrats by the republicans clearly
sure. thats a fair point
they have way better methods to cheat in way more crucial moments
you dont get caught cheating and do the same move again
and its the same exact move
cause everyone sees it
but this isnt how theyre gonna cheat right
yea true
the simplest one is literally no budget to build an app
theres so many simple reasons for this
to be anything but regular incompetence
i feel like this is too shitty of an attempt
maybe
when the truth is like 5-15
instead of just saying &quot;i had 10k, he only had 9&quot;
why make it break
right but if you were going to make this app to count caucus members
if youre going to cheat why cheat so obviously
is the worst move
making it not work and look shady as fuck
to display to everyone his victory
if there was a conspiracy why wouldnt he rig the app
paid by the govt
but it is a private company
i thought it was private company
is Shadow govt
so just regular old fraud
or renegotiating
literally going and forging contracts
what do you mean rewriting
this involves too many people to be conspiracy imo
NSA spying and shit
think of all the secret government plans leaked with far less people involved
rather than everyone who worked on it being paid off
yea but that just sounds like incompetence 
everyone else can see and pull it 
at any level if you push something broken
database code has to be written
development literally doesnt work like that. people have to test
their app was being built to fail
every employee of the company would know
that thousands involved all said nothing
is far more likely than corruption on a level so deep
government incompetence
the simplest answer is usually the right one
idk. occam's razor right
its just incompetent as fuck 
i mean to build that app they would need easily millions
i dont blame them
but if they were only paid that much
thats shady yea
with another 50k youre looking at the budget it takes to make the devs go to work one day
i mean it says the DNC paid about 63k
nah even if you were a real company 100k couldnt build shit
he spent just enough money to make a UI and push it to the store with some basic functions
thats like 100 dev hours. its 100% intentional it didnt work
no wonder it failed
wait they only had 100k to make an app
thats a power play right there
Why can't you fucks pick soraka top for me every game so I can ignore that lane 
Jg is ruined. Top lane matters in soloq but not in pro
Isn't he twitch banned
But who jgs cait 
Damn. I figured it's an adc
I assume he's playing vayne or graves
but you should do it
you wont get the money back
do it
i think theyre just stupid
The men have no excuse
but at least thats ok
theres a girl who comes sometimes
making me actually work
struggling with basic programming
its consistently the same retards week after week
the wrong half ig
ruining my paid time off
why tf are these people here
i never went for help
the zoomers are doomed 
i swear when i learned it this wasnt that hard
oh god
hes back
thats not my job
like fuck your dumb foreign ass learn to read english
and ive gotten 5 people asking me how &amp; and * work or &quot;what do these instructions mean&quot;
the thing that tilts me is this shit is all freshman level
its really easy. every char is 1 byte. if i want to read the Nth letter of string all i do is read(string+N)
ok so if you have a string which is just a collection of characters and youre reading through 1 by 1 in a separate thing he's asking how do we tell it to read the next char instead of the string head
300 level course btw
&quot;how do i track the character I last read in a string when I call read so I can read the next one&quot;
fucking kms
theres this dumbass stoned looking kid who keeps asking me to clarify the lab instructions
and that restored my mental
im stuck in lab answering dumbass algorithm questions
tru
you wanna be back?
i didnt put you back?
listen to this fire
a bunch of roided up chads rampaging through a country is how you make sure they lost
the goal is never just to win, its to make sure they lose
if they int they int
thats fine. the goal is maximum carnage anyway
After an invasion they'll have a generation of half American bastards 
See that's what I'm saying. We need to not do that shit. Give them Viagra every meal so they're total chad and literally fuck the shit out of any bitches we invade
getting fucked is bad. doing the fucking is good. we just need to have chad training for the military
is your problem with him that he's swedish or that hes a fuck
because thats what warfare was according to blizz
you cant say that just cause theyre both brown
how tho
is he vegan
its unfortunately their right to be a bitch boy
the thing about full simulated virtual reality is that its private property. its like being in someone's house right. they can say youre not allowed to drop n bombs or youre asked to leave without violating any rights
kkona
obviously
i have the right to call people racial slurs
YES
theyre nothing but animals
dismantled their academic institutions and lost their own culture
they abandoned their emperor and turned against the dynasty as it was fighting japan. literally backstabbed their ruler
those people deserve their shitty government and the things it does to them
that fuck themselves
its entirely the people of china
taiwan has more chinese culture than china and they managed to build up a first world country with a functioning government, prosperity, and decent quality of life
all aspects of chinese culture right now are what the government instilled after the revolution. its what the people built themselves
the ccp dismantled confucious, ancestor worship, buddhism, literacy, etc
you understand there is no chinese culture any more
its entirely on them
the people chose to give up their rights in exchange for security and foo
and capable
i dont care for their government at all but theyre intelligent
you just keep them in line
youd never help them
the people in china are the fucking worst 
if you look at china's history its always peasant uprisings that bring down the government so if youre a smart leader you just have to keep them happy
they can subjugate the population and stay in power
their play is just to gather enough power and money in the government that when things fall apart
their gdp is a bubble on empty houses
thats literally what they did
and they can report a growth of gdp
but the people are placated for a while
and the money ends up back in the govts hands anyway
and so they used money to build these cities 
there were too many people out of work right
they used ghost cities to make jobs milo
they built them knowing theyd be empty
and drawing foreign investment
the ghost cities stimulate their economy by moving money out of the government
it hasnt escaped or really fucked any other populace
the deaths of a bunch of chinese peasant farmers is a good thing though
theyre making big plays here
actually it has the added benefit of potentially weakening other countries too
now they have a cheap solution
idk i think its a good choice. the ghost cities generate money while the people dont
not like they dont deserve it either so its karma
its a practical plan though. the world wont let you kill them so you just allow disease to
you call it inability. i see it as refusal
thats why they arent dealing with it
lets be real they wanted the plague to deal with the peasant infestation
ngl
league stone looks pretty good
i always knew we were overdue for a plague
chinese new year incoming this weekend too
fuck is dicksword
the auth right loves crocs tho cause thats what they aspire to do
least favorite animals
are you tilted yet
jett put champions in there so i can draw titties
what happened to kobe
fair that game is overpriced
overcooked
or if you really wanna goon
scribblio
so youre saying he does think people should be in jail for color
d
x
those are the real key issues
hes not a gamer tho
fuck this man. rather have trump
joe biden hates GAMERS
or can you play it now
is it still in beta
xd
escape from tarkov?
rate out of 10
or smth more scuffed like overcooked and duck game
anyone league or scribblio
cause cig smokers are gonna die soon so theyre preparing you
good game
yes
risk of rain
<at id="8:mars.speaks">Ride</at> <at id="8:live:jettamoore_1">Jett</at> <at id="8:parsa.jourx">Parsa</at> risk of rain?
ill hit you up later
for now
scuffed
cant invite cause riot servers
chats broken anyway
hows he still on break
by playing league
anyone want to make me more of a doomer
milo you fall asleep so fast cause you operate at 10% by the time you sleep
holding smth definitely speeds it up
i slept worse before christina basically mmoved in
unlucky you
ah ok. i get straight hours
like imagining whats happening on a chess board or hearthstone game
weirdly card games are really good cause i can burn out my energy tracking the game on sounds alone
closer to 2 hours without
ike a youtube video
i think i average closer to 30 min if i listen to smth in the background
anyway. jett how long do you take to sleep
will it fit the spaghet
or are they normal size
did they shrink
why sleep if no tire
really milo is just 50/50 up or down
or slightly sick milo
or tired milo
not like milo on pizza
i function pretty much the same all day
comp-bed is usually longer
depending on what im thinking about as im falling asleep
but it takes like anywhere between 30-3 hours to sleep
im like comp-watch videos and cuddle-fuck-bed
i use flux so the light isnt bad
rn
im like 2 hours to sleep
most of you are white so you should have less shit to worry about
life is chill and good. shits easy so take it easy
be chill
lifes chill
without drugs
fuck is wrong with your brain that you cant be happy and stressless
but if you cant handle your life sober your life sucks
its the boomer age catching up
the older i get the more sober i like to be
you bitches are just edgy
i like my life enough to like it sober
experience sharper
remember more
youre keener
sober is nice
my mind does
ye but you have to look at it
unless shes hot
you cant get into the frame of mind to nut
imo nah
if shes not technique doesnt matter
its easy
if shes hot and on your dick
find better girls ig
shits usually good
i hthink i get there 9/10
damn
you only came once
and usually theyre hot enough they dont have to know how
like 1/5 cant
but like. most girls can
who are you fucking that cant suck a dick
clever
good pun
giving is meh
getting head is fun
bad
nightmare
loser
gross
mars you eat out
again find a better girl if she smells damn
and thats what matters
girls smell good
idk
fuck classier girls
..
ideal ratio is like 20:1. just an every now and then thing
and waiting for you
and thats a lot of prep for her
if you do anal you have to deal with the shit
why bother with anything else
its special made for dick
pussy is just tight
idk i never fucked any girl whos ass was significantly tighter
and you have so much more to deal with
in a significant way
its really not tighter
self cleans
self lubes
listen pussy is less work
and even then its probably worse
the only time to do it in the ass is on her period
gross
thats a galaxy brain move
to lubricate with what used to be seminal fluid
but like what if you could rewire a post op vagina
and men can produce vaginal fluid naturally
cause they dont really go inside you and replace your internals right
or like seminal fluid
with cum
do post op vaginas self lubricate
than anything else imaginable
which is worse
theres people into actual shit
ig
people are into weird shit
right there on the sidewalk
would get off on it
where if they got jumped
ok so youre saying theres someone out there
as getting off on assault
yea but what im saying is theres no such kink
getting hit in the butt != getting gut punched
and getting of on someone straight jumping you
i feel like theres a difference between liking slapping
milo has waluigi energy
kinkshaming is fine
with his noodle arms
i think milo could legit jump you
do you actually enjoy getting beaten up tho
if you think aboutit
testosterone is just steroids
i really doubt it
pay per view bitch
paypal me 5$ for the livestream link
its gonna happen
milo will defeat gwyn
doesnt need to care about life
shes in the optimal demographic
which is weird
she actually cares about others
the shit we dont agree on is like how much people matter
how do i mute her
ok gwyn doesnt know what shes saying
what else could you want
i already dont call people niggers unironicaly
im just also usually irght
milo i listen to her
they are truly a mystery
who knows what women want
and she doesnt see it
her parents would take her in if she shot someone
we just argue about being chill or not
and theyd take her in
she could show up on crack
theyre parents. no matter what theyll love you and support you
idk how
while i just dont give a fuck. i need to teach her how to but
she cares a lot about how her parents think of her
yea thats the other thing
whats gonna happen really
ok but short of her getting addicted to fucking crack
and i try to convince her of it but idk. it isnt working
i just assume everything will work out
not finding a job, saving for retirement, classes, etc
and worries about life
which is why im amazed she gets so stressed about things
so were kinda even
but i spend less
ive got like 50 on me
like makeup and shit
shes only got like 10k in the bank cause she buys a lot of stuff
her parents earn more but her grandparents have nothing
on hand nah
define immediate
so much
but she stresses about shit
i keep trying to tell her life is easy and we're chilling
but her worldview is darker
in some ways
cause christina hates it
in 12 months
i actually dont think ive said it outside league and your dumbass scribblio
are

bitch youre older than me
therefore i hate other people
i like things staying as they are
and i hate change
and change my life plan
and my satisfaction
because everyone wants to take away my happiness
bleak
view of the world and people
my view of my life is bright
so long
it comes from being parsas friend
im just naturally edgy
why risk it
shits chill
life is great
you guys have bleak ass world views
im not suicidal at least
jesus fuck
does anyone NOT have mental health problems
first mars now gwyn
as soon as im out of class
no fuck you im gonna que
and south ameria
you mean africa
and made me a doomer 
you played league with me
you guys made me think that not all people are great
its you guys that changed my mind anyway
and a lot of his shit isnt peer reviewed
i have but that guy is a crackpot
or make way
instead, i think now only certain people are great and others should serve them
south asia wouldnt be so shit
greatness cant be in all people because otherwise africa and south america would have great people
after so much self debilitation
look at the history of the world. asia and europe constantly fought themselves and set themselves back time and time again. only to conquer the world
i think now that only certain people have potential
youve changed my mind
anyway ive gone back on that thought
mute retard
good != excellent
and i think excellence may even be more common in certain people
i dont think all people have excellence
all of southeast asia constantly self debilitating
if thats true why are there countries in africa with centuries of poverty and turmoil
its not even a hard game to complete. just one that has a lot of bonus objectives
thats how games are designed
if life is a single player you can always win
and got rich
there are poor people who invented something
or at least competent
choose to be excellent
and have the money to do so
then they should excel at their work
if your culture lets you turn away family then solve that first
thats a cultural issue
id count on familial support over country
i dont particularly like annie but ive supported her anyway
who turns away family
we'd gain nothin
friends and family already are your net
that covers such things
youre in position to have a job
and in return we pay higher tax
we gain nothing
at our loss
which makes no sense
it is because youre saying we should vote against ourselves
e.g. 1 american child vs a kenyan one
matter more than those who arent like you
people you know and are similar to
i hope you guys would do the same
if it meant you guys live
listen i'd genocide all of like kenya or smth
or friends
why make millions better if the thousands are your family
1 to 1
but if its numbers how are you valuing your children vs some strangers
your and your own vs the world
probably more accurate
single family game
you deserve it
if you lose to the AI
single player game
until the weak are strong enough to stop them
the strong should be able to do what they want
i get your point. i dont agree
I support healthcare obviously
Ok but we don't need them then. The sick can heal but the weak can't
Who can't
Unless you're a native held at gunpoint on your reservation you can direct your life 
Animals can't
Humans have the ability to act and change their circumstance
Than lowlifes
They're more valuable abd rare
To kill Milo
Jett you're gonna need form 115b
Without the right permit 
Also true. Slaughter of animals is illegal
Why not
Made their actions legal again 
Doing unethical shit like Amazon is ok because they paid their fine
But there's no moral Obligation to do so 
If the laws change to make the taxation ok then fine
Because it has to come at some cost. As of the laws now nothing done was illegal
Even if it's hard it's on the individual to grab it
And again the ability to rise still exists
More are rising from poverty than falling
It still exists tho. Millions are now middle class in China when their parents had nothing
The system is flawed
That's ok. But if they make it so there's no hope
If there's a possibility and you don't make it
But it is possible to rise. That's what I think is the key
Fucking phone
Their
Forcing the rich to give up they're money is no different
It sucks
So you see what I'm saying. When others force a choice on you
But it's not one I agree with and not one we should force on the rich
So if she chooses to you should have the money to never work. She's made her choice then
I think you could find out 
Most families track it at least 10 generations
You should be
Main line. First son then yea
If you're of his direct descent yea
And those who have
We should keep only the successful
I don't see him as a necessity
He consumes but does not produce. His bloodline hasn't contributed enough to earn him a life
Contributes nothing<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1579212880529" ts="1579212880" t="61"></e_m>
Contributes nothing<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1579212880529" ts="1579212880" t="61"></e_m>
The homeless man on the beach
Those people have done what to earn it tho
Because he's contributed so much it covers their obligation
That they don't have to work
And again that's the right of the successful one to make sure his kids can do that
It does tho. Inheritance/gift kicks in at 22 mil
The single player decided for all the others
The one who made the fortune wanted it to descend to his next incarnations
To let his children ride his greatness
But the one who created it has the right
But to generate billions that family had to create something
Not my problem
Not my family
Not my friends
If you want to call it that. Yea
Rather than containing success to you and your own
But that also uplifts many who didn't earn it or work for it 
Just have more kids
Idc how terrible they are
They're alive tho. If they live and are happy
Difference of opinion ig
So I don't fault them for doing the same
But in my view I'd destroy those millions to ensure the lives of just a dozen of my descendants
Fair
Why give up your future generations safety net
But what if their kids weren't. They'd have no fortune to turn to
Ik. Again the middle class kids were ok
If you hoard the money they'll always be fine
But they exposed the possibility the grand children weren't
Yea the first kids were fine
Two generations down. Their kids were vulnerable again
There's so many families where the parents donated their fortune and the kids eventually had no savings. Just a middle class life 
What if helping those alive means your kids starve
The existence of billionaires isn't doing you direct harm. The secret police don't knock on your door and beat you up because besos is alive
To care for their kids
It'd go to my parents or sister
And that's what matters
Because they'll have my blood
Family first
They're my kin
I care more for them tho
I don't need it. Maybe my children are weak. My strength should carry them through life tho
To give my children the choice to have it
Dual income etc
Gonna do what I said. Middle class live with a stable job
I mean I wasn't planning on living off if either
Why didn't they bounce back up
They haven't earned it in any way tho
You don't have to fix a problem that will fix itself
Why support them when you can let then die out 
Nothing wrong with the country actually affects me
Nothing wrong with the country actually affects me
Not really
Not my ills 
It's the finger pointing
But no meme I just hate the poor more than I love the rich. Blaming others for your ills is a cardinal sin
Xd
I get an inheritance of about a bil. Ntd tho
lowballing wages is not a crime
i really dont think all billionaires committed crimes
success doesnt make you a villain
tax loopholes or whatever are part of the system
as it is, the money they earned is legal
criminality is taking from others in illegal ways
they played the system well
doesnt give others the right to take it from you
if youre successful just because youd live with less
yea but thats not justice to take from those just because they can afford to lose
we arent really at the point where life is so disgustingly difficult that it cant be overcome
to deal with challenges faced
i trust that those i acquaint with are capable enough
or get better and clear them out
move servers
not your guild. not your problem
everything about you is the stuff that matters
milo life is a single player
the problem is the ones who arent capable and who choose cultures that dont support each other
those people arent you tho because youre capable
oh well
you shell out a little more ore their college
stable career, happy marriage, kid or two
if you live out a middle class life youre not going to be affected by crippling poverty
for people who arent like you
why champion a cause that isnt affecting you
or just live your life knowing theyll never get to you
and take advantage of it
then get better at the game
you have to crush the competition
to stay on top
thats the point
imagine trying to nerf people for playing well
and reap the rewards of your effort
its not some foreign concept to start a big company and build it up
or just work harder and be rich
thats it
you get fined
its stupid
i got all 3 of these on 1 page<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1579210773937" ts="1579210773" t="61"></e_m>

theres constantly marxist/socialist bs on the front page or memes about how school is too hard
unironically. people who post shit supporting socialism or education reform or whatever on reddit are the fucking worst
just be successful 4head
poor people xc
gives them hope theyll one day be real humans too
theyre just sad people with no prospects and no talents so seeing someone like them do ok
even when it puts out shitty songs
and like the monkeys they are, they flock behind the brightest, most decorated one
mexicans and blacks particularly
listen, there are a lot of minorities out there
she just looks fat
agree
not china
thats for mexican pleasing
wait milo she has curly whiteish hair
theres a lot of problems
personality
voice
hair, skin, body shape
id be happy not seeing her ratchet ass again
good
nerf pls
too dark 4 me
gotta ban qiyana too now
only with the release skin
gragas karma 
sorry, cant do it, i dont have enough bans for all ekko lucian senna
guantanamo bay is just summer camp for you huh
the one black kid in 3h was the fucking orphan janitor
no minorities
its always just young attractive white/asian characters with dark hair unless female
because they aren't inclusive
the anime takeover is a good thing
but think of it this way
smash is only one in a long line of things waiting to fall
and you need to accept that
your life is slowly being taken over by anime
theyll be happy to hear you out in interrogation room C
tell that to border control rn
at least if i leave the country theyll let me back in
that makes the game so bad
its shit like donkey kong, ganon, olimar
im all in for a weeb smash
c u l t u r e
culture
ah yes
youre into some weird shit
i saw that
ok milo
and weebs actually have money
but now they get the weeb money
such a good decision by nitendo tho. all the sweaty fucks already got the pass and will keep getting it cause theyre tryhard sweats playing a kids game competitively right
sothis is better than them by a lot
d tier is also that edgy bitch who gets killed by the old guy
nah d tier is shit like catherine
which makes it that much worse
sothis is like a b tier waifu
im with it
hahahhah its so fucking dumb
nah i didnt watch it at all
jett and mars are the sweaties keeping us away from this grand goal
xd
2d sword fighter game
just hp

way better. actually playable
next smash is just all 3h students
until the game is just fire emblem the fighting game
buff all FE characters
but im buying their dlc
i didnt even buy their game
released a dlc ill actually get
gj nintendo
as if nintendo cares what broke ass redditors care about
saying they want some non anime third party bs
my favorite thing ever is all the sweaty fucks complaining about byleth
but idk if ill play
probably gonna get it anyway
yea but its edgy house
not to play it
so they make more
listen, im just gonna buy the byleth dlc
gameplay is ass
no
dont even play the game
easy buy
OH FUCK
nintendo when

he got fired anyway
nut
edelyth

wheres the costume list
you the gayest man to ever live
if u use male byleth

anyone lookin for gamer hours

i thought it was a place
oh its a drug
ayahuasca?
I just passed Andy milonaukus or whatever the fuck streaming in little Tokyo

Lux R: heal all your boys and summon a galio to join your team after afking 2 minutes
Her what now
Damn they're all the same height and weight
One of them is the guy that tackled the freljordian to get lux her staff back
New kaisa buff. Q missiles are aoe on hit
She's probably all void teeth and mucus down there 
It's just the helmet that retracts
How's he gonna do that tho. Does the void skin conveniently not cover her pussy
Wait when ez looks like he's gonna fuck kaisa
It's better than his rework
About why he's with a bunch of mini trynds
Did you guys ever read the sylas story they posted
This time
Why'd they reuse warriors
She looked anime as fuck
Bitch her eyes were too big
Yea but that's why we need a second chance
Last year's video was sick
Me want more irelia
Cooling on that bitch tho now that they keep including thicc women like irelia and kaisa
Lux was best girl
Cait looking cute too without the hat
Lux meh 
I'd clap kaisas void infested ass any day
Sylas looks like a hipster
So yea. Technically Canadians but just as scuffed
So basically everyone on it was Iranian ethnicity
The plane was leaving from their own airport 
Iranian descent Canadians
That's even more scuffed than I thought it could be
147/165 citizens on the jet Iran shot down were Iranians
I do not.
he was still meeting with the fucker who led an attack on the US embassy
not counting all the shady shit and people he killed over the years which is like 600
and they should see that
i mean the general had it coming
ngl thats a fucking smooth brain move
also iran hit a ukrainian jet<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1578607505839" ts="1578607505" t="61"></e_m>

Did you guys know that Indian housewives own 11% of the world's gold. More than major banks and Switzerland
League in 2020
because im too boomer to be the lobster
i will be the human in that pic
government pays way higher than private during war
think of the money you can make tho
im glad thats the state of the world rn
i like that lobster fight meme
hes too boomer to fly
milo cant see shit
so they dont want to draft you
or just have a useful skill
can just fail the fitnesst est
realistically she's just too old
tru
they wont call on you because they have 1.4 million dumb kids who went into it for free college
also youre too old to need to draft dodge
thats a case study in how to do it with last decade's resources
and supression
like if the goal is division
and also the cutting edge AI we have
and they lack the computational power that the US has
look at how well china does it with the uighyurs
youd be surprised
live object segmentation
gait recognition
tbh some of the stuff is really cool tho
so im building his shit if it comes down to it
but trump will pay me more
both did shitty things
idc either way
side with whoever cuts you a better paycheck
these are opportunities
or the continued class divide due to automation
like a class war breaking out
war is even an opportunity for you to get rich
nothing
what will a war breaking out do to YOU
what is iran going to do to YOU
to you personally
the fuck is iran going to do about it
clearly
mars is impotent
sterile or impotent
might as well say heart attack
autopilot
at worst itll affect our kids
like there arent actually issues that stand a chance of fucking us up
if war breaks out we're on the winning side
and some humans will have settled another planet
by the time the planet is uninhabitable we'll be dead
so who cares
were fine
yea but if humans fight among themselves
and exterminate humanity for the greater good
its only a matter of time before cyborgs rise up
once someone builds the means to digitize consciousness
thats why i want to work for a contractor
theyll be used eventually
heres the thing though. if we build the tools
I just want to make sure we win
also mars i dont need to justify genocide. its already happening
cause i can just send you an amazon basics shit one
milo is your keyboard just the laptop one
But itâ€™s dank
I know itâ€™s wrong
I just want genocide
Idc about moral right or wrong
Legit my new goal in life is to go work for a military contractor in the upcoming ww3
See the more people alive the more inconsistency and the more competetion. Like Milo and his autism keyboard
Over all other things
Knowing youâ€™ve won
The fun comes from being the last thing in existence
Wtf is evangelion
Fuck people
An eternity of nothing but me. Perfect
My consciousness will be the core of the network
Because Iâ€™ll be everything
No emotions or randomness
Iâ€™d create a universe of permanent and perfect efficiency 
All the vindictiveness and shit
Yes. And being a god would be great
Then wipe them out again
Find the old ruins and realize
Wipe out humans just to recreate them and let them explore
Youâ€™re a machine. Sleep cycle till itâ€™s done or find a way to speed it up
For the thrill of exterminating them
You could even create new sentience to rival you
The thing about infinity is it never runs out. If you seeded the universe to your will youâ€™d never grow tired
Is nut
An eternity of control and superiority
And build new ones
Then we wipe them clean too
Less worthless life forms than the general human
Yes. Other planets. Other life
The bounds of what is possible
The edges of the universe
Cosmic truths
Only knowledge
No errors or emotions based on flesh
And improve efficiency
Use all the new processing power and intellect to cleanse flesh based humanity
And wipe them out
Fuck no. Iâ€™d cyborg myself then lead machines against humans
It wouldnâ€™t matter what they think of your appearance 
Youâ€™d be so superior to anyone that isnâ€™t a machine
Even if I couldnâ€™t Iâ€™d probably still do it
The only thing Iâ€™m attached to in my body is the look. If I could replace all the internals with machinery thatâ€™s a no brainer
You have all the time in the universe to study and learn everything there is
But why would you ever want to
You're still a machine you can choose to die
Itâ€™s such a sick idea
You can work on your ideas forever
No sleep. No wasted efficiency
So you guys wouldnâ€™t take the chance to be an immortal and painless machine body 
Because brain cells replace a lot less often
Ship of theseus
And if I get corrupted I just hop to the next one
I assume the body comes with an internal generator
Iâ€™m in it
As long as I can still fuck
No weakness. No hunger. No pain
Fuck this flesh bullshit
God damn I'm ready to transfer my consciousness but to a mechanical body
Also with a trillion dollars in shady govt projects there's bound to be some hidden shit to give us warning or intercept. Those missiles have to run specific electronics and communicate with specific satellites
You assume iran can fire smth a redneck with a Beretta couldn't gun down
you probably have to worry about lone incels here tho
with missiles at least
im pretty sure its worse to be in bumfuck nowhere cause theyre not dumb enough to go for big well-defended cities
imagine fortnite kids building you out then dancing on your corpse
you ever think about the impending war and how we'll be sending zoomers in
also same. there really are just random internet hoes calling strangers thicc on league
that counts tho
but good for you
ngl i was talking to the boys
You ever been called thicc
Smart move admitting it on Skype lol 
Smart move admitting it on Skype lol 
Mars you're black and broke a law
Bitch what
They have to deem you less valuable outside the military
I think I signed up idk. Chance they draft me is low af anyway
it's ok were too old anyway 
OOF GET FUCKED
Have fun fucker
Also the only one getting drafted is jett. They start with 18 yr old and move up
I fucking love that we droned him. That's a power play
big dick escalation moves
you guys hear trump assassinated an iranian general in retaliation for associating with a guy that killed an american contractor
Oof
I'm not back until next Thursday
but point taken
idk about you but i dont plan on getting evicted nigga

ik you read patch notes and shit but
besides worlds i guess
i like the game but i dont watch shit about it
you could just say fuck the content
xd
yea its our only social gathering
Zoomers are on it all day
That's a boomer move tho
ðŸ‘Œ
fucking lizard people trying to blend in
one of the dentists i went to was a sketchy fuck like this
google just says that no one likes you
shouldve asked him if his flash is up
every day we stray further from gods light
degeneracy yes
bastard
im grossed out now
well it worked
they go hard
or at least cause permanent damage
might just kill you
yea 20 of the first
or the bdsm weirdo type lashes
is this like the hong kong corporal punishment lashes
in his life
mars has never read
whered you sleep tf
anyone wanna play league or risk of rain
just wotlk to 50 and never touch cata or draenor
this is pog tho
and the most braindead expansion concept ever
is the worst trailer WoW has ever had
fucking shadowlands
also
an league
im gonna work until then
start a call when the bools are on
work events lul
i also have an essay but i can spare an hour ish
so you dont overthink it
former
i sold way too early
but not enough to hold for 3k
because im galaxy brained
like 80% of it is from etherium
menial labor was the absolute pits
and working at the chinese school for like 3 years
also a few summer camp jobs
lab work at usc and gambling on etherium
yea ofc
if i cant get a job by then
fucking end me
i have like 2 years of savings
not invulnerable but barring a debilitating injury, cancer, or brain damage theres nothing
the fucking apocalypse?
no family
nowhere to turn
out of savings
how the fuck else would i end up unemployed
whats dishonest
well yea. i trust my parents are capable enough to plan and provide for themselves into old age
and at that point id just rather be dead
the only way we end up unemployed and out of savings is a crippling injury
theyd just be beggars really
then they arent even really the family i know
all their lifes savings
they wore out all the familial bonds
if they cant take care of themselves somehow
so yea
id rather die tbh
why bother with the weak
even then, even with all the resources of the cosmos
if you dont cut them off they just drain resources
theyre basically the crippled tribesman who cant even forage
they just cant sieze them
the resources and system are there
so they dont deserve the aid they cannot provide themselves
if the places were traded they couldnt do the same
why should those who can burden themselves with those who cannot
and they shouldve been left for dead
but in reality life is earned
idk. people want to think that now that we CAN carry those who cant run with us that we should
to pretend that our failures arent so bad
life means nothing. its just a lie we tell ourselves
self-genocide in china/cambodia
state sponsored genocide all over asia
south of the border theres countless murders
its really only americans and europeans that set the base value of a life so high
unsucessful
marginalized is another word for weak
or youre worth nothing
you make something of your life
because its true
clearly life is universally valued
after genocide
after genocide
i mean its not like we had genocides
yes im sure life was very valuable to ancient tribes slaughtering and raping
your life is worth as much as you make from it
you know
its just hippie new age bs that life is invaluable and precious
feed themselves
they could just
because we dont value the life
but we choose not to give it
it takes $2 to feed a starving african child for a week
life can obviously be quantified as a value
everything can be valued by potential and use
and the potential of its life
what gives a consciousness value is the clarity of its thoughts
almost the same as yours
theres 7 billion others out there
consciousness isnt all that rare
but theres a false equivalency between uniqueness and value here
the infinity of things that COULD be is greater than the infinity of things that are
no thats a correct mathematical statement
sure theyre all &quot;valuable and unique&quot; but the only ones that really matter are the ones with the most potential
its like having a bag of diamonds
so we use these differences to judge value
almost identical save the minute differences
they exist on a spectrum
people arent really all that unique
each snowflake is unique but they definitely dont matter
because everything is &quot;unique&quot;
this argument is meaningless
Considering every possible combination of matter which could exist in the space which you exist now, the fact that you exist there and something else doesn't has such a low probability that you are profoundly unique and as a result, your unique consciousness is meaningful due to its almost  impossibility and rarity 
therefore he is valued higher
reason says that you save the american one
like if you had to save one or the other
its just not worth it to invest in unlikely causes
youre equally likely to have ghandis in population subsets with higher potential
we have to go on probabilistic
but nothing is deterministic
of course, the more you look into people this proves untrue
you have to value him over the other
so without anything further to judge on
on an average scale
the american one has more potential
not really
but in the general sense its true
so you cant blanket say that NOBODY matters
like an african child isnt worth an american one
although personally i think that different people are valued differently
im just saying mars is right
im not arguing with you
fuck everyone else
its on you to make yourself happy
nobody matters
mars is right
gwyn_irl
well yea theyre clearly into each other
jojo and chill huh
looking at that game should give you aids
this isnt the first time right
because no soloq adc is going to play mundo or garen for you
shes really only good in pro play
the worst thing was just the targeted 80% slow
and i wouldnt have an issue
like cut a little damage off her R or healing on W
honestly though after all the nerfs shes ok
boom solved it
while shes on him
and infinite speed/hp
with the dps of a mage
thats why he becomes an unstoppable tank
its fucking garen's cat
shes some mage's familiar
she is tho
i just pretend they dont exist
i said the yordles needed an update
so he cant keep her
also senna is apparently gifted with immortal life
because they would lead him to what he wanted
he let them go
wait did you read threshs updated bio
when they tried to give them dimensionality 
because they made them too evil and sinister
demacia is worse now? kida
so theyre ok
freljord, noxus, shurima, shadow isles just got updated
that need to be updated
its like just yordles
all the revamped areas are good
idk the new lore after summoners were removed is cool
no meme
also league has a lore book coming out
just like i play souls for quality style and lighting
yes I too play league for its novel and exciting lore
and dull
just because its justified in the game doesnt mean that the art style isnt repetitive 
if you want to simplify styles like that
and has fire
everything in souls is dark
but its not less typical than dark souls
i mean yea its not as colorful and vibrant as it could be as an anime style
its just weeby
the art isnt that bad
AI means we can redistribute our labor into useful pursuits
clap his bionicle ass
thats a small final boss
tbh
shes gonna make him cringe to death
dva believes in your weeb ass
one sec i gotchu
because of what might occur
we hold ourselves back from whats possible
the biggest problem with this country is we put people before progres
and implement this on themselves
luckily theyre also the ones most likely to vote republican
eventually we will come to a consensus
so if we cant all agree then lets start by weeding out the voices that dont matter right
you take them out
when you have rotten apples you dont leave them in the barrel
the percent of reasonable people is not 100
no matter what number you take
and we will have weeded out the 1/5
if people are as good as you say they should have no problem doing so
to earn your voice
isnt it a better system to prove you are one of the reasonable and rational
when 1/5 cant be trusted with one
why do we need to give everyone a voice
so even if we take the 20% number
not that 95% support trump
95% are retards is what i said
at the least
of the country
its still 20%+
it still exists
idk what you mean by they learned
he still has a huge base
the best thing to do with them is remove their jobs, their voice
they cant learn
the biggest mistake you can make is giving them a platform and a voice
most people are worthless
like you think that everyone is rational but the truth is 
we cant even outlaw tech companies selling our data
dumb, poor, trash
because thats what they are
and voted
also because the dumb saw someone like them
only society will progress less because they dont have the skill to keep it running
either tyranny must be enforced on the masses or the masses will enforce tyranny on themselves
but people are greedy, irrational, uneducated
youre arguing that in a utopia where people are reasonable that democracy is the best choice
why do you put so much faith in uneducated trash. theyre the ones who voted trump in
imagine if at Samo we let the students vote for principle, teacher, policies, etc
they cant be allowed to make their own decisions
they were popular with the people but the people are dumb
how do you think Mao came into power. or Hitler. or stalin
when the 5% know whats best for it
the 95% of people can then decide to ruin the country
its fundamentally flawed because 51% can then vote to take everything from the other 49
democracy is just tyranny enforced through the masses
the smartest ones are the ones with the tools
i think its good that right now
some people have to be in charge and the others have to be kept in line
do you think that little peasant minds could ever have created and put such tools to use
you think that the masses wouldve utilized it as effectively
think of all the uses in every field for AI
ok wait think about what we've accomplished
wont be needed
because shit like manual labor or whatever
milo it wont mean you dont have to work itll mean you can finally do meaningful work
the saga of humanity must be continued by machines
if all biological humans die but AI continues humans still exist
AI will BE humanity if it takes over us
who cares if it takes over humanity
and greatly increase our productivity
force the populace into development
is a knife in our own back
every voice arguing for ethics and the slowing of progress
development is the answer and the way to win
than there is development
theres more argument about ethics
because soft heart retards care more about individuals than society as a whole
the real goal is for them to surpass us which is clearly happening
the eye surgery is because they want to be like the dominant power which for now is the west
and control the market
they have shares in all the companies
they emulated western culture to win but they don't like it. the government still pushes for more and more control
they think that the world finds it appealing and they will do anything to become &quot;the best&quot;
you grossly misunderstand the cultural reasoning behind that
the fuck
work towards it
instead of fighting the future we should accept it
under a different guise
even the fucking CCP is just a continuation of the imperial line
in chinese history the peasants never win. the dynasty always continues and the government remains the same
and theyll steamroll the world
even if the west decides to stop development china will create it
someone isnt paying attention to reality
in peasant trash
you put a lot of faith
lmao
imagine singularity, where the AI can improve itself and replace humans. think of the greater good itll create
especially when it has so much promise
we're never going to stop the development of new tech
etc
smarter
the people developing it are richer
how are you going to stop it lol
and theres nothing stopping that code from being written
but once we have AI smarter than people itll be over
i dont think itll be intentional
the problem is that most jobs are hyper focused on a specific task and college is meant to teach you how to think
the university system is a scam in that for most jobs now you dont need a degree BUT soon that won't be true
the individuals wont matter when they can be replaced
and all it takes is the ability to harness it
limitless power and potential
theres a sick quote from elon musk where he describes AI as &quot;having summoned the demon&quot;
this is stuff that could literally redefine what is needed for society and what makes us human
humanity holds the greatest power its ever known right now
its literally saving billions of man hours of labor thats frankly redundant and a waste of human potential
theres no reason humanity would ever pause something so grand
automation is the greatest advance and tool of our time
and processes old documents into PDFs or whatever is needed
but industrial servers can train one that recognizes written characters with 99%+ accuracy
our lab is working on it without back-propagation training so it can run on any laptop 
yea its a huge part of the image recognition field of AI
not really, theres AI that can recognize handwriting now
like every field is already facing automation and theres an oxford study showing that 47% of jobs will be automated in the next 25 years
Babylon or smth has 85% accuracy on some test where MDs only top out at 75%
theres like 4 competing companies who have diagnosis AI 
so less low-level grunts are needed to dredge up case files
most law firms are cutting down on new hires because legal discovery is automated now
and hired a huge engineering team instead
goldman sachs went from 600 traders to just 2 since 2000
banks are poised to cut most of their staff
nah i think itll be in our lives
stuff where data is hard to come bu
like archeology
weirdly i think itll be jobs where you need to know a lot about very niche things that are likely new
not how to operate a specific job
the day is coming where you will need a degree or a huge amount of creative specialization to avoid being automated away
i think its a good process
also getting one is proof you can transition to professional work from school projects
internships lead to full offers if you prove good enough. the point of interns is any idiot can get a degree so you want to test them for quality. if theyre good then you already onboarded them anyway
Those aren't conflicting. You should do an internship before transferring is what they're saying
Oh boy
Instead of blizzard. I can give my money right to China 
Pog
you two should fuck and get this tension out
if that makes it happen
so if i do that i dont even need to leave the house xd
yea im in the process for this gps startup thats fully remote
and maybe it blows up and im set for life
so id rather take the risk at a startup
but like i have my parents and christina to support me if shit goes down
just well off
amazon stock is never going to make you rich as fuck
i want to do a startup cause the stock is higher reward there
idk it depends
but the usual 40 hour weeks
he doesnt know yet
id also have said fuck you i want mroe
i would be but like
nah hes excited
hes getting shafted
nah theres 3 other people ik who got 140
so
and he didnt argue up
their start
which is like
112k + 26k signing bonus doubled after a eyar
although the offer kinda sucks for amazon standards
i forgot to apply in the summer kms
lucky bitch
well connor got an offer from amazon
but official
its literally mobile legends
disgusting
childrens card game hype
that last game
league was fucking terrible
xd
im also glad its over. my crippling hatred of the poor will never let me be satisfied with income
or she showered between
yea maybe if it was the last thing
same thing
also piss
thats a no go
no matter how hot she is
exactly
idk what if she wants to shit on your chest
you want to do other stuff to her
but then you dont want to piss on her
even if she wanted it tho
why would you do that
still no
which means you still need to put in a fuckton of work
only for california its over 100
even if you arent competing with others you still need to make yourself happy which is the &quot;70k&quot;
also 132k is almost double
30k is ~40% deviation from 70k
70k is far from the number
so if you adjust this to properly account for where you want to live
In Los Angeles-Long Beach, CA you'd need $105,589; in Sacramento, CA you'd need a salary of $85,400; and $132,853 in San Francisco
As people earn more money, they start to question how satisfied they are with their lives and their earnings. This includes comparing themselves to others and how they stack up. To feel satisfied with their life evaluation took a $95,000 salary
This study was global, however, so the lower numbers may have come from countries that have much lower costs of living
and 10 years ago
not 70k
Back in 2010, a study done at Purdue University concluded that $75,000 was the magic income an individual needed to be happy
im mostly denying your claim that 70k is &quot;good enough&quot;
its always shirt weather
its convenient
i only go there to snowboard
its terrible
also theres weather changes and shit there
while im in fucking colorado
no cause id still know theres people in LA living it up
mars im counting 70k as the ~6k a month toatl income from family/job/bank incentives
theyre beautiful and natural too
country clubs
michelin star food
teslas and chargers
you know whats cooler
your solution to making no money is to live in bumfuck nowhere
not near anything novel and cool
way less food choices
where the fuck would i move that this money is &quot;happy&quot;
i have to go grocery shopping instead of ordering or having a cook or smth
i have a roommate
and it still sucks here
actually i have like a 70k budget pretty much if i count the paycheck i get from the school
im living in a place and budget coming out to the equivalent of 50k and it sucks
they probably arent that happy then
and theyre not even graduated
like 15% of the people i know already have job offers for 110+
70k also just isnt that much
if i live in an RV i cant just go out and find a mansion
and theyd probably love me back
if i had a mansion to myself i could find someone i love easily
because i sure as fuck wouldnt be
work up to 70k
40k out of college
are you ok if you peak at 70k
ok what about salary then
would you be happy living in a 300k house in arkansas
whats your minimum then
this is the minimum for my happiness
two kids
a nice 60k car
a house in SM
i mean lets take minimums
70k youre looking at a 2 bedroom at best
cause at that point youre set for anything reasonable
if you said 700 id believe you
dude if i made 70k id be pretty fucking unhappy
the ticket to every happiness
money is literally the cure to every problem
the MOST renowned dishes are not $3
but no money guarantees no quality
you want hot hookers you need money
money
you want tasty food, nice drinks, servants and staff
money gets you anything you consider good
you cant experience the good shit that way
you cant stay in 5* resorts on 30k
drink fine wine<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1571030555046" ts="1571030555" t="61"></e_m>
drink fine wine<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1571030555046" ts="1571030555" t="61"></e_m>
eat exotic food
see countries you couldnt
you could also work harder and experience all of life
take 4 vacations in different places
drive a different car to work every day
use them
4 vacation homes
have a garage full of cars
ok then to have the things yourself
etc
cars
to give your kids houses
than making enough money and needing to acquire the other things
which is objectively way harder
then you have to live with making less money
money solves everything
nannies and store bought fish
you can just pay others to do that
you dont have to have the most but you have to have more than however many people youre happy having more than
why would you if you gain nothing
then you grossly overestimate the chance it helps you i guess
i wouldnt do it at the mall or out of town
places where the people are likely to be important
like i only hold the door at uni or at work or smth
others would see the chance as so small its not worth it
because they may see the numbers differently
the cost is small (1) and the chance is small (1/100000) but the reward is big enough you've judge it to be worth (120000)
its the logical thing to do. you lose almost nothing but you might impress someone who will give you something
you do that because society says its the right thing and youll be judged negatively if you dont
then you don't exist because nobody has ever done that
you save someone's life and they give you something back
help provided to people nets you help in return
even besides the satisfaction
exactly why altruism doesnt exist
so thats not altruistic
but even then I gained knowledge from it
never again
i mean ive done it once
item 2 ive been told is true
*nobody sane and reasonable
item 1 for sure
i guess?
personal satisfaction
with the receiver
improved relations
not even close
name one unselfish act done with no benefit to the performer
crazies maybe
people just weigh the cost/benefit differently
you always consider what you get from it and do it when you think the benefit is worth it
nobody does anything for purely altruistic reasons
and thats why altruism doesnt exist
thats why people do it
doing things for others is only worth it when you gain more than you give
and he will have been the idiot that cause it
his gene pool will die out
his children got nothing and they will suffer
say on the other hand youre that retard who gave 10 million to the school in his will
the benefits people will give you might outweigh that, so you do it
say you put in 1000 to charity all publicly and shit
exceeds the cost of being altruistic
thats only because the reward for altruism
the altruism gene is bullshit. its a free for all
so...thats how you earn the stuff that matters
your family is less likely to
if the others succeed your kids are less likely  to
no, fuck the collective, theyre the competition. you, your family, your peers are the allies
youre successful when you think to yourself &quot;ok, ive beaten enough people that my kids will certainly beat enough people&quot;
you do so by passing on the most wealth to your kids so they have the best odds to reproduce
thats ALL life is
youre trying to make your genes last the longest
life is certainly a competition
youre successful when youre happy with how many people youre better than
its also to just be better than other people
and as long as the status quo is kept itll stay meaningful
not right now it isnt
because theyve wasted their lives chasing success thats now meaningless
then everyone who worked so hard for financial success is screwed
im not rewriting my life plan because of hippie empathy and ethics
thats worse
then what. you change all your life goals to this new idea of success?
the more you have over others the more youve succeeded. UBI means the successes youve earned are worth less
success is subjective
all the work youve put in to now means jack shit cause its handed out for free
are you really going to toil your whole life just to see others do nothing and get what you have
do you really want it
and anyway even if universal basic income is the &quot;right&quot; choice
if youre on food stamps and run out you starve
its already legal
and they never want to accept a helping hand
they cant be trusted with their own decisions. the democrat candidates are always better for them
these people are doomed
ive known enough trash. a significant amount of my family still lives in the taiwanese countryside
which part
that way we can elect officials to act on their interests for them because we know whats best
they cant change. its better to cut losses. put them out of job and home. ensure they dont reproduce or at least dont vote
the opposite of what he promised
and done nothing against people like us
they voted for someone who has hurt them the worst
and they used it to hurt themselves
because we give these idiots a voice
ik you want to think of them as people but consider the quality of people
racist old farmers, dumb truckers, illegal construction workers, etc
those are the people automation will replace though
whats society's return on investment for keeping these people? trump, the KKK, mass shootings
or the mentally deranged
like what are we hoping to get from bible thumping racist boomers
or in this case productivity from a vegetable
rather than try to force blood from a stone
the best solution may be to actually cut your losses
sunk cost fallacy there though
thats the most productive theyll ever be
youre conserving the resources needed to preserve them
i dont understand how its wasteful
we say get fucked to them
im saying we give them a test and if they can do nothing else
a truck can drive itself 24 hours a day and never cause an accident so we dont need the truckers. im not saying we just say get fucked to them
so we dont need the people
one machine can do the work of 1000 people
we dont need them to now
and that was needed
at least peasants still grew food
reaping the rewards of society is ok when you are part of the contributors
if we could test them for aptitude and just cull those without itd be ok
the problem is that when its proven they CANT contribute people still have to support them
yes but theyre reaping the rewards of others
its not overpopulated but theres too many people right now who dont contribute meaningfully
if they fight back the military and police will put them down
they dont contribute so they starve
plus its just right
yea but this way theyre on the opposite side of the law
win win
if they do theyre burning their own homes so
if they dont riot, they cant afford food and shit to live
historically riots hurt the poor the worst so rebellion will achieve the intended effect
and let them starve out within 2 generations
but in actuality its easier to just get rid of their jobs
and wtf are they gonna do against the terminator
maybe one day we make an AI that determines how to best improve society and it goes to cull them
you dont really know that
then we gucc
yea they don't belong. if we just get rid of them
if you think about it, the people who dont belong are the ones who make it not work
society works so well
why tho
and dont belong
when youre out youve proven you consume more than you produce
but its also your proof that you earned a place within society
money isnt skill true
by your forefathers
inheritance isnt working hard but your place in society has been earned
thats the point of doing it
if you were worth that much youd give it to your kid too
bank errors
mislabeled documents
car crashes
someone in his past was skilled enough to make that money<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1571026301275" ts="1571026301" t="61"></e_m>
someone in his past was skilled enough to make that money<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1571026301275" ts="1571026301" t="61"></e_m>
yea but if we let humans keep their jobs we keep getting shitty diagnoses
so if they dont work how are they earning a place in society
thats a different argument
the retards
to subsidize
you want people who work and are skilled
ok hold up
food safety is a huge issue in restaurants
doctors misdiagnose 1/10 patients
you let those truck drivers keep driving and theyll kill ~9x more people than the AI
hassle prevented
yea but youre forgetting that efficiency in these cases is lives saved
theres only articles saying we should just not progress because some people cant cope
parsa AI best doctor in the world
also i just wanted to link that cause the dude's name is parsa
etc
or articles saying that the world will end
trying to see this from the other side is cancer though
i guess thats usable enough
make human more money and product
computer do job better than human
and ill just quote you guys for the paper
and why we need humans
give me your hippie ideas on why automation sucks
so i have to do a paper on computer vision and argue both for and against it because the class is retarded
Riot is truly desperate
nah its still kind of white people tho. affirmative action disproportionately helps them
is that Common in wow
wait i thought the arthas song was in latin
fuck classic give me WotLK back
same actually
finding another choice is just giving them a chance to win before we find the other option
thats safer
theres also the option right in front of us
or sell him your soul
no matter what the choices are become the devil
theyre too proud of being one people that they would never truly rebel for major change because it might lead to another century of humiliation
therye too united to view themselves as individuals
the oppressive dynasty system ends only to be replaced by the PRC
dynasty falls only to be replaced by another
every rebellion always leads to reunification under the same thing
theyve never been fractured by rebellion
thats how china was felled last time
you can only beat them by force
you cant beat them by humanitarianism 
they cant be swayed on that
they literally think theyre divinely chosen
they view the government as an extension of the dynasty
they never will
they dont recognize the government as an oppressor
and those people will never rise up
not to china though
the poor have no voice there
you do understand that right
the ones who arent dont count in china
theyre coming for us far more united than we are
many are incredibly wealthy
youre thinking of old china. most of them are now middle class
because thats what they think is their rightful place
they would ALL give up freedom to become the dominant force again
all of them would give up freedom to never again be subjugated by the west
they care about the money and power thats been given to them and thats it
they truly love them for pulling so many from starvation and poverty
the people think the PRC saved them from the demonic west
china fractures but never falls
2000
if not longer
theyve been one civilization since 200BCE
china is as close to immortal as a nation gets
they truly hate us
they view the west as demons who subjected them to a century of humiliation
theyre proud of this
living with parents and grandparents is the right call though
if not the world
for thousands of years they were the dominant civilization in the region
china loves their history and the people are proud of it
ill give a brief explanation
most of china truly loves the government
idk where youre getting that
they arent pissed off
but thats the only way
freedom wins
and always keep ahead
if we had the tech to neutralize their subs and missles
and passed the ball to asia
freedom has crippled us
freedom loses if china wins this game
we need the tech to keep their advantages in check
their numbers will always be greater so we need a better force multiplier
the only way to do so is make sure our force is always superior
winning is to not be taken over by china and to not let them control more of asia and the world
because, jett, the only way to win is to play
better the devil you know
if their military were stronger hong kong would be toast
so they can never directly act against us
is to beat them in tech
the way to win against china
itd be quashed in a day and nobody would know
if this movement ever sprang up in china
because the west is watching
hong kong is only still able to rebel
you think its hard to tiananmen square a movement
weve shown emotions can be read by these cameras
my lab has already proved you can both recognize a person from a mile away in second with a cheap camera and china has cameras that can identify everyone in a crowd of tens of thousands
china has the technology to ensure there are never leaders
rebellions need leaders
it has equipment and technology every other totalitarian state can only dream of
theres so little chance china collapses on itself
we keep the right to be free in every other way
we force kids to pursue stem and wealth
conforming on this one thing is a small price for continued freedom
we have to win or theyll force us to conform to EVERYTHING
yea and this is why asia is making so much more money and developing so much research even though the west has centuries of colonial resources and way more educational background
none of which you gain by refusing to conform to your parents
yes but the things that matter are: financial success, community respect, family success
you wont be any more
otherwise when the chinese come buy your land and country
you need discipline to remain free
and the inability to conform
because of individual desires
we're giving up control of the world
My parents and Christina's parents didn't marry for love 
and also that the west is doing worse than the east right now
you know thats only a western right
stand by and let them flounder
but sure
theyll be much more likely to be less successful
no nanny or tutor could ever do that
without straining the parent-child relationship
and discipline
who can impose a whole life's worth of wisdom
and your kids are educated by the elders
you save on childcare costs
so they can better thrive and walk the right path
its strength to be able to abandon your kid when they need it
like if i go home without a job i wont even have a night
and so if i clearly didnt have enough theyd send me out
my parents know what being alone and outcast is. but they also learned strength comes from discipline
because theyre afraid of losing you
if they love you &quot;without limit&quot; then its cause theyre hiding their true feelings
thats an unrealistic expectation to have of them
and if your spouses parents approve
if they approve
like if you get married youre going to ask
yes but if you make a major decision you should ask them
and who cared for you when you when nobody in this world would
who have known you longer than youve known yourself
and its to listen to the ones who are wiser than you
youre free to make a choice but im arguing theres always a right choice
Different people are predispositioned to different pursuits 
is them
everything that makes you who you are
raised by them
youre made from them
gwyn you ARE them
eventually youll see it too
ive gone against htem
thats proven true every time
they know better
theyre wiser and longer lived
they do love you so they want you to do whats best for yourself
if you love them then youd do what they want
they chose to for you so its right to reciprocate
than you have to lose by conforming to them
they had more to give up and gave it to you
in raising you
they lost twice the years of their lives as you
is your personal identity worth more than that
think of what they lost or gave to you
so you think that because theyre your parents they owe you everything
again youre abandoning the ones you owe
is extremely selfish
fighting for yourself over the community
and selfish
is straight up ungrateful
to ignore those who gave you everything
to ignore everyone around you is to fight for nothing
they have access to your other family
then you have no leverage
if they want something from you
all im saying is that conforming is the right choice imo. you cant change your parents and you have more to lose than them
yea lets say she wanted him to be
you get nothing
you never see or hear from them again
where would you pick
jett if you came out and your mom said choose your partner or your family
so ill do what they want
but i want them
ok but they dont owe me houses and money
thats not outrageous
of their own flesh and blood
they want grandkids
i mean i understand them and so i think its ok they think that way
because you know i want my inheritance and family to be tehre for me
and i have an obligation to meet them
because they have these things called expectations
and if i decided to marry some dude and never have kids theyd probably cut me off
if i cut off my arm or some shit theyd be confused
my parents respect my autonomy but not absolutely
if things go wrong
he loses a place to return to
are you going to give up all you have for some stupid argument
is that worth it
then what
so then she cuts you off and leaves you with nothing
not listening to them is shooting yourself in the foot
they only want whats best for you
also why bother going against your parents
is stupid
but until then giving it all up for an ideology
then i can say and do what i want
when i have my own money and respect
and i can make the calls
well i'll be free when i have a family then
who will hire someone when the whole community says theyre disrespectful and worthless
it really will
and have opportunities
to be part of the communith
because you need their respect
over a disagreement
give up all your money, family, etc
like what else are you going to do
but if they dont change then you do
you have the freedom to change their minds obviously
or change them
you just have to respect what they want
which they are
it doesnt matter if your parents are in the wrong
sophie still hasnt come out to her parents or mine because to do so would mean losing them essentially
is what makes people respect you
how you act towards your parents and how successful you are
money and respect are your place in society
its what makes you part of society
its called propriety
would be abhorrently disrepectful
e
because to let his parent's material go to wast
xiahou dun was shot in the eye in battle and plucked it out and ate it
the physical material to make you
the lost opportunity
for the monetary value of raising you
you owe your parents
you dont owe strangers shit
its more than help
they made you
people helped you
who raised it
jett who gave you that body
you pretty much have to do what they say
and gave you everything
what are you going to do. they spent so much to raise you
im literally not allowed to go back home if i so much as get a tattoo 
with any significant deviatiosn
most parents i know wont acknowledge their kids
ok well your parents are the exception
no
if youre the worst sibling
will your parents love you
how will you face your family if youre the fuck up
pride, pleasure, respect
more money is always good
thats so blatantly wrong i cant even start
all round
even though then they had family
my parents think of the worst time in their lives as when they were poorest
will provide you the means to have it
yes but your sucess
thats physical happiness
silk gowns, temperature control, lavish meals
rather than trying to achieve emotional happiness without physical
so you only then feel the physical happiness of good food, nice things, etc
emotions can be locked away
physical happiness is bought though
and far more happy
but most asian parents i know dont care for each other but are wealthy and successful
so theres many mediocre couples who dont succeed
western culture says to marry for love
i think chasing happiness is what causes sadness
feel nothing -&gt; succeed -&gt; recall happiness -&gt; succeed -&gt; etc
so all it takes is locking away what you dont want and letting yourself feel what you want
if you think about a happy thought or sad thought you physically feel it right
just what you tell yourself to
yes but youre forgetting it doesnt matter what you really feel
And have truly earned it
Then gain logical satisfaction from success. The ability to say you're happy
Success. Money. Better lives for family
And your children will benefit more
Even so your life will have been more productive and meaningful
It feels like nothing after you did
Locking it away is moving on
Or dwell on it
When you break up do you feel better when you ignore it
Maturity comes from learning to ignore it
They lack skill 
Babies feel
That makes no sense
Feeling more skillfully
Also growth comes intellectually. Wtf is emotional growth 
If you raise them to be successful
Because they take care of you
Also you profit from it
Idk my parents said it is
No because it's easy. Things that are hard are what contains value
Is anything easy taught
And I have that
And not be crippled by it
Emotional discipline is the skill to not feel
Love is easy. Emotion is easy
They take the easily achieved happiness
And need false happiness
They lack mental discipline
Made up by those who want you to fail so they can succeed
Because love is a scam
But they're happy
And their happiness is from success
No not really. satisfaction comes from success
Distracts you
It holds you back
It's an impairment even
It's meaningless and a crutch
It's nothing
Love is shit man
Love doesn't produce power
Cars don't run on care
Creative and caring don't progress the world
You could be the most disadvantaged fucker but the laws of reality won't show themselves to you over someone more learned
Doesn't care
Research
Jobs don't care what you went through
Whoever is accepting you defines it
Your score and tested ability 
Objective society is simple. Only consider relevant skills
Your fair shot is the right to be judged objectively
Yes but fairness must consider your ancestors
What right do they have to succeed
So if they can't and their parents weren't
Inner city kids could succeed too if they were like her
That's why I didn't let depression get me
I don't. I'm living on her gifts and try to copy her attitude
That's fair. Greatness bestows reward
This is what it takes to succeed. If you don't then your kids are fucked
Siblings 
Fought depression and raised signings
Food 
Went to school. Had to acquire good
My mom lived alone starting at 12
Diagnosed
Fixed myself by mental discipline 
Went to therapy. Realized it was worthless 
Ninth grade
Specifically
What situation 
You can force yourself to be better
And in turn cures hopelessness
Inner discipline fixes wallowing
Alexander faced the Persians in a hopeless situation and led the charge himself rather than surrender
That's fact
That's the attitude you need. People who wallow waste that energy
I turned the hopelessness into fuel and do my lab now
I got rejected by every internship
No I channel it into my work
Anguish is fuel
Drive you to fix it
And it didn't light a fire under you
Never settle for what you have man
You guys are soft wtf
That's how it should be
Disappointment is payment for failure
Everyone should desire huge triumph
You fucking should be punished for desiring mediocrity
Then they're wrong wtf
Be the one to succeed
Be the change
Yes
Until one of them conquers their shitty start
They failed
And again their parents are to blame for that
Less outside pursuits
Compared to me they need lower scores
Gwyn they clearly aren't being denied shit. Their parents and mine had the same chance
No police
There was a lot of crime
Compared to village poverty
Etc
Government support 
With supermarkets
Honestly the inner city parents had it better
You succeed so your family can
So their bloodline gets to benefit 
One succeeded
They were in the same situation
It's really inner city kid vs my parents
The failures remain
The skilled rise
No, just some
Then why do you deserve it then
If you can't it's a personal failure
Gwyn clearly it's possible to conquer poverty
You owe them
They raised you
They're always your parents man
And talent
Poor people born without skills
Wtf
No. You shouldn't be
Born like it
Because they have no drive and no talent
Also I don't hate white people. Just the culture
Poverty happens when you fail 
Considering most of her village conquered it
It's hard to imagine blaming it on your failures
I've seen my mom's village
Poverty isn't hard to comprehend
But whites who do the same end up ceos
All I'm saying is Asians who work super hard and are incredible outliers end up with upper middle class jobs and lifestyles
It's the same with blacks and sports
Even in American University they're usually the top
There's so many of them with PhDs. Most research comes from China
Which Asians are unfairly evaluated on
It's all objective skill
Cause they had none and made it
It's not about economic advantage
My mom is from a poor rural village literally raising their own food man
They were worse than any inner city kids
Also I'm well off because my parents came with nothing to their name and worked up to it
Yes change my identity because you know the white people expect it
Full ride
I'd be in cal tech
I'm salty because if I were white with what I have
Like affirmative action
The problem is that when it's overcome white people come up with new ways to fuck you
Railroad workers to rich
See Chinese Americans
Income inequality can be overcome
To keep most of them in check
Affirmative action and shit kicked in
Asians started poor as sit in this country and when they succeeded
Because then the bias would keep them out 
No they wouldn't
Do you think they'll produce as much research
As people who did get tutored
Do you think they're as smart and ready 
And demographic limits
Get rid of sat bias
Yes you level the playing field by evaluating all people objectively
Or marry a rich woman 
You're more likely to get a business loan
To succeed in the only important aspect
Etc
Jobs
To get into schools
The biggest advantage of which is literally needing half the effort
Get in the real world and look at all the shit you get free for being white
Do you think we live in ancient Greece 
All in intellect
Is literally
Value in academia and the work place
Research is produced through intellect
To do a PhD you literally need novel research
Humanities is too 
Yes academia is literally all reasoning and memory
And your value
When you're in academia your value is literally your advantage
The one with the intelligence or the one with a disadvantage
Who's the better doctor
That still means they know less
Etc
More experience and relevant skills
Better extracurricular
When there's millions of Asians with better scores 
So why do we accept less intelligent people from other races into academia
Like if I'm a cripple you won't hire me to work construction
Then they're still under skilled
Bias is literally racism
Objectivity is the fair method
Not based on racial average
It should be objective
That's bullshit and you know it
With literally 35/36 on act I didn't get any ivy leagues
Asians need to score 50 above whites to get into the same school
Fine then let's talk educating
Outside of tech if I apply for the same job as Connor he'd make 20% more
If all whites were as educated they'd make 100k average
When an unqualified cracker is almost as good as a qualified Asian
So clearly there's bias in pay
Many of whom are not educated
The average Asian is college educated and highly skilled and still only makes 20k more on average than whites
Also Asians work so much harder
By wage
Whites do
Which is hella gay
You legit can put in half the work as any other race and do as well
Point is America sucks. Asians have to be twice as good and even then schools only accept so many before turning to unqualified whites, blacks, etc
Like they're the Mexicans of Asia
All of Southeast Asia dreams of domination
They're Asia's bitch
Yea that makes sense
In like all east Asia
Disney is good there 
If I was black they'd be paying me
If I was white I'd be in Harvard or some shit with a full ride
Like sat scores, mcat, etc
Anyway the main point is Asians have it kind of shit. Like with Hollywood you have to be way above others to get the same result
Especially with China owning so much of Africa they get used a lot
Bc you can't show criminals get away with shit against the Chinese officials but others can be incompetent or criminal
Black people may be more prominent because that's how film makers skirt the censorship
If they do it's as a token
That's... Not even true. White people almost never show up in Chinese film
probably
That's not the majority opinion tho. Just mine
Although personally I don't want to see Chinese anyway 
The problem is literally that Hollywood is racist as fuck
Unless you want to count native Americans I guess
And TV 
You know the least represented demographic in film is Asians right
Anyone up for gamer hours want to see joker later
makes sense now
didnt know that
and youre straight
i thought grindr was for gays
exactly
thats cute you two should fuck
this is unheard of
where do you find random people to fuck on a college campus
its not like communism where you get fucking shot for learning
if you fail, it means you weren't good enough to overcome what you were handed
nobody can cause your failure it can only be harder for you to succeed
there are people who succeeded even with the worst conditions. like theres inner city kids who grow up to be rich and successful
everyone else likes it
but that probably means
ok i strongly disagree with this system because it evens out the differences between those who play the system successfully and those who fail
people CAN learn to be intelligent and skilled
they dont because they dont try or have incredibly low natural talent
thats just part of it
well they should also know whats good for them
i still disagree with milo/jett/gwyn
yep
we're getting rid of people with low skill
thats fine
fuck those people for not having talent
like transportation, service, etc
we should get rid of menial jobs
but yea my opinion is that for now
theyll be in the cloud as AI-human fusions
but essentially yes
well itll be more than one person
long term the last thing an AI will be unable to do is create new ideas
thats short term
to be the last humans before reaching singularity
and keep only the best and brightest
the goal here is to eliminate the need for people
nah AI can do that
and will continue the human race as AI-fused immortals
as they should be
all others will have been culled
those who have made it that far are the best and deserve to be there
and at that point humans are redundant and can be provided for by the AIs
that would imply a general ai exists
and develop their thoughts and skills
its up to everyone to keep ahead of the curve
at the given moment
anything done that an AI or machine can't do
unless theyre producing intellectual labor
humans are a waste of resources
thats kind of where we need to be
because thats all humans are good for
yea and to do so you just get rid of all non-intellectual jobs
but we'll get there
might take longer
at least i hope
except research
like if you just give it 20 years we wont need people for basically anything
theres also people working on a formula to calculate the emotional response by a song
and have a few humans vet it for good ones
its only a step up to introduce more randomness
theres already AI that can paint and write music
idk i think eventually AI will take over design, construction, entertainment
dude they already are. AI will free them to learn to be useful
later
because youll never have a fair deal
you cant pay for what cant be measured
in response to specific chemicals released by love
and youll see it recepts differently
scan the brain
yea you can tho
fucking unicorns are real
otherwise are you gonna say
it probably doesnt exist
ok if you cant measure something
for being unproductive
them
the government giving these people money is essentially rewarding the
of human time and effort
than permanent waste
temporary unrest is better
but it was a good thing
the first factories pushed people out of jobs
humans are inherently lazy
since the dawn of man people have been pushing to get rid of menial tasks
the writing on the wall has always been there
if you dont then its on you
but I have something valuable i can do
well yea ofc its dependant on personality
youll be content
and once youre where you want to be
working your way up produces happiness
or move companies
like promote
but then you can push for more
and find personal satisfaction
even if you work retail you can try to optimize what youre doing
and being on the cutting edge of something
it feels good solving problems
also theres happiness in working
like im significantly less happy in college but also its worth it so i just deal with it
take the temporary L
you go for it after achieving what you have to
and get nowhere
you fall into chasing it
happiness is a trap
yes but they feed into universities
the ccp put them in all over china
public schools 
then you live the good life rich and happy and important
until youre 30
who cares about happiness you only have to deal with it
way faster
and they progress
like their working week is way longer
china is doing great though and their people put in the hours
unless you literally only count rich chinese
asians do worse than whites on average
is 
most of my major
and for the record im colored
by fucking removing the need for them to work
you know how to fix peoples real problemms
its honestly easy
like i can tutor for 353 while still thinking how to do the lab shit i have to do
you can think about two things at once
then you can relax
and build your skillset
only long enough to establish yourself 
and again you dont have to do it forever
or whatever you want to do
that still leaves 6 waking hours for gaming
its not that hard to do 80 its like 11 hours a day
controlled by the elite
who you know gets paid by the government
yea but peasants with guns cant do shit against an army
they dont even have the courage to revolt lmao
is more important than numbers
force multiplier
those people have nothing
why do you fit into society
if you have neither
humans are for specialization and adapatability
machines will always be better
where we dont need humans doing it
and menial to the point
but manual labor is bad for your health
and league and shit
i still get to run campaign
its honestly not that bad
either thats racist
so then i only need 35-40 a week
like by the time i have a job ill pretty much always have one bar fucking going to prison
you only have to do 80 a week until youre irreplaceable
thats on them then. they didnt put in the work so theyre replaceable
etc
programming bootcamps to get into jobs without a degree
theres a million online courses teaching everything
its a process. people who dont do it are lazy
and i still do spend like 80 hours a week working
i mean i also studied so much for it
all of you have a talent. you dont have to defend these people
otherwise you arent worth keeping around
you need to have or build a talent
ik. i still stand by it though
that can replace most people eventually
bc i said i work in an AI lab developing basically easy to run and train AI
actually im pretty sure my professor hates me 
nah i have
if it helps whoevers writing it and frees people from menial labor
its like the jobs thing. theres no obligation for programmers to NOT develop job-stealing AI
and thats stupid shit
like 10 paid days off doing it
like the article was saying companies should provide paid time off if you do public service work 
google/amazon/whatever dont owe free anything to people
to provide free tech or services
theres no obligation for engineers or universities
like my stance was just if you arent good enough you dont get to beg for free shit
rich gf
enough inheritance in case shit gets rough
nice job lined up easily
ive probably got mine
id assume most of them think im a psychopath but whatever
i straight said &quot;no. everyone should get their own on their own&quot;
like how lawyers and doctors do public shit like dwb or being a public defender or whatever
and the one time the professor asked me about do engineers have an ethical obligation to help the public
like i say nothing personal about myself in writing
like if you only knew me through class youd think i was a psychopath too
tbh theyre probably just cruising through class
she knows it was justified
she was in that game
xd
maybe theyre just business majors then
they could just be the same
like i just straight dont like people
i mean what if thats just how they are
ik what you mean now
what do people without emotions say
what does something emotional is missing mean
take out the &quot;guys&quot; and its 90%
that sounds like 45% of people in universities
that makes sense
they really chilled out<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1569967041275" ts="1569967041" t="61"></e_m>
they really chilled out<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1569967041275" ts="1569967041" t="61"></e_m>

oh wait they fully redid ashes VO
good art tho
truly unique
except shes an angel
they made a wild west ashe
typical capitalist

that is starting
thats like 93k a year
idk when theyre starting
at 45/hr its ~30 hours of work after tax so less than a week
tbh tho 3500/4 is 875 which isnt much each month
or faggots that only want 2 people
well you also have to check if they let 4 people in those places tho. some are legit 2 bedrooms that wont fit 2 people each
so you can rent their place in center ktown for cheap
you should find some old korean family and get in reallly good with them

So after the events of infinity war Thanos returned to his 'garden', that place that was visible in infinity war when he described what he'd do after he finished his work. The remaining Avengers decide to get revenge and take the fight to him. What they didn't expect though: When they arrived on that garden planet, they found Thanos completely nude. He decided to put up his armor as a scarecrow in the garden. He was cheerfully jacking it while watering the plants when the Avengers arrived. When I saw that scene in the cinema, I must say, I was shocked at the realism of Thanos' computer generated cock. Honestly, it was unreal. You could see his veins and shit on his cock. It looked so real, I almost thought it was my own - but Thanos' dick was huuuge. I mean I am not bad in that department but Thanos is just next level. The length of his cock was fucking insane. Whetever, lets continue. So then there is a flashback in which Black Panther gave Tony Stark the N-Word pass. After that scene finished, You see the Avengers approaching Thanos who is watering the plants with his cum. Tony Stark comes closer, closer, closer and whispers into Thanos' ear. The whole theater was dead silent during this scene. Stark whispers &quot;guacamole nigga penis&quot;. Then Thanos cums again, but so much that he and all the Avengers drown in it. So beware of fake spoilers, bacause in the end all avengers are dead. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

Apparently. Idc tho cause even shit cs jobs are 6 figures so I have my money
Nah she doesn't. Weirdly it's the same dynamic our parents have so its normal to us 
Also when our parents die we'd have 8-9 properties in sm and silicon valley so we wouldn't even have to work
Idk I like the life plan. Means I can spend a lot of time on not work stuff
my girl wants to work one of those really intense high paying careers tho so were set
feel. i want to just work a chill job for chill pay
i deserve 30 thats just industry standard goddamnit
but fuck i feel so jew'd
i guess at this point im ok with 20+
for .12 its not

theres probably a world where you just take the time to do independent projects or clubs and shit to look better
jett is the job even worth it tho. what are they paying besides the benefit
capitalism as intended
especially my field. you can half ass an internship and sit around on your computer all day for more pay than most of america
and cash to burn on dumb shit
something to do in the summer
idk working is nice
today i learned
also apparently you can qualify for need based scholarships with parents earning half a million+ a year
jett you can just beg milo for money
i mean you can have rich parents and be poor if they dont like you and refuse to support you and give you money
and we all resort to peasant labor
when the economy dies
to fall back on
hey but just remember no matter how bad youre doing at least you have parent
its never going to appreciate you better just hope they dont depreciate too fast
why are you even discussing cars as a good investment you lose 20% of the value driving it off the lot
kapp
and i will definitely change things 
they should give me all their money so i can become one
the classist overlords have stifled the working class long enough
literally 2/3rds of america makes under 30/hr or smth
who has a steady income these days
we should already own it
no michael the trick is
probably more money than the antivax donation site
ez money
rent them out
we buy some houses by silicon valley
i thought of another way we can make fat passive income
we need the working class to rise up against our robot overlords
the big portion of jobs there already got automated
its like law
and the field will be way harder to get into
maybe its already passed too
were probably the last generation where medicine is a good field to go into
bold move
going into medicine
cause 300k total including med school and residency and all that isnt awful
if he gets in
300 for just undergrad or counting med school
those are very different
by a lot
premed != med
but i guess its really 400k/yr after college for 2
cause her parents income is 500k/yr
shes at least debt free
that sucks
which is unlucky
which i know cause apparently christina isnt on scholarship and pays full
thats like our semester price lul
for tuition price
32k/year is really good
nah the free money has to be worth more than whatever my parents are giving me and my inheritance or else &quot;be poor&quot; is a shit strat
yea but how much free money
cause after graduation im set
i was mostly thinking of some way to make some short term cash
doing 2 jobs is too much effort for upping my monthly income like 2k
or at least IM too lazy to do both
you cant do both
it would be. its a lot of effort and work
so doing this you'd have to be making a good bit more or its not worth it over a regular job
then after graduation youre looking at 10k a month
cause as interns you can make 4k a month
nah mars im talking about its not worth our time to do this
or its not worth any more
within like a year
but then as time goes on we would need to be making 10k a month
so at least 5k a month
see a venture worth doing would have to make more money than entry level intern
not the antivaxxers cause theyre vaccinated
listen their kids are dying
we have to target white supremacists or smth
the antivax market is too small
im just saying the best case kinda sucks
we're talking about a few hundred hours of work and having to make this work long term for the money interns make in 2 months
it gets decently big and only ~5 to split between
and thats best case
thats shit money
even passively
look the real problem is its at best 8k a person a year
gives the money to charities
have you ever used gofundme mars the person setting up the gofundme
for not enough money to make it work
even if its totally passive its like a few hundred hours of work to get going tho
we dont vet shit
i thought the idea was anyone can set up any fund for any reason
this may not be worth the time cause thats kinda shit pay
so this idea is like 8k at best every couple months
so apparently antivaxxer gofundmes were ~80k at most
and your cell for customer support
mars im gonna put your address
no physical service
since again we only offer a site
what stops us from just listing someones home address as the business place
i want you to understand
jett this company is literally never going to make a single cent
moving out to a different state is way more effort
yea i fuckin live here idc about the extra tax tbh
and we just rip off paypal and credit services api
like its not gonna be a heavy traffic site
my plan was we just run this shit out of a garage somewhere
why does it have to be in a different state wtf
laws are ruining this country
tbh id probably actually do this idea if it werent for the complicated legal shit of setting up a business. why cant it just be make a site and take the money
but im not 100%
im pretty sure its legal
and setting up a business
anyway the only part of this idea i cant do myself/with connor and christina is making sure its all legal
these are the dumbest people on earth
get all the antivaxxer's money
take 10% of donations
advertise it as a conspiracy support site
so we start a site that allows any cause to be donated to no matter how dangerous to society or unethical
gofundme just kicked off antivax causes
deadass i have a really good business idea
and either win big or lose
get drunk
we just go there place some autistic ass horse bets
we dont have to be into it 
aight real talk boys who wants to go gamble on horses in arcadia

also ww 2 ad lul
that's a lot of adc buffs for a not-patch patch
&quot;we cant log you in because you may be offline&quot;
wait is anyone elses league offline
me like spooderman
better play league while you can
feelsbadaman
is the sentencing next week
damb
every other role knows the feeling already
most adc players just aren't used to not being the center of attention and having games that are unwinnable
&quot;Normally, an ADCâ€™s role is to carry the mid to late game. If the upper lanes â€˜explodeâ€™, we simply have to lose. (laughs) Iâ€™m going to trust my upper laners.&quot;
its just not better adc stomps the game now
that's the balance teams opinion though and we all know theyre dogshit. the real top players who main the role agree its in a fine spot. mages are viable enough to sometimes show up bot on kr challenger games but real adcs are still meta and still the focus of the game
its just balanced
as I fucking said
adc not a meme
Here's a quick look at the current role diversity of the top 100 of the KR solo queue ladder, it's very similar to Season 8 overall with a slight rise in Mid laners:

21 Top mains

21 Jungle mains

19 Mid mains

18 ADC mains

18 Support mains

The 3 remaining players were playing multiple roles consistently and/or didn't play a large number of games with any champion.

interesting footnote
 me as a local I know how it works and try no to ask for help wish is very sad but the reality of today's society.  Note: but let's  increase the fees and keep the working families out of the parks very sorry.
what a fucking clown
but also it was by Sandeep devmurari
well there was only supposed to be one star full
â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… a month ago
I had not visited this park
yea fuck yosemite
They take your money only to have the waterfalls turned off, I asked to speak to a manager, they lied and told me there wasn't any. Awful. When I asked where the food is sold to feed the animals they told me it was against the rules. They just let the animals go hungry!! SO SAD!
are a special kind of retarded
and national parks
people who leave 1 star reviews on oceans
It was ok I suppose. A but too wet though. I didn't see any sharks from the boat. There was no WiFi and it was just sea everywhere. No whales either.
I wish I were dead.
this is a real big brained human
There's an awesome little zoo in my hometown that's 100% free. They keep mostly rehabilitated local wildlife that can't be released and work hard to provide them with natural habitat and a quality life. They've been consistently expanding and improving this zoo since before I was born and have never charged admission.

Someone complained that they went in July and it was too hot and the animals seemed uncomfortable. In their natural habitat. With optional shelter that they'd chosen not to use.
prophet michael
who saw that one coming
wow
nah sanderson already said he doesn't want to touch asoif
its not on him
so that if/when its not as good
and just have someone else finish the series
grrm is just waiting to die like Robert jordan
even rothfuss is faster
and don't write once they've achieved it
yea i guess im biased against shitty authors that just milk fame and money
fucking play some league
anyway
is fucking dumb
averaging one book every 4 and a half years
^
like if you look at other series there is still conflict at the end of a book that the characters will need to deal with but at least for that moment they've won and if you stopped there youd be reasonably satisfied with the ending
conflict is fine but the way he places it in the books feels like its to force you to continue into the next
and either forces the reader to buy the next book or be left with that unsatisfied feeling
because it doesn't give you room to build them back up or anything
i feel like at no point will you understand that its literally about the fact that its unsatisfying storytelling when you tear down the character at the END of a book instead of in the center like usual
that just reeks of trying to get you to buy the next book
and its left with a cliffhanger
and then she loses everything
danaerys actually has it going on, shits getting better for her right up to the end
and pretty much every book but as an example the first one
not poorly just in a way that isn't satisfying and doesn't make you want to continue
DwD
buy my next book fucker
everything goes to hell
then boom
problems begin to get solved and theres consequences and shit
problems exist
his formula is just
and it just never does
you kind of just read it like &quot;well theres no way it can get worse, it has to get better from here on&quot;
also because as of right now none of the books have endings that are truly satisfying
and never resolve them well
whos able to open up complicated plots
because hes a dogshit writer
but its pretty clear hes struggling like a motherfucker to conclude it
got isn't even done
i was critiquing him as an author based on the fact he sucks at concluding his books
i mean this is the man who made a book about vampires conclude with the epic battle of...staring into each others eyes menacingly
so that his legacy isn't tarnished by his inability to write
so hes riding the money and hoping to die and let someone else finish it
and is now in a corner he cant get out of easily
its pretty clear from that that he didn't plan it all the way through
so now he has to untangle every loose end within them
and promised it would be 7 books
cause he wrote himself into such a clusterfuck
yea hes only taken 2 decades to wrap it up
it immediately comes to mind when i think of shitty story endings
its conclusion was so fucking bad
fevre dream
good build up just to be disappointed at the end
like if you read his other works they suffer from the same problem
and when it does conclude its a far lower quality than the beginning
then takes ages to do so
but also his bigger problem as a writer is he writes himself into situations he cant conclude
he just added 2 factions
its literally called the War of the Five Kings
and copying
theres a difference between adapting
yet worse than either
blended into one
because its almost a blatant ripoff of two sources
ive already been over the literary reasons i don't like it with you
than a lot of their povs
has a better protagonist
a biography about hitler
to the point where you want to skip some of their chapters
its that every character is literally unbearable
parsa idk if youre retarded or what but the point isn't that having multiple perspectives and characterizations sucks
and plot armored to hell
but just kinda lame
not really mary sue
sansa survives through a lot that she probably shouldn't and a lot of people are interested in her and help her out for no real reason
and a cowardly bitch
sansa is somehow both a mary sue
i really like a hundred pages of drudge for the moment or two worth reading
its like man do I read asshole X Y Z and W's chapters so I can get a little bit of side character C that is somewhat likeable
not having any protagonists
and then theres having a full cast of characters that are impossible to root for
theres having good and realistic characters that just aren't likeable because not all people are
it also has really unlikable characters
so it makes the books look better
show was just worse
books were shit too
you don't need anything more than that

that's why i don't really like going home recently
ik
the best of plans
and sell
his current plan is argue until she caves
and my mom thinks the money is worth it
honestly it just comes down to dad doesn't want to deal with tenants for such a small amount of money
and its already more than double what we bought it at
yea but some quick cash now is nice
its just an apartment
and its not like were selling one of the houses
its really shit passive income
but my mom isnt
im totally on board with the payout of selling it
which kinda isn't worth the hassle imo
its like a 3k monthly payment but after taxes and maintainence its only turning like 1200 ish profit
trust me ik
its a shitty fuckin apartment
not in this case
idk i haven't really listened to them
or is gonna be
and rent control is a thing
cause by renting it out you barely make money cause of maintainence and shit
and so theyre divided on if its better to sell it and invest in other stuff
but its at like 800k-900k rn
that's whats going on with it rn
and i kinda want to just yoink it
but at the same time it might
and its not totally out there that a shitty 2 bedroom apartment next to an alley wont appreciate higher than now
tbf rn it is just a housing boom from the fuckin chinese
and its really aids
but my mom wants to just hold it cause she thinks its going to rise higher
and wants to sell our condo
cause my dad thinks the housing market is gonna go down
actually my parents have been beefing it out
just invest in santa monica housing 4head
yea but that's a long time from now
like two months ago or smth
they just released cod
i mean tbh tho its not the worst
lul
you buy now and then they crash again
its actually pretty much half of what it was 4 months ago
peaked october
mars theyre down on the year
that's what i wanted
the lore and story until the end of wrath
turned boring so fast
its just bfa
even now the old school content is so good

they can eat my ass
idc about the money
fuck what they did to wow
activision suck
a lot would just buy it and no dlc
just a few people wouldn't buy the game cause theres too much dlc
you don't lose much either
$$$$$$$$$$
and everything new
keep the roster from 4 free
should've made more of the characters dlc tho
i like that
oh shit 25$ on release dlc
but whatever
it should be higher
yea but if people know this
why tf is their stock so low
wait they did
oof
throw in a &quot;pre order bonus&quot;
nah drop that fuckin on release paid dlc
easy quarter
boom
or online in general
pay to play competitive mode
fuckin items
smash stages
just dlc microtransaction smash characters
fuck that that costs money
either way they need to get their shit together
idk
which i think was eevee?
it peaked the 8th
i would've around a month ago
it dropped like the last few days
no
on the games they could easily do so with
by refusing to turn a profit
and theyre kinda fucking me
sure but i have money in there now
so i can get some fucking money
so yea i do want to see them monetize smash better
ever since feb
its been going down the last half year
is good
and stock values going up
i don't care about the game at all
kind of
to make money
for a more viable and casual competitive
and that Nintendo is better off ditching its hardcore players
just that we aren't really the target audience for most games any more
i didn't say you had to
like fifa
and people like us don't care but a casual market will eat it up
and turns a profit
like apples new phones every year
and just creates shitty yearly versions of it
cause the more likely scenario is someone takes over
or it wont matter to anyone
it wont matter to you
or has it just become a money grabbing machine
and has apple made anything near as innovative as the iPhone
he died
hey milo
steve jobs probably knows a thing or two about tech
just throwing it out there
It turns out the same thing can happen in technology companies that get monopolies, like IBM or Xerox. If you were a product person at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or computer. So what? When you have monopoly market share, the company's not any more successful.
So the people that can make the company more successful are sales and marketing people, and they end up running the companies. And the product people get driven out of the decision making forums, and the companies forget what it means to make great products. The product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies that have no conception of a good product versus a bad product.

They have no conception of the craftsmanship that's required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. And they really have no feeling in their hearts, usually, about wanting to really help the customers.
todays indie startups that make a great game will eventually have their passionate leaders leave and be replaced by corporate machines
fine, they wont exist from big AAA studios
but its gonna be smaller and smaller
theres always a sect of people who just love to make good games
they'll probably exist yea
and the ability to attract a few whales
you just have to make one with a lot of juice effects
see you don't need to make a good game
is going to be a billion dollar game
and are totally fine with micro transactions
a $6 dollar mobile game that caters to a huge portion of china that loves diable
and its a reskin of a different shitty mobile
diablo immortal is going to be a billion dollar game
theres like 50 clash of clans games
summoners war is a billion dollar game
like mobiles
and you get hired based on your ability to produce games that make money
making a good game is second to getting a job
its how the field is taught
its just how it goes
but you can see it in blizzard. they lost their old producers and now they suck
yea cause theyre the ones that care about decent games
nobody here cares about making a good game
Michael its literally my major
and the next gen of game creators is pretty bleak
eventually the people who care about making good games will die
there was a bit of truth tho
im reaaaaaally bored
and ive been writing cheat sheets or taking a midterm since 9am
idk i thought itd trigger mars or smth
and they don't hate that
but its pretty evident in recent years the biggest gaming market is asia
that's true
making characters paid microtransactions
yes but in this case theyre probably losing money because of it
they still exist to create ever increasing profit
stakeholder shareholder
like it fucking should
will finally exist
and the 4fun item competitive mode
or whatever will be out
or maps
probably with paid dlc characters
also itll still be relevant cause ill be right and a completely 4fun smash game
the future of gaming is just microtransactions catered to everyone instead of &quot;gamers&quot;
and people like me will move on into the field
eventually him and his generation will die
neither will last forever
but hey
or as long as Nintendos quarterly is still positive
yea as long as sakurai lives
and ea
but eventually every company is going to go the way of blizzard
yea and that's probably what Nintendo will keep doing for a while
theyre gonna do it
if you can make better money by fucking them and cash grabbing the casuals
the managers dont
the engineers dont
the business people dont
doesn't give a fuck about them
almost everyone in charge of actual game production
and honestly the people that care about making a good smash game and the fans are rare
and they'll need to monetize better
but eventually reality is going to hit them
Nintendo is just slow to catch up because theyre still turning up money in other ways
and your company goes down
otherwise shareholders leave
that's false because capitalism demands you always increase earnings
the shareholders don't give a shit about the game
Edited previous message: the shareholders want money<e_m ts="1544078574" ts_ms="1544078575607" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
the shareholders want monoey
the shareholders own the company
think of it this way
do you know how capitalism works
its literally the moral duty of a company to do all it can to increase its value for shareholders
no the existence of any company is to make money
the reason companies exist
that's literally
and youll have a viable competitive scene
just give the fuckin masses what they want
do you see a pattern here
not if the gameplay is deep and cerebral
if it is popular
the scene is viable
mars
smash has like barely one of those
flashy effects
rng
easy to follow gameplay
it makes shit interesting
people like rng
hearthstone is stupid brainless rng and it makes blizzard money
and a lot of people watch it
cause it makes riot money
its a good fucking scene
and you know what
league has shitty rng and solved gameplay and small viable champ pools
if people don't want to watch it
objectively the mechanics can be fine but your scene is shit
and a small playerbase
no the problem with its competitive scene is nobody watches it and therefore it has tiny prize pools
theyd probably increase viewership too
if they just disable online competitive without items
also
itll just piss off a few neckbeard fucks
its really simple
if they want viewers there which im sure they do
online comp isn't the official competitive scene
like you sponsor tournaments with double the payout
and force them to accept items or move on to a different game
the smart business decision imo is definitely to just crack down on the scene
but they choose not to
they have the power to say fuck you competitive now has items
see that's just a company decision
for like the 95% of the casual fans
cause then itd actually be worth watching
they should just add items to competitive smash
or it will never have great numbers
the problem with competitive mode in a game with multiple mode is it has to be the main game mode
and want a competitive mode
very few players play exclusively aram
numbers wise its probably around 1%
competitive aram when
i mean
will still gravitate to items and away from comp
and therefore the majority of players which are casual
i don't think any kind of gameplay changes will ever make smash more fun without items
and cheese maps
nah the vast majority of players will still just be playing 4fun with items
and your prize pools will be small cause the scene doesn't relate to the majority of players
and therefore your competitive playerbase is small
and so less people want to play competitive mode
the problem with disabling features for competitive is its then by nature less fun
no theres rift and aram
yea but leagues 4fun mode disables features
as long as we disable half the features
5fun games are the future of competitive games
and just prayed to win
and no deck has ever just cast spells and played said card
at no point ever was a pure rng card literally tournament winning
and that has a thriving and interesting competitive scene that hasn't been ruined by its 4fun card design
hearthstone
sounds like
I mean its a competitive game but its also a 4fun4 party game
its genius
in fact, the top players will fly out for 15k prizes so we can jew tournaments out
will be like 50k
and itll be so competitive in fact, that the largest prize pool of all time
lets make a competitive childrens fighting game instead
competitive childrens card game sucks
competitive childrens party game POG

their cc chain was nuts
nah blitz fucked us
and I think its the first one
its gotta be one of the 3
blitz
or hes a d4 player and im like p2 supp
or hes a challenger/master player still and im somehow a god supp
logically hes either a d2 player and I play support at like a d4/d3 level cause he laned a bit better but lost on roams
it is when hes playing vs a plat adc
tbh tho hes the first player we've faced in a hot minute that didn't get dicked in a fair lane
legit d2 player

HMMMMMMMMM
scarra was talking about how the first time people play with him
theyre all starstuck
then the next game theyre just like
&quot;why are you 0/7 you fucknig feeder&quot;
pretty much what we experience
but the first game instead
you guys should play a game of league rq
why would you do that
gdi parsa
eventually
my internet has to come back
milo play some league
cool
my internets out
jk
a game or two
anyone league
literally just bad shen ulti now
yikes they got rid of galio damage reduction on r
Michael I didn't know you went on 4chan
pog
not role hogging
game winning play right here
who isn't an autist these days
autism speaks
is trying to manufacture more girls
pretty sure china
that shit doesn't grow on trees dude
syrup tho
its not worth the effort
white girls are a dime a dozen
were just in it for the money
leave the whites where they are
hell no
we should just take their syrup
why would you want white women
we should invade canada
the cheapest and easiest
no i think that we should stick to one method
to save costs
i think that instead of lethal injection prisoners should be shot
and universally
i think it should be used more
I do believe in it

Economic Left/Right: 2.13 
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: 0.36
but its just the client being dumb
and youre like shit am I banned again
and hear notifications sounds
you guys ever log into league
its like arguing with anti vaxxers
see, nobody wants to argue that because its a moot point
nobody but theres an easier way
jury gay
how about we just play league
and youll be set
either the judge or the lawyer will kick your ass off the jury so fast
and therefore are probable to vote innocent on a guilty man if you think he doesn't deserve it or visa versa
aka youre either racist or know its not illegal to vote against what you think based on evidence
literally all you have to do is say you possess beliefs that would prevent you from making a decision STRICTLY based off evidence
3. still perjury
2. that's perjury
you aren't missing classes on new years eve
as long as you know about what jury nullification is
yea but no lawyer will ever want you on the jury
or that you plan on jury nullification
just tell them youre racist or smth
hahahaha get fucked
and theres full left
theres left leaning
so youre the real fucking liberal
was hoping for right in the center

I just want to play bot with milo and do the degenerate hard shove thing
and go to wahlburger
come to the village
not unless you guys wanna come out to downtown lol
its preseason time
hell no
feelsbadman
you only get one at discount tho
its got 2 out
recently very positive
overall mixed reviews
so I was considering it
its like 75% off
rip
1-10
how is civ 6
if its 15 ill get it
oh wait no they got rid of the improved burn on talisman
I think?
also jg wants the hp
to one fifth
or did it go from like half the turret hp on a charge
did they buff herald too
but my patcher is stuck on 52.8/53.1 MB
I just want to try my degenerate graves tower killing strat
so...fuck you too riot
preseason patch just hit
then again
do you really think valve knows what theyre doing
I guess we're hearthstone now
that shit dumb
how tf are you ever gonna see the back lol
oh wait the icons there
that they said would be in loading screen
and icon
and your ranked armor
wheres the banners
axed half of SKT to save faker
Kkoma is Thanos confirmed
back to silver for you
also the on hit is gutted
that's such a weird combo
and attack speed
who the hell wants armor pen
all the goddamn time
fucking guinsoos nerfs
must be furry
her lore has the word vastaya in it
idk
im tryna fit into our new world furry league
dude riots trying to lock down the furry crowd
and furry shit all over them
then suddenly XD IT WAS ME NEEKO UWU GET ONE SHOT UWU
channel
so you can pick your tank mundo or smth and run in
only q and e
is that her ult channel doesn't break her shapeshift
the only cancer i can see
actually making fair abilities on a new champ
gj rito
yea her w isn't cancer at all
she goes invis half a second
but walks
is just wukong w
wait her w
so actually she has potential
her w has a 3 hit passive
unless her q is like a 3s cd
she doesn't have the dps
theres no way she can jg tho
milo its a new age mage support
is pretty nuts
that bush control
i think she has potential as a support lol
cause youll almost never hit multiple with something that slow
yea
e
so its pretty much a low damage skillshot
and its damage wasn't great on first hit
it looks like it does more damage the more champs it hits
i actually think that w sucks
than the teaser
im more ok with her kit after seeing it
is fucking LONG
also her ult channel time
yea im not sure her kit is inherently as cancer as like zoe or aatrox or pyke
except her engage distance is limited by walls unlike him
yea you just play around her like an amumu lol
but only really short distances
and she can sneak in
cause that ult is fat
it feels like a champ that relieis on the enemy team not communicating
idk
so
but it only walks in a straight line
and on-demand lb clone
new
which isn't anything hew
big aoe ult
q e
e
skillshot damage on q and w
tbh her kit doesn't actually seem that cancer
the q is just a zilean bomb kinda
im watching it
like the page with the abilities listed
where
also you haven't seen the actual kit yet
i think that's less weird
dude I was painting maps at 4am
I got up like 4 times last night

HEY FELLOW GAMERS
hey team
what
GGS FAKER INC
PAID BY STEVE
chameleon rubrik hype
twitch chat misplays in hs
I mean its not super complex either but its twitch chat
so nobody entertaining will want to stream it
so they wont and then wont watch
also like 90% of people wont know whats happening cause they cant play the tutorial unless they spend 20
but half the time I just watch hearthstone while doing other stuff and just listen to the voices and you can tell whats going on off that
I like watching it too when youre full on invested in the stream
so hearthstone gets to live another year or two until the next card game
and on the viewing side most people agree that it sucks
its also the most popular post of all time
this post basically sums it up
so now to play draft you literally have to spend a dollar each time
and then they axed casual draft
like the most hyped mode was draft
which sucks ass
without paying
but you literally cant get cards and basically cant play the game
and random positioning
the random attacks are kinda cancer
tbh the rng is fine its a card game and all
and whatever you got in your starter packs
so if you don't pay you just play casual constructed with premade decks
and you cant play draft in casual either
casual doesn't reward cards
and you can only win packs through pay2play modes
you can only buy cards on the market or through packs
no
can virgil save us from pay2pay2play
can virgil save artifact
since no mans sky
the fastest dumpster fire on a game going public
its literally rng what your shit attacks wtf
fucking shit artifact has SO MUCH rng
they didn't get rid of rng dependence at all
artifact is just hearthstone but complicated
are yall playing that A r t I f a c t
reformed b aby

HONOR @
ALSO WE DID IT BOYS
its good but imo tsujita and shinsengume are better
mars daikokuya is on sawtelle too
idk dunkey made a whole video roasting the story
which is why fallout 76 looks like shit even when its got an engine about as old as red dead
meaning they cant handle stuff like ray tracing or lighting or even detailed texture mapping
you know that Bethesda has notoriously poorly optimized engines
doesn't hair reach a max length though
its long as fuck
I cant even tell if its shorter
like full feminine pull all the tangles out lul
either way your hair is way more styled in hs
a jett
pulling
and making it deep for the camera
or maybe you were pulling a jett
it doesn't lol
just live ones
recording and playback software
which are by definition
both through league voice and skype
normally
no it sounds different and higher
dude why was your voice deeper
you just looked younger
omegalul
also young mars
wtf
theres so many of utis snapchats in here
fucking what
but they choose to do so?
clearly skype can save and recognize png without reformatting
its saved as png
but when you download pictures someone sends you off skype
also why are they saved in png format
but the pictures are ones I sent
no theres videos here that I didn't send
memory bloat
what the fuck is this

Idk. I need to get closer to see their Igns
Kms
Thereâ€™s a live Usc UCLA league match on campus
weren't you going to buy that game
Thereâ€™s a premade in my botlane and I donâ€™t know what to do.

Theyâ€™re playing Sivir Karma and they're already 0-2.

The Karmaâ€™s Using ult wrong and she keeps on missing Q

The Sivir cant farm properly but she says shes diamond 2

Thereâ€™s a premade in my botlane and they don't want to stay

And our midlaner keeps telling them to die and go away

But premade in my botlane just before you go...

Why were going 0-2?

I really want to know.

Thereâ€™s a Rengar in my Jungle and I donâ€™t know what to do.

Heâ€™s ganked our midlane and heâ€™s about to kill amumu

Thereâ€™s a Rengar in my Jungle and I donâ€™t know what to do.

He already got his blue buff and heâ€™s about to take ours too.

Thereâ€™s a Rengar in my Jungle and I donâ€™t know what to do.

Heâ€™s even dived our tower so thats why were 0-2...

Oh premade in my botlane now I do know what to do.

Iâ€™ll fight to save your tower and Iâ€™ll stop you losing blue.

Iâ€™ll try and win top lane so others can fight too.

Oh premade in my botlane I swear it on the stars

The Nexusâ€™s not yet taken and Iâ€™ll make sure itâ€™s not ours.

while your troll ass lissandra and xayah
imagine being a maokai and doing 50k damage
and get in
get on
n i g g e r
you can flame now
its ok the seasons over
no
call the group
how about you just dont
hey buddy
herald needs a large buff or drakes need a nerf
but as it is you still don't get enough out of playing top compared to bot
herald is a dogshit objective meant to make top more appealing to play on before 20 cause otherwise theres no reason to not be bottom
and you get a dragon too
which you can achieve by ganking bot and 3 manning the tower down
half the times its just 1-2k tower damage
and literally cant auto attack it at any point
herald only ends the game at 15 if youre behind as shit
wtf
wait did someone say herald is OVERpowered
also we should find a consistent time
yea I guess im commited to degeneracy
oof
3 hours of gay shit and chester turned sachael into a degenerate
we should just do roughly 3-4
also yea I was burned out after like 3 hours
Douse the Flame of Hope: It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire.
Rule with an Iron Fist: Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow. 
Strength Above All: You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin.
your tenets are actually pretty evil to begin with
eh oath of conquest doesn't matter for alignment
im got stuff to do and this doesn't matter to me
change it
sure
but since his intent was to do good hes not going to view himself as evil
he sees himself as good and acts as &quot;good&quot; when in reality its borderline evil
i made his sheet in his perspective
so i put his alignment as good
you said it right there he sees himself as good
we literally only disagree on how good is judged
i already agreed
like
ok so change my alignment then
we had a majority that said he should die
if you see fit
and i agreed enough to say you can change it
because neither of us is actually listening to the other
we went off the rails enough so ill just roll with anything
change it
whatever
ok
if any of you want to confront him about it that's your choice
hes just going to continue to do what he thinks is right
hes not going to fall on his sword though because of his choices
but because you can only see things from your own perspective
yea and if he were to see himself from a different perspective hed probably think hes evil as well
change it to whatever you want
because he put everyone in danger repeatedly but hey
idc enough anymore
change the alignment to whatever
must be hitler
well shit
good
and did questionable things with the intention of doing goo
man, a nobleman who is used to being the absolute authority made a snap judgement that turns out wasn't perfect
did they declare war on us?
like if muslims in Iraq pary for a storm and a storm hits the US
are not a declaration of war
forces of nature that act in response to prayer
worshipping is not a declaration of war
summoning a kraken isn't an act of war
because we already knew at that point the lizards planned genocide
all he wanted to do was stop a genocide
basically youre looking at it from an objective standpoint and not the viewpoint of intentions
he just didn't have all the information
no he had been given information and formed a conclusion
does that make you evil to make assumptions though
also by source hes closest to lawful neutral. has a personal code but it doesn't swing particularly good or evil
it was to exterminate a village
it wasn't asking us to defeat their warriors
and &quot;all&quot;
it is genocide when you use the words &quot;exterminate&quot;
yes because &quot;we should ally with them to avoid genocide&quot; wont fly with you people
depends if you look at it as intent matters or results matters
the pygmies are only trying to reclaim whats theirs
the lizards went to the pygmies home and planned to kill them all
they only wanted the lizards off THEIR home
yea but they said the lizards had a different home
yes but the lizards clearly stated they planned genocide
and your race isn't going extinct
you weren't in huge danger
i would
yes
lets go kill some pygmies
id be like shit man hell yea xp
yea but do you really think in character
they were going to commit genocide
it only means you have personal lines you wont cross
lawful doesn't mean you follow the laws of the land or kingdom or anything
that you wont break
no law requires you follow a code of ethics
how does that work
but the actions are evil
and your intentions are good
why not? if youre acting with the knowledge you have
or led them away from the group
i would've said i was the only survivor
and hes getting eaten by an octopus
if we wake up
because it sure as fuck looks like he led the octopus to us
and leading the octopus to your allies
leading the fucking lizards to your allies
but i strongly disagree
i mean if you say so
literally leading the genocidal lizards to our camp
the octopus monster
the lifeboat fiasco
we kept ending up in trouble
is that whenever he was around
cause in character all we know
he was not innocent
i don't think so
is it evil to dispense justice
he left people to die because of what he did
more than twenty people
that's the definition of selfish and evil
he cut the line before it could be filled
bringing the lizards to us
bringing a monster to camp
abandoning your comrades on the boat
hes not innocent
and if nobody else will do what has to be done to improve our chances of surviving
he just showed again and again hes a liabilty
youre forgetting i was the one willing to heal him back to life in the first place
we gave him so many chances too
everyone else awoke to a monster and him being in a place we told him not to return to
and in character only you knew that he wasn't responsible for the monster showing up
by coming back he put us in danger
i said &quot;so what if hes unconscious&quot; because we literally awoke to him being devoured while in the camp he wasn't supposed to be in
we have no way to imprison him and ensure he doesn't keep putting us all in danger so the only choice is to kill him for the good of everyone else
letting him live is the real injustice
so what if hes unconscious hes still repeatedly put everyone in danger
it kind of looks like he ran into the monster and brought it back to us
and a monster was on him
even after being told not to return without information
i woke up to him back at camp for whatever reason
I mean in character we don't know what happened
chester said he would go explore and in the morning we find him at our camp having done nothing and brought an octopus monster upon us
that the plan was to leave
I explained to him straight
and then ran out
I never said that I was going in
he was a coward and a liar
he really did
youre not subhuman
as long as youre ahri &gt; kaisa at the bottom
so
and her aesthetic is more high class and refined
i really like the fur thing
alucard aesthetic tho
is a better aesthetic imo than the spraypaint and neon
but eves shades and car
yea clearly its ahri kaisa last
Eve &gt; akali &gt; ahri &gt; kaisa
his friends are currently flaming him for it
what a fucking degenerate
also connor thinks that Akali &gt; ahri &gt; kaisa &gt; eve

didn't you read his message
no he got burned in the fire and died
like the incel you are
call them femoids
Edited previous message: who the fuck calls women the fairer sex<e_m ts="1541701539" ts_ms="1541701540798" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
you fuckin white knight
who the fuck calls femoids the fairer sex
fake and gay
oof
and the autistic smash bros fucks
like you have the autistic fucks that watched all those shows
like pow(anime, smash) = mega autism
so its doubly retarded
see this one has smash mixed into it
what the fuck is on your car nathan
everything else is stale af
like the animeme meta is a daily shift and like a big monthly change
cause then you learn stuff about anime
which is pretty gay
is anime memes
tbh all most innovative circle of memes
no memes are truly timeless
all memes are made for an era
every meme is normie when youre a degenerate
you gotta talk to your dealer
if your shits too normie
you may just not be looking at the right ironic memes
that sounds like auto response
the autistic shit you do
and the set of responses to said string
you feed it messages as strings
the algorithm is simple
yea exactly
skype probably has been fed shit data for years and years
finding good data is hard
machine learning is easy
 and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
have a hat on
why tf that bitch akali
you right
is she their new oc hots universe
what game is orphea even from
no, hearing you or reading your words deteriorates my mental
grabbing the trophy bases so you could collect the enemies was the shit
that shit was the best part of brawl
wtf do you mean subspace emissary was a disaster
this meme dumb af
jett probably
i swear at some point you've said those words
&quot;I never jack off cause jett's always home&quot;
this should be normal for you
milo didn't you say you never jack off
new liss passive
was he the white blonde kid
whos mike meers
&quot;she&quot;
There can be no hope in this hell, no hope at all.
that's p gay
The mind cannot hope to withstand such an assault.
lmao nah im just hoping someone at riots feeling generous and releases that last checkpoint day before season ends
but maybe theyre wrong lul
youll get it
and if you have x honors and no valid reports
is that every week and a half to two weeks riot releases a new checkpoint
maybe but the most popular theory for how it works
I barely miss it
so unless they shorten the next checkpoint release from a week and a half to a week
what a meme I just got honor 1-3
does that make you double gay
what if youre one of those people with like XXY
hype
Riot said fuck no nut November and so did I 
I stand by it 
Hey it is
Akali rap ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Apparently it was a one day beta
Wait wtf

High School Students? More like ______.Ouija says: TARGETS
cause theyre dogshit
and just ruin games
its almost like riot wants me to stay gold
idk decay is op
im actually hard smurfing wth
fuckin faggots
who doesnt
but hey
nah he does crack
everyday bro
yea and just like dom I do crack
im failing Saturday afternoon
is because why the fuck would you
see the reason not to do no nut november
get me out
aight cool
I got plans
im fine with that
just cause I don't want to participate in no nut november
nah
yea fuck you what the fuck is this shit
I didn't accept this
is a farce
so however I got my scenario
and theres a huge inconsistency considering in no case was I challenged nor did I challenge
listen im not reading your 180 messages
to the random passerby
but if you challenged me then I guess your challenge is to go on the promenade and spread your love of traps
no
before I acquired this 30 top game challenge
then I should have had to challenge someone
if the challenged gives a challenge to the challenger
your rules are inconsistent
well I didn't challenge anyone then
2 are mars and david who apparently were challenged
theres 4 people without
he shouldn't have one on him
but if nobody challenged milo
yea I know
on the doc
whys he have something by his name then
its only you and Michael I think
milo got challenged
its only the other 1
that isn't blood related to you
like shit a suitable challenge for you would be having to have a single conversation with a woman
not even yourself
nobody wants that pencil dick
parsa you literally didn't have anyone challenge you because we all know its too easy for you
im lookin to smash
nah this challenge dumb as shit
fuckin loser
I think hes the only one then
wow. parsas so lonely nobody challenged him
his name is empty on the doc
can I challenge mars then
anything keeping milo inside is easy enough for him
after you fail
milo your challenge should be you either get shrooms or go to the gym daily for the rest of the month
so spooky
oooo
milo has to play dota
what are these pussy challenges
aight well who challenged who
that doesn't make sense
or is it just like not at all
is no nut November like no fap where you can get a girl to get you off
yea but whats this challenge shit
what the fuck is going on
Edited previous message: <e_m ts="1541036910" ts_ms="1541036910264" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
no I can smurf it
team anyway tho
faker is trash
theshy is trash
everyone is trash
who even added you back
we should go shake kids down for candy
are we doing shrooms on halloween
nobody wants to buy a shitty console just to play one game
mars that's a hard &quot;might&quot;
play through it and tell me if anything crashes
milo get on disc
don't ever add that retard faggot back
How can you play that bad and be allowed to stay
They grouped as 4 and took 2k+ damage from a single aatrox q
They should be removed from the lcs for that fucking embarrassment
G2 is the most boosted worthless team to play in worlds 
Wunder out here taking Worlds Ender seriously with his meme performance
<ss type="puke">(puke)</ss>
Almost 5
Fucking Jayce out damaging 4 people combined
G2 literally first time on the rift
Banning adcs is dumb
Aatrox awful pick
Big brain cancel jhin ult by running at him
Is Jayce
Wait what the fuck
It's almost like they should've drafted a winning top so he couldn't long schlong them
Beats aatrox and irelia down like it's nothing
Chad as fuck 1v2
Shy is a fucking monster
PERKS INTED ALREADY WOO
Draft winning matchup ffs
All losing lanes again tho
At least their draft is better over all
Better ban adcs against the team with the two best solo lanes
3 adc bans 
Oh boy 
They're just looking to play fortnite at this point
...
Ecks dee jhin into lb
Lose lane
Aka
He's a skill lane early
Why pick aatrox
But at least not kaisa 
Well they banned xayah again
All tournament
Literally inferior sivir
She's been such a trap pick 
-5 /10 on that kaisa ban
0/10 would not fucking ban xayah
Awful draft and boosted pussy play
Coach deserves a lot of blame for that game
Why the fuck are you banning adcs
And ban akali
For a buff that he saw get taken
You have to keep the initiative and fucking micro your jungle so he's not boosted enough to run top to bottom over wards
This wait and scale shit didn't even work for Korea
Draft better. You have the worse players so draft winning lanes
Yea but they can control it
Except adc but he couldn't do anything
Literal dog shit from every member of g2
So he gave up half a jungle early
He saw the J4 bot and still didn't steal blue
Yea what the fuck was jankos doing
They lose series 0-3 unless they decide to not be worthless in solo lanes
Dogshit play from g2 solo lanes. Fucking geed laners vs chads
Is an embarrassment 
To fucking akali 
Swain
Also losing as swIn
Fucking EU special
Give 100% pick/ban champ to enemy team. Draft losing matchup against best mid in the tournament 

???

Lose
Cause heâ€™s a cocky boosted piece of shit
Perkz decided to give rookie the winning matchup 
CAN'T HAVE PLAYED BAD IF WE NEVER PLAYED AT ALL :thinking:
Lose 
...
Draft 3 losing lanes
The Tsm classic
lmao he got banned
go pm him
you ape
the implication here is he wont read this chat

fuck me
guys the xayah rakan bracelets are 75 bucks
cursed_ouija
My sister is down since her miscarriage. To cheer her up I'll get her ________Ouija says: PREGNANT
lmao
or like an affidavit saying shes a virgin
you fucking went and got her std checks
look for one of those
like theres girls who just never get it
especially since on birth control its not always every month
i feel like its not that huge a deal to fuck her on her period
go to the gym or this will be you
eh you aren't missing mucj
so he can cervix punch bitches
jets going to the gym
well you aren't doing it hard enough then
definitely not normal
only fucked her in the pussy once
probably lol
.
she was the one i tasered
eh i had an ex into that kind of stuff
all short girls do anal
which is why they say
when you date 5 ft Asian girls
but sometimes its inevitable
i mean yea it is
and say it was her
you do it too
and when she screams
like your dick punches it
just fuck the bitch so hard you hit the cervix
like
hoo-ah
i thought it was more hoo-a
you ever hear the phrase &quot;small girls all do anal&quot;
lmao F
real talk though sometimes you just  feel bad for her you know
big brain plays
and you can do whatever you want
again just bring a taser
F
0/10
worst position
the one where shes just spasming
thats the best position
while you fuck her
you ever taser a girl
why would you even do that
that's weird
mars has standards
like shit
and fat dudes
even fat bitches have standards
how degenerate do you have to be to not care about looks
and doenst care how the dude looks
i think the real point of this discussion is Michael wants to get fucked
stop
you have issues
what the fuck is a straight gay
david youre gonna catch hands if you change that title again
is the claim that girls and girly gays don't care about looks
like i don't understand what youre trying to say
so therefore all gays care about looks
women care about looks too
you know
cause
wouldn't they still care about looks
so if youre saying gay bottoms are women
ok so if the tops are the straight guys they care about looks yea
???????????????????
im sure gays do too
guys care about attractiveness
what the fuck are you talking about
have you heard of punchr
hes speaking from experience
he is gay
and get paid for it
kill them
rape all their women
take all their shit
you know just pop into some African village
also do you guys ever wish you could just be like a sailor in the 1600s and just raid settlements and murder them all as a job
and it wont mean shit
or a 10
you can be a 0 like qt
for male streamers
at all
matter
looks literally don't mater
its almost like
hmm
while being a pro player
still 1k average viewers btw
kappa fucking pride
and like the fucking rock
literally top 50 in the game he plays
ok bajheera swole as shit and has not that many viewers
yea qt might have less viewers cause he'd have less meme value
but if youre saying looks are important those people never had huge streams as pro players
but as a pretty boy kpop type
so was flame at one point
helios was pretty good looking
cause Michael said there arent
no were trying to point out theres attractive league players
where a bunch of thots just gush
and theres at least one &quot;appreciation thread&quot; a year about him
kobe was a pro too
its deficio
and youre trolling if you say hes not attractive
this man was a pro league player
michael
so  you get all the kids in their streams
and like girls
because their viewers like watching people in their elo
i think that a lot of girls get big followings at lower skills like poki or lily
and at that point skill and personality dominate
attractiveness &gt; else up to a point
which just isn't true
i thought it started cause he said poki was popular cause shes diamond
mars no you cant
you probably wont get more views than if youre challenger skill
as opposed to if youre challenger looks
but if youre diamond in looks youll get views
if youre just diamond it doesn't mean shit
when youre top of the top
skill is only more important
up to a point
also I thought the point was that attractiveness &gt; skill
90% of her streams are solo and without
im pretty sure she has a friend do her makeup
which are pretty rare
no I said she wears a lot on specific days
without makeup
but most are just sporadic streams
and has makeup on
she either has planned streams with people
nah she wears it every few streams
shes kinda the only one tho
lily is pretty big and doesn't wear makeup
like shroud
its all you need
but if all you have is skill but you have a shit ton of skill
cause you don't need a ton if you have other aspects
skill is super hard to place
but much harder for them to get a huge following like qt or shroud
yea so its easier for women to get that medium following
most women have like 100-500 viewers
cause theyre less popular overall
its easier to get a few fans as a woman but none of them ever become huge
fewer stream but if its easier to be popular as a woman youd expect more of them at the top
like ninja, shroud, dr d, qt
if that's true why are all the most popular streamers male
and fed
same as lily
poki is definitely popular by personality and looks
unless theyre shroud or smth
mostly though I don't think people watch streamers for gameplay
and he does decent
also his single player streams of like assassins creed and shit are all at hardest difficulty
in which hes legend with dumpster tier decks
yea but he mostly streams hs
toast is actually good at hearthstone
like a fucking gremlin
now she just does music streams
lily used to stream in more makeup
also lily wears like 0 makeup most streams lol
I don't think anyones watching her for gameplay
but shes fucking bad
not as many
who is both
mars being the mythical leader
the dynamic is just retarded and gay
shes been streaming longer than that
so like 3 seasons ago
in my yasuo spam days
yea we did she was lux
and I dicked her
nah we played against her that one time
only thing is she had a thousand game
or diego
like shes mechanically the same as like milo
and like a bad d3 at that
she was d3
poki wasn't d2
that's the moral thing to do

If you ask a complicated question out of their program they just freeze up and get confused
Milo normies are the npcs of real life 
Exactly
Cause all the cops see him from a distance and close in rn
Milo just wants to be allowed shirtless in public
and dueling
zac trash tier clear
rip
but like most jgs don't talk so you just have to understand the pathing theyre thinking
etc
or &quot;cant fight early, ward bot crab so i can sneak top one&quot;
like i usually just say &quot;i can duel early, im contesting bot side crab&quot;
mid has to know the jg matchup unless the jg tells them though
in which case theyre not going for crab anyway
yea unless your jungler is trollpick
crab starts to be contested around 2;10
buff-&gt;camp clears at 2:03
which is ample time to clear the crab
it lasts till 220
nah you can drop it 1:20
is cause theyre forced to ward the other entrance
the big reason junglers have to blind the crab
i mean you could just...ward the river bush
all riot has to do to fix that is make krugs give level 3 again reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
of seasons 3+
this is like the insightful summary
and adc was always support reliant
mid jungle have always been heavily reliant on each other
the only time its not on you in the jg is if your mid is straight afk and theirs is challenger roam god 69
so every game comes down to am i better than theirs
i mean i play jg
and the games that don't are equally likely across all times of day
like most games feel winnable and decided by how i play
i guess. tbh idk if it makes that much difference though
so its more likely people dc to eat
cause its east coast 3-6
i personally like the noon-3 ques
tbh I don't mind having worse teams cause all I do is try to 1v5 regardless
or better teams and better enemies
worse teams and worse enemies
que time depends what youd rather have
that's pretty good
hey
whats in the deceit update
and itll need to be restarted
or youre a retard
and if it says &quot;use magic&quot; dont
let me know if theres typos or any shit
play my game
hey faggots
dude you gotta get your gains started in the fall so when summer comes around you can vanquish the thots with your built muscles

Citizens of NA! Raise your eyes to the skies and observe!

Today our region's destruction has been averted in defiance of our very makers!

Afreeca Freecs, herald of Korea, has been defeated by our brave comrades C9 in the depths of the Korean city of Busan. Afreeca was sent here to judge the fate of our region. It found a region whose teams had deviated from the Koreans' blueprints . A region where not everything has gone according to plan. Cold logic deemed our region not worth saving. Cold logic, however, does not account for the power of Sneaky in lane.

It's up to each of us to prove this is a region worth saving.

That our teams... our teams are worth cheering.
FOR MAKING NA MOTIVATED
TY FORTNITE

&quot;Oh boy here I go getting raped again whee&quot;

no goblin slayer
damn. couldn't get one nigger in there first?&gt;
do you have a full squad of all torch-afflicted level 6 heroes
did you beat the darkest dungeon yet
im reformed
boys I hit honor checkpoint 1
same but tbh game &gt; midterm
fuckin normies
Michael and milo are on league
yo are we deceit boys
*get on
so you guys wanna flame some kids

We found Michael's girlfriend's reddit account
I've [19F] been seeing this guy, Michael [19M], for a few months now and I found out at the weekend he has a micropenis. He told me early on he had a small dick and so we took things slowly. I saw it for the first time on Saturday and it's about 2-2.5&quot; long. He was really uncomfortable so I only saw and touched it for a minute until he put his boxers back on. He cried after that and I didn't know what to say so I just hugged him and then we went to sleep together.

I really like him as a person and want to stay with him and help him with his insecurities but I've never dealt with something like this before. What can I say or do to him that will help his confidence without seeming to emasculate him?

EDIT 1: He's 2.5&quot; erect.

EDIT 2: I'm going to bed now so I'll reply in the morning and then talk to my boyfriend about how we can deal with his insecurity together.
yo are we team for deceit tho
not really
milo you don't need to aim in deceit
same
are we deceit boys
need 2 for the full 6
we've been over this
jump off the roof
if you want to oof
like at all
downtown
that's not
are you gonna shoot mars up
why are you downtown
according to votesrs
in the country
best Mexican restaurant
Koreans gay
Japan &gt; south korea
If you want to oof, jump off the roof
thank you friend
because dota and hots werent enough
ah yes. just what i was looking for. a moba worse than league
lul
ye
deceit
any bois want to try deceit
lul
 fuckin wildcard worlds?
which makes it league but not aids
its free and can take up to 5
deadass tho we should try deceit
@Diego
that was offensive to the gay we have
no bigoted slurs in my chat
gtfo with your absolver shit
D E C E I T
no fuck absolver
lets play some deceit boys
ah fuck I was at the gym
that isn't league
new multiplayer game
so how is their program responsible for the second loss
which means we need to talk about your mmr lol
but it sounds like you lost 30lp after one bug
like sure glitches are aids and all
that's also a separate problem
if it bugged one game and then you went to try another
Edited previous message: you got other problems anyway<e_m ts="1538345339" ts_ms="1538345340126" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
you got other ptoblems anyway
if youre losing 30 lp for a single game
hold up
ree
I have no food
or both
I think its one of you two
that's 2 to 1 odds that someone is
statistically theres likely to be at least one

10%, 10 people in here. Whos the one with 83 IQ
Bronze will be 'you're just bad at the game'
Iron will be 'you're actually awful at basic things and don't know what the fuck you're doing'
~10% of the population has an IQ under 83, which is the point the US military won't recruit people because they literally can't train them to do anything useful. And in the grand scheme of things, LoL is a pretty complex activity, even at a basic level.

After watching this convo about the new rankings, I actually feel kinda bad about them adding a new tier below Bronze. Just when they thought &quot;hey, at least i can only go up from here!&quot;
whos gonna come farm tokens
so I bought a worlds pass
Do it or pussy 
Across lab computers and mine
Also Milo Idk. I tried it with 7zip and it works each time
And the shrine you can gain health lose hope, nothing, or gain hope lose health
You always kill the bear you just take more damage based on choices
There will be a health and hope bar on the next one
it
also fucking play
that shit gay
don't install winrar
also its a .rar but 7zip will open it
its the next orca slapping shit gif
oh yea I saw that
idk why she set the other one to private
good
what about this link
lol
cause Christina owns the other one
weird. im just reuploading it then
but my partner changed it or it bugged during build?
it should look like this
idk what happened to the shrine scene tho
bless
I actually have a game prototype now
download build.rar and run the windows executable
and parsa left
is that why we started winning when I was jg
and that the only metric is training and breeding
meaning it has no inherent power
but then someone believed in the pokemon and lost
yea but who wins
and their pokemon
but they both believe in themselves
what happens if two people battle
where are you
team

but Id already taken one of izoldis
I usually screenshot their character bios when I update them
yea
The thing parsa makes deals with. l u l
&quot;Wretched thing, I am the one that watches from the shadows, the one that sends shivers down your spine. You, like all things, know my name, and know to fear. I can feel it dripping from you, the dread that leaks as my talons graze your flesh. So supple and palpable, like mother's milk. Can you feel it too? My ternary tongue dragging its way slowly across your throat, its lingering touch burning like hot coals. Look into my eyes, little one, can you see how closely we are bonded? How close we have always been? All your life you have awaited me, felt me in the darkness where light dares not touch. You've been here before you know. Feel my tendrils as they coax the flesh, feel that involuntary tremor of ecstasy and terror. Feel as they bore beneath the skin, like ants crawling while you shiver the sensation away. I am in your mind, the inexplicable thoughts. You feel yourself remembering times and places you know you've never seen, but I have. The voice that tells you kill because nobody will know, that you should be in charge, that he is weak and unworthy. I hear it too, every moment of my existence I hear it. It pains you to think such thoughts, makes you ill to the core. I am there now, my quintuple maw pushing through your intestines. You can't even breathe without my permission, a single twitch out of line and your internals will be ruptured on my bone growths. We are so intimate, wouldn't you agree. I could stay like this forever, just the two of us. Every thought, movement, sensation of yours dictated by me for eternity. I feel that thought of death squirming up you know. There's no need to be so naive. I'd only bring you back. Why would you want this fun to end? I do so enjoy pulling every nerve of your brain like a fiddle. Plink, pain, twang, agony, I am a musician without equal aren't I. So much raw emotion in my works. Ah, I wouldn't try that if I were you. Any hope, any resisting, and I pull the reigns harder. Let us see if you can make it through the first movement shall we. A slow, soft dance, one that you should remember not to participate in. We wouldn't want my tendrils to accidentally gnaw your veins apart, would we? Ah, see, you spasmed there. It will feel like a century, my friend. Time dragged on so slowly as I feed the impulses of pain to your nerve cores just so they never dull to much or overlap too high. Perpetual pain, an entire lifetime's worth. Maybe by then you will have learned to remain still when told to. Impressive, you endured the whole thing without additional movement. Now then, shall we begin the piece? Yes, I see that thought of submission in there. You do well and truly surrender and swear undying loyalty. We shall see about my mercy after this concert. Concentrate on your feet, you'll feel my lashers deep within them, a dull pain as muscles are forced apart by their burrowing. Was that almost a scream of pain, did you feel as they broke your big toe to splinters? I will allow that one, as it was the first fragment to be extruded from your flesh, but you must get accustomed to the feeling. Each inch of bone shatters into forty-one splinters after all, and we have many to go. By the end of this, you'll look like an adorable little Spikehound. Oh right, your world has no such things. Imagine a boneless lump of flesh with every inch of it protruding small sharpened bone. In your case though, I will keep the skull intact. It'll be easier to rebuild you as my servant that way. Oh, I felt that one myself. A nasty break the shin is. The flesh there is tough and the splinters take a lot of force to push through it. Don't worry, you'll thank me when I shatter your thighbone and it takes minutes to push each fragment out. By then, you'll be so used to it I may have to start rotating the pieces to get you to really feel. Well, since I can feel your thoughts, I know you no longer hear me my friend. I shall leave you to the care of my appendages. We shall see each other in a short decade or two for you to swear fealty. I do so look forward to it; there is not greater pleasure in life than turning enemies to friends, and then to servants.&quot; - Izoldi's words, spoken to the Dwarf, Thurgden. Pieced together by Aomilya Whisperwood in the 7th year of the First Cycle when she came upon him in his distress. Passed through the ages to all Alfkayn, this excerpt is one of our most important Recordings. Without it, those who are reborn would never comprehend the cruelty of the Enemy, not why he must never be allowed to wake. (Annotation by Vividal Stormchaser)
it was ching chong retard

p3 games are awful tho
I think it only skips when you pass series or get into one now
which is where most wrs tank
theyre retarded and wont let you skip g1 series
but also
my guess would be that if he keeps the wr then when he passes p5 series itll jump him to p3
and I didn't skip until getting through plat5
with that same mmr
like I had an 80% or smth from g4-g1
you have to have like 75%+ wr through 2 or 3 divisions to skip
burn the ethots
call a locksmith so he can unlock it in 2 seconds while somehow breaking the lock then charge you 5x the quote
even if you call AAA aren't they just gonna pry the window anyway

If she breathes, shes a_______

Ouija says: live

I don't care what the title is
title

changing
stop
youre autistic

yea
plus however long you want to play the games
so roughly 10 hours of building
but the piano is the longest
and theres 6 things
we built the piano in 2 hours
if it was like 40 bucks it would be
not like. actually worth
nah. its a meme but its fun
its valuable cardboard
and a fishing rod

it pops up notifications
stop changing the title
fuck that shit
like I was gonna go but then its a fucking raffle
wait its not even guaranteed
some people are into that
youtube titties is a subreddit i think
so they sent him an empty log for his ban report
but the system didn't process him the one before
like the guy who got banned after saying nothing in a game
auto flagged for kys, was already on the shit list for another game, then they logged this one
probably both tbh
or they auto flagged him for kys
they just give you a default ticket for the game before the system gets you
it was probably for a different game
don't call us again
fuck you nigger
wouldn't you take a few seconds to scrub it clean
I mean if someone came at you with the dumbest, most irrational argument of all time and kept changing your titles so you had to see it
theyre jewing us for coins now
I guess. they used to be free when we were in high school tho
but having to eat shitty food
like how is it worth saving a few dollars
and how many can you really eat anyway
but pancakes elsewhere aren't that expensive either
ok
and their butter sucks
ihop pancakes are like rubber
and its not even by a small amount
no they definitely taste better at other places
you gotta be drunk af to go to ihop
eat decent food instead of processed cancer
plat btw
cause shitty players need a champion they can play
and why tank meta should never come back
is why conquerer was released
this shit
fuckin faggot
Michael lives in some reverse world where traps are straight and normal girls are gay
yea that's all I care about
r is like a diana dash
but slow
e is lee q
q is bad talon w
she has such shit abilities its kind of funny
so when she sucks ass on release its ok
at least new akali is thicc as hell
that's like 90% of the fun/good champs
old r &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new r

Having dark skin.
Being elderly.
Being overweight or obese.
Not eating much fish or milk.
Living far from the equator where there is little sun year-round.
Always using sunscreen when going out.
Staying indoors.

Dude you can steal and resell their stuff as vintage tho
Fuck you
Fuck them it's a group chat
No he said he was fae
And I want that confirmed
Because I'm pretty sure bast is a demon
Idk. I like the current timeline where he's an innkeeper more
He kept visiting Imre looking for her for months
That was the big Ew
Kvothe is also a creepy fucker who stalked a girl across the continent
It's a narration device
He's always above average but never the best except he tells the story as if he was
Yea but not in the way fela or elodin or any of the other masters could
Consistently. Nah
He couldn't find wind
Fela found the name of stone
He couldn't find a patron but claims he was best in house
That's cause he's yet telling the story. He lost to Devi but talks more about how he beat his classmates
He's just consistently good enough
He's aight as a musician but not the best
He's aight. Hes not a great arcanist but he's good
Honestly I just want to know where he found bast 
Idk. I'm not sure what a maer is
But kvothe thunder fuck just can't keep it shut
Stapes was one of two people who probably shouldn't own a silver ring
No they gave him gold because they knew he was closer to the maer than they were
Yea. I liked stapes. He owned significant land apparently
Stapes was a commoner
And kvothe still fucks up his own social standing after that
Stapes has a bowl of gold from barons and lords 
Stapes gave him a silver ring and a bone one. All he had to do was not massively fuck up
And then tossed it away
Idk it gets old tho. Especially with how lucky he was
And generally being the poorest fucker around his friends
And Stapes
Or the wife
Like trying to fuck with Ambrose 
Also his problems are 90% social ineptitude
Instead of starting 
Yea but that book ended with it
Like the University bits are the best
It's got the inverse Stormlight effect on me. It starts slowing after the maer
I feel like the first half is way stronger tho
Also mars I reread Wise man's fear. It's much better second time
League of tower defense
Can't go wrong with it
On every jungle
Actually there is. Banner first item
And you get more value out of Hurricane
Rfc is overkill since she kites well and doesn't need to start far
As her AA range goes up she's able to hurricane farther targets
It does
Yea but she builds 2
Both those are worse since you're not using her extra long range to get triple procs off her on hits
That's why you get botrk and a zeal item
You still need AS. She's still an adc
Any good kindred goes on hit now
You can't go crit since the item update
You do know hurricane is her best AS item
Let's find out 
Are traps gay tho
This won't fix it
It's like a band aid on a stab wound while they wait for the rework paramedics
I feel like they did nothing
Her build hasn't changed either. It's still warrior botrk hurricane cleaver ga 
What am I missing here. 15 damage on e and a revert on a nerf
They just gave her machete as back
That's better
Who keeps changing chat title to the same thing. Get creative
Emergency exit row &gt; first class apparently
The one time I have enough leg room to full stretch and I'm too tired to stay up and appreciate it 
On the way. About to board
I used to have to pay for that
And no passport at the gate
Also they updated security. No laptops out or shoes off 
Day or night. It's so weird
Dude it's always the same lady on emerald card
I need an ocean to get away
Yea mars I'm escaping from people taking demon deals and backing out, along with attempted murder and other pettiness lol
It's been the same ones since I was in middle school
Also is it weird I recognize the baggage check ladies
Airports gay 
that's too wholesome wtf
are any of you jews
it wasn't cause it was a retarded penis picture
and I thought it was an invite to a channel or smth
some fucker messaged me it on league
you know where I found that
but if its just you im gonna be disappointed
ill fucking do it
legit tho
but im gonna go there and find out
diego idk whos at your house
or the H and A keys
I don't think diego has a working shift key
who even are you
I don't get whats wrong in that pic
also isn't kotone illegal
either your schitzo is acting up or you need to stop letting marisa on your pc after the deed

high school gayla
hows the gala
Toplane: The emo/dropout/druggy/or depressed oldest kid. They've shut themselves off from the rest of their family. Frequently emotionally hardened from years of neglect, they feel like it doesn't matter how well they do, because the other two kids get all the special treatment. Rarely, they'll get a side business (probably drug dealing) going and pull through in their family's time of need. Mostly, though, they feel like their family doesn't even remember they exist.

Jungle: The breadwinning mom or dad. They work 9-5 in the jungle and come home to help raise their kids. They're stretched way too thin all the time and at least one of their kids will think they're being neglected. If they stay at work extra long, they might get to complete an extra project for a bonus, but that'll probably go unnoticed by their family. There's stiff competition too, and they might get fired if they exhaust themselves too much. They have to forgo meals sometimes to feed their kids. They also have to have a crab for breakfast, or they starve to death.

Midlane: The middle kid. They're convinced they are the most talented person in the family, and they should be getting all the special treatment. Occasionally, they're right. Sometimes they come with their breadwinning mom or dad to get on-job experience and blueberry snacks, and sometimes they lose it all to a bully on the way to show off in front of their younger sibling.

adc: The youngest kid. They're really good at exactly one, fortunately lucrative, thing, but they're also a bit special-needs and require tons of expensive training and time to get proficient at it. It takes a long time, and a lot of effort, but they might come through in the end if you put it all in. Or they might try to eat an entire can of paint and die.

Support: The stay at home mom or dad. They're working full time trying to keep the youngest from accidentally killing themselves. They get little to no pay, are constantly about to panic, and it's warrented, because whenever they turn their back for 2 seconds to ward, their kid has run straight into the middle of the road.
cause apparently I get 250% more staying cool honors
or the system doesn't know math
either the average player is a salty 250% of their games
even with retard passive and ie interaction
trynd still sucks tho
yasuos not bad since he counters a lot of meta champs

what now retard
it wouldn't double his passive crit huh
who fucking said
Hey jett
If you buy Infinity Edge on Tryndamere , and have 100 Rage you will have 70% Crit Chance.
Infinity Edge doubles crit chance , so with 35% Crit from Passive turns to 70% , pretty cool to go as a first item , the problem is that IE is a bit expensive (2BFs+1.1kgold)
shouldn't it have been yesterday
when is the league patch?
fallout seventy sucks
im gonna do it rn
fuck them
i could've flamed so much harder shit
wait I thought that was already included
ez
you get tired and sleep
?
is this
what the fuck
hey
Yo jett. Happy birthday
diego in the red
diego wtf is this
feelsbadman :gun: as clash is ends, so does my life feelsbadman :gun:

no
league
thats all you need

nigga that's gay
I feel like we hit a record level of autism in this chat just now
omegalul
food is a better pastime than anything else tho
also mars if you play wow tell me
another 0/5 enemy jungler lul
soloq norms is just a fiesta every time
league is fun idk what you guys are on about
we can get food
also if anyone is in sm
its not like we have to play something together every day
for years
like weve been
or you know we can continue playing normals
just kidding soloq is better than that shit lul
we can all play maplestory2
hey you know what
id play their multiplayer
wut
start of expac is always chaotic tho
wows pretty good rn since its end of expansion catchup time
oh i thought you meant multiplayer darksouls
mars you know i was being sarcastic about that right
ill keep that in mind
definitely a good multiplayer game
of which league is by far the best game
of which theres basically league, fortnite, and dotes
so if youre all a bunch of cheap fucks that leaves only f2p games
that's less than lunch costs
15 a month
wow man
fortnite lul
dotes is ass
nobody wants WoW
i tried to get us all terraria
what else do you want to play together
which pretty much means its just not fun to play
either in terms of time or fairness
sure, but few people playing a multiplayer pvp game does mean it has serious issues with matchmaking
i think mars is in the minority that would play a new game and enjoy getting shit on the majority of matches
maybe
everything else is just means to an end
the goal of any pvp game is to win
cause half the fucking time i want to play online im against people 4-5x my playtime
like armello sucks
and if matchmaking sucks its just not fun to get into
that's the nature of it
yea and since its small matchmaking will always suck
decent matchmaking is basic as fuck
not the only one
yea cause that's the baseline requirement to pickup an online game
and you feel like matches are fair
where your wr is going to be at least close to even
when you can just play any of a thousand other games
so why pick up a game and have a shitty time losing
which is pretty clear by the fact 90% of the initial players left
nobody wants to continue
yea but when you start and your wr is like 15%
public school leech
i think you hit more nigger requirements than i do
but that's still bullshit and unfun
ok sure
its literally like saying &quot;well the more you play the less gold on average your enemy starts with&quot;
if you have fair matches until then its actually satisfying
yea but why bother to get to that point
which random matchmaking is
i mean i don't like losing off shit that i cant control
how much fun would that really be
if you qued for a 1v1 and the enemy had randomly between 1 and 10000 gold
nobody wants a match that's weighted in one way right off the start
yea that would still suck
it would suck cause all youre trying to do is play a fair game
like if you que for league and randomly get a team of all bronze or all challenger
or unfairly hard
cause you either get an unfairly easy match
its not appealing to know they don't matchmake on skill
its niche as fuck
within 2 months
90% of the people who played at the start dropped it
also look at the numbers
nobody
so if you start who do you match against
because so few people play
is that when you get into it theres literally nobody else at that skill
also mars the problem with games that have small player bases
his zoe mastery isn't 0
milos opinion is degenerate
milos a zoe main
one person isn't convincing
the best way to sell something is to have an actual fanbase for it
worthless like the gameplay
and the price
the visuals in that game are pretty good
something good
otherwise slots on your phone would be the worlds most popular game
anything that has that many players has to have something good
but its not bad either
dota is definitely not good
I mean I don't think league is a bad game
at least its average player base is above 1000
eh I think even dota 2 is better than absolver
hes salty he cant get his fix
and like any other addict
stfu
also milo is an lp addict. if you message him he just tells you to stf
wait...
yea cause playing against the same people doesn't get old
absolver gay
addict
lp
is there anyone that does wanna play league tho
new tier is gonna have all the bronze 1 to s3 ish players so that's you
scraping the barrel silver
bitch youre already wood tier
that would tilt the shit out of you
not if youre brand new and wood tier
too offensive to players in it
one is either sapphire/ruby and the other is confirmed not wood
theyre adding new tiers between bronze and silver, and plat and diamond
sapphire tier inc
why is my mmr 0
my wr is 57
18lp for a win at d5
also riot wtf
smite zoe mid is nightmare fuel
zoe &gt; zed
team is better
team
its not super important but I thought it was fun last time
so we could just do Friday or use subs
I mean I want to play but were doing campaign sunday and maybe milo will have a party sat
lul
so if youre lookin to get flex boosted
also I need to win 4 flex games for a ticket
diego who are we getting on our clash team
i was subtly toxic to them
I think that I'm gonna get banned
I'm fucking sick of the crab meta
hell yea I did
finally got the chance
wtf is this
watch this
cause its actually just the best meat
and its the most tilting thing
milo said he doesn't like them
at least youre normal
mars do you like scallops
banned
fuck him
well
dude i ban trundle every game now
like trundle
i don't play gay champs
like a smurf
hes blue and gay
idk what the fuck trundle is
is he?
wtf are you on
trundle is a top tier jg
no it was legit used to counter trundle
shes a good trundle counter
they picked her in msi
kindred was lcs qualith
how many gays have you known
just ask stuff like
like a vote on gay marriage
also the question thing
which my campus definitely is not large percentage of
idk. their signs were in spanish
such a bad system
and consider that their vote counts the same as mine
lol i had to listen to janitors protesting at my dorms
but when people are trying to sleep it sucks
being loud during the day is whatever
and cant exceed a set noise between 9pm and 9am
including foot traffic
cant block traffic in any way
nah protests should be limited to half a sidewalk
your company looks bad
so if you hire a low score dude
also they monitor who you spend time with like at work
cause nobody wants to deal with you
or be homeless
but yea if your score is really bad you basically just die
its stuff like i go on reddit and make a post about how shitty X politician is and how the whole government should be reworked
not flaming your friends
and trying to get people riled up
criticizing the government
talking shit online as in
its a good way to keep the retards in check
but without the dumb stuff
and talking shit online is pretty negative
you lose points
like if you don't visit your parents twice a year
some stuff is kind of stupid
protesting isnt
talking about opinions is fine
nah he probably wouldnt
too low score and banks, jobs, etc wont take you
do certain things and you lose score
its like demerits
approved actionism only
don't protest or encourage protests
visit your parents
pay taxes, don't get fined, etc
you get citizenship points for being a good citizen
no more blm
no points no vote
protest and you lose points
plus you could fix the blm shit with chinas citizenship score thing lol
is fucking retarded
because equal counting votes
well buddy you should study your own issues then
like broken into 4 tiers between no knowledge and a intro college course of knowledge
based on how many you get right your vote counts more or less
like maybe 10 basic questions
how it works, objective facts
like if youre voting on a nuclear power issue they should ask basic question on nuclear power
then weight the vote
so you can assess how educated they actually are about the topic
ballots should come with some kind of knowledge survey before the vote
yea but they don't use the internet either
like farmers whove never met a gay person voting on gay rights
while being totally uninformed as to how they actually are
mars the problem is that you get less opinions and worldviews, then you vote on policies that affect other people
and know how to keep them in line
that's the one thing i actually like about china and asia in general is that they understand not all people are equal
and only talks to his immediate neighbors 5 miles away
hasn't seen a city in two decades
my vote shouldn't count the same as some redneck farmer that watches fox news all day
over the votes of those without
a better system would weight the votes of those with degrees and jobs and wealth
yea but they probably didn't anticipate that people without high school diplomas voting
not their decision
you want the opinion of the masses
so its not bad that those in power choose who joins them
i think the opinions of the educated and informed are the ones you should listen to
tbh though do you want the poor masses to be voting
cat least officially they are
most are
even a broken clock is right twice a day
and you wonder why theyre going to space and we arent
while in china its 50% engineers and scientists turned politicians
American politics sucks. something like 90+% of politicians are lawyers turned politicians
some of them legit ride horses for transport
since theyre all poor as shit and uneducated
tbf tho its kind of accurate
and blame their problems on them
that's what they call liberals
from like right wingers
unfortunately i have
and country bums
yea but then again were the &quot;coastal elite&quot; according to rednecks
that shit is only nice when youre a tourist
or the northern European socialism
theres people who think we should imitate the French work culture of perpetual striking from the public transport
European culture overall is a fuckin meme
lol well
truly top notch
such fine cuisine
wow
idk what good british food is
at least French have some good things tho
actually so do french
british people eat all sorts of weird shit
well you know what
yes
Ireland yea
that's fair
and britain
puffin
i feel like theres a fair amount of meat that's nationality specific
do they have conch in Nigeria
sea cucumber
sea urchin
pretty sure that's just japan too
i was at a sushi place that served conch
boom
japan
octopus
its like night out food
its good but it isn't like fine dining or anything you know
brisket isn't korean
which just slows you down
even if you eat side dishes its a ton of meat
kbbq is a chore cause its heavy as fuck
miss me with that shit
I'm not lily, i don't eat my fries dipped in a frosty
i like my dishes even temp
and cold mango
yea but then its a bite of warm chicken
idk
:puke:
warm mango chunks tho
stfu
works
mango as a sauce
hey man
it sounds aight served cold
chicken and mango like as a salad?
rack of lamb
with that shit
gtfo
we were trying to talk about food
diego wtf
and i don't particularly like it with mint
theres only one good cut of lamb
i feel that
or similar enough
elk is venison yea
bruh
lamb and mint
weird meat
like it only beats shit like snake, crocodile, etc
its at the bottom
as far as standard and not exotic meats go
yea cause it just isnt
that's true for most things...
never amazing
usually i just think its aight
well i don't eat chicken very often so
like as far as chicken goes
its good
pretty good
without rice
it was basically a burrito bowl
yea
i just don't think chicken is that good
and it wasn't bad
my only experience with bbq chicken is on a salad
where its good alone
its the exact opposite of the 3 i just listed
chicken is a meat that just sucks without added flavor
dude chicken needs the bbq sauce
scallop, eel, lobster
assuming optimal freshness
seafood is the best kind of meat dude
you aren't eating sea vegetables
ofc seafood is meat wtf
well you said you don't like meat with sugary flavoring
and lamb
or at least seafood
mango is good with most meat
well again i think its meat dependent
idk. it depends on the meat
not like ice cream and your entrÃ©e just one the plate
well i guess it also has to be in a way you can get all the flavors in one bite
is boring
like a curry that's strictly spicy
i said food is better when you have flavor variety on the plate
I didn't say you have to cover the meat in other stuff
that if you do mono flavors its boring
anyway the point was though
its a sauce imo
then the bit that remains goes over the steak
you baste it in truffle butter
because that's my favorite thing on steak
but I count butter as a sauce
true
without any kind of vegetables or other flavors
you don't want just heavy steak and sauce
think about a plate with steak on it
the more you can balance the better it is
like sweet savory acidic spicy
the more flavors the better
what
dude
since usually its just pork and chicken
its like Asian food but with higher quality meat
Shrimp &amp; Scallop Har Gow Bamboo Shoots, Chinese Black Beans, Red Chili, Cilantro, XO Sauce
nah they have a few things that sound pretty good
I mean I like the stuff their basing it on
hells kitchen is just classic stuff
that actually sounds interesting enough to try
but wp24 has weird modern Asian cuisine
I want to go to hells kitchen too
aight fine
my heart cause nobody wanted to go to wp24
speaking of breaking things
yikes
idk theyre probably in the attic somewhere
idk we got them free
that's how much they were on preorder or smth
is too much for those things
also 1500
has potential but poorly executed
2/5
looks bad
have to speak to get it to update
tiny screen
just so bad
awful products
no you dont
ugh
speaking of I had 4 of those things
vs google glass and shit
like actual google
but a few things are amazing
most of their shit sucks
google is like france
or galaxy
no I said get an old iPhone 6
so its a mixed bag
but I think most French food falls into the meh or bad category while a few things go to the great
truffle butter steak
I mean some French stuff is good
just keep the pastries and normal meats
itd be pretty fine
I mean if they just cut the weird shit
but almost every steakhouse does it for some reason
its just not good
I'm talking about as a food and especially as an accoutrement to steak
I mean I'm not talking about the method of procuration
and that its literally liver
or have good texture
the fact that it just doesn't taste good
that's not one
of all the things to pair with steak
no fuck you its actually gross
white people with their shitty ass pallates?
who actually likes it
why does every steakhouse do foie gras
you can manage with 64 gigs easily
just move them onto your pc every few months
with pictures
again
nah that's too gay
and go with me to get dank steaks
so imagine you just don't waste money on the phone
cant lose your pc as easily as your phone
100%
should be on your computer
pics and videos
its cheaper and less likely to be lost
just store stuff on pc
64 is enough
the aesthetic is cohesive
nah youre wrong
go with me to get good food
save money
better phone
just get a used iPhone 6
and I want to go
and its not even near 600
for 600 theres also a place in Pasadena with kobe steaks
no so I can get a beef wellington
and we go to hells kitchen
how about you save the 600
ik
your phone is literally just for portable internet access
it is for a phone
its cheaper than on the phone
for about 100 bucks
yea but you can get a terabyte of storage for pc
none of that adds up to more than 30 gigs
books
your pictures
a couple apps
wat are you actually downloading onto your phone
why not just stream the music tho
keep that on your computer
yea no that's actually retarded af
not your porn collection
phones are for the internet and music
unless youre downloading movies 128 is overkill
and its barely 64
I have a ton of videos and pictures
from a Chinese company
you aren't getting quality
its not about specs its about the quality of the parts
don't settle for their shit phones
never settle is right
hmm
gives cheap products
Chinese company
except you get to walk a long ass windy bridge
nothing in san fran is better than la
not better than la
actually the food is aight
but not for a phone like wtf
the food is good
its not bad
like go to san fran
the 6 is still better
I have 2
iPhone x sucks
get with it you tard
parsa the title is god memes only
from san Francisco
do you want to pick up a Chinese phone
why the fuck
gtfo
old ass meme
we saw that
and your ass has more games than I do
I haven't seen your ass above silver 4
mars you wanna talk about hardstuck
so I don't decay
I play once a month
nah
yee
still won tho
he died to kat solo
I think it was him
fuck
ugh
hes awful
I'm tilted off my ass
if this is actually him
fuck
and I cant dodge cause I'm 2-2 in series
with that
cause theres a tf in my lobby
is gross gores league name just gross gore
and shooting niggers
is the video just him dancing crazy
thanks
no one tricks riot
series time
no
more like
absolver
or I kick you again
stop posting pictures of people
and still feel tired
wake up
you guys ever sleep 12-12
yannef
then its pretty viable
except if you play ekko/asol
smite mid is shit
all they do is split and that's just fighting minions
cause top laners don't need gold
lol
never let that cancer through on crab meta patch
ban ww people
also
or even the actual sit in lane doing nothing &quot;gank&quot; that just evens out a losing lane
or walk into lane and shove for your top so they can get your crab
I think fucking pranking might be a viable strat now. just sit in the river bush by where next scuttle is and just zone
unless you want to be level 4 when mid is 6
everyones going to
and since they have to tax now
you cant cuck the jungler well
the thing is that unless youre willing to take smite in lane
either lanes get camped or taxed
and you actually get a pretty big level lead since they don't reduce your xp anymore
once youre equal to lanes then back to farming the jungle
new jungle is contest crabs and tax lanes
gtfo
really
did you say laurel
but in the center its yanny
obv
yanny
tiltproof btw
honor 4 btw
I wish tribunal was still a thing so someone would see my flame
&quot;ez why did you build a qss?&quot;
&quot;to cleanse myself of the experience of playing with you idiots&quot;
ree
wheres team
anyway
that's the best one
yea there you go
ism
bored
apart or a part
is team available
a reference all of 2 people understand
yikes
not too bad
its 33% more gold with one assist
I turn voices off for them
yea but playing those two sucks
its too edgy to be fun to listen to all game
have you heard his voice
drowned man who wants to brutally stab people
no hes definitely edgy
its worse than Camille clear and she only works cause her ganks at 2 are good
w and e are mobility
nah he sucks jg. that clear looks like shit
if he were actually interesting themed I totally would based on the kit
his theme and general edginess is too much to be worth it
same. but I don't support so I cant
his roams and map control have the potential to be nutty
which is the single best vision item in the game
well I think hes good cause now supps can use duskblade
fucking stop
can I gather a team
black now
the cuffs went on and bam
and became black

terraria
stardew multiplayer?
or still parsa
so did diego have the lowest score
has been really good
and ive been to a lot
but every restaurant at the top of a nice hotel ive ever been to
maybe
I'm just taking the safe assumption its better
and modern cuisine
has a famous chef
and you know
no but its on top of the ritz
even samo does it
what theater still doesn't do assigned seating
and its not as fancy or famous
cause ive been to daikokuya
fuck
which like
but everyone at usc got tickets home for the day after finals
well again I was gonna go with connor
I don't want to have to see if my family wants to go
cmon
yea
connor wanted to go but he went home already
reeeee
that also sounds lit af
that or we should go to hells kitchen
idk. I think the price is totally reasonable. especially for how nice the place is and the guy running it
but for an actual restaurant its about 25
yea sure if you go to a tiny restaurant tucked into one of those pico mini plazas
which isn't bad
so its only 5-20 more
well a normal entrÃ©e is like 25
yea its pretty cheap
hes got a few places around la
yea that guy
the guy who runs it has a bunch of Michelin stars and its pretty cheap
its on top of the ritz carlton
also does anyone want to go to WP24
wtf
yo
missions
league
just fucking sociopaths
theyre not even autists tbh
both of you are deep on the spectrum
how the fuck would you two know
should kind of just be natural
but having enough empathy to not be autistic
I mean I agree
shock therapy is always an option
its ok
mars
but nobody else
i expected parsa to get under 30
I mean
how are you fucks so autistic
about expected tbh
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

vegas
none of these dumb ass no skillshot point and click champs

I always wanted horror movie league

i have single player amounts of free time bby
jk fuck league

so I don't use it at school
It just mats my hair down
dude ive always had this thing
hype
its just stardew and skyrim marathons now
when its fucking mars's
and I got an actual headset so you bitches cant say its my windtunnel anymore

yikes
you know, like if the kkk ever goes down
eh you might
that was terrible
1000th is too soon
actually lets say 10000th
and goes to prison
and just beats his ass
finds the 1000th guy who steals baron from him
just gets mad and assaults someone someday
it could be anyone
anger management issues
i gotta say its Michael 2.0
of the 11 in this chat
Michael i don't think youre most likely to end up in prison
you know what tho
but i don't think anyone would end up in white collar prison
yea. its a toss up between white collar prison and solitary
in which case youd probably be put in solitary for it
and if one of you did some serious shit itd be because of a mental break causing you to perform some fucked up act
so youd only end up in there for some serious shit
or get a lawyer to tone down any non serious charges
well nobody is poor enough to lack the mental capacity to avoid prison
i figure if one of us ends up in prison theyd be in solitary anyway
idk
because any option is better than dining hall food
im just telling david its an option
cmonbruh
I'm not threatening to do it
clear a path <ss type="wink">;)</ss>
time to rent a car
yikes
ever heard of it
quality &gt; quantity
yea but you can get food delivered
not full meals
the only reason to go to the dining hall is for free drinks
or postmates
do you not have restaurants on campus
i have a final in an hour and id love to miss it cause of mexicans
I wish theyd cancel class for strikes
it was disgusting
strikes are aids. I had to walk like 20 feet around a bunch of Mexican janitors
the fact that your social issues actually matter for once?
not by pissing them off with noise and attention whoring
that's how you get people to join your cause
japan did them right. their buses went on strike a few days ago but kept running, just not collecting fares so the company got hurt but the public didnt
strikes are dumb
and had maybe two English signs
well they got kicked out in like an hour
wrote their signs in Spanish so even if we gave a fuck we couldn't understand their problem
fucking mexicans
I remember now
our custodial staff went on strike for a day too
oh shit
who gives a fuck anymore
its been over a year since trump
also protests in 2018 lol what

spot mars
were we supposed to say yes to most of these
spermintide lul
ez
therefore he cant win
well we haven't lost to one
mundo sucks
and so the conclusion is
you don't need to heal when your health growth is exponential
so its ideally infinite
he didn't specify a cost for horsepower increase
or risk straight dying before your healing pops off
so either you have to pop early and lose value
when he ult
even if he heals like a motherfucker, when they increase his ult cost hes vulnerable to just fucking dying
yea
especially since his kit is countered by an 800g buy
so it does matter how he does in lane
you can say that about nasus but he still loses games
here i go into chemo again
oh boy

stark has to die

I think most of them die in the comics actually
cap dies
stark dies
Go suck riots dick so they rig the system for you
No you fucking one trick 
god bless
I'm not the only one
riot cmon
and riven is pretty weak
and magic
also lore yasuo is a lot more op
i get the feeling yasuo is not gonna be titled the unforgiven for much longer
actual character development and lore updates that potentially changes their in game titles...
but they only do that when a lore event is coming soon
its pretty good
they released a three part short story about riven and yasuo
also, does anyone else see a lore event incoming
and not the peak as your real rank
as long as you take the average
again, i think that the individual ranks idea works super well
and its something that they have the tech to detect anyway
the only thing you can do is retroactively ban them for not playing their assigned role
but you cant swap where they physically go in game
its cheating
its like signing up for butterfly in a swim meet then swimming freestyle
so i free win
then i swap back to mid and I'm diamond there
so if i get assigned top which I'm gold in, ill have gold enemies
but they cant change the enemy players
no they can detect what role you actually play in game
whats the other option
that and the average rank change
which is basically smurfing
then just swap and get your main role
play in a lower elo
cause otherwise you get an offrole
in ranked
that should be a ban
also i think that since they have the tech to notice players swapped roles
yea but i want my reward for my rank to last me my whole season
ok then rito
guess i don't have a border 11/12 months of the year
like well shit
also your ranked border being your current rank sucks
then took a hard 180 at the end
and how they almost fixed it
than how shitty ranked is
i think that's a much smaller issue
but I guess yea
get good at jg?
what does that have to do with it
except for how theyre choosing to determine your final rank afterwards
the separate ranks works well
theyre 90% of the way to the right change to make
but its definitely not diamond
like 4 in gold 1 in diamond is plat
you can even weight it towards their highest
and take average rank between roles
just keep their idea rn
fuck that
whats the point of playing anything but jg if riot gives me rewards only based on how well I do in the jg
as people who take the time to learn different roles
so don't give them the same rewards
you deserve that rank
but what theyre doing is saying that if you have one role at x rank
thatd be fine too
if you had individual rank elos and the average was your reward
is the one you get rewards for
theyre encouraging being good at one role because your best role elo
riots taking ranked in the opposite direction it should go
cause nobody is brand new at their role
so its actually a fair match
and eventually, the players will know all roles
so they'll have to learn how to not be affected by mandatory fill
wont climb any more
the people most affected by autofilling
and it changes
if you have to play a specific position each game
theres no autofill
think about it
if your team is autofilled
its not competitive when every game is decided by a dice roll
its about keeping ranked competitive
this has nothing to do with that
in a fair environment
where people want to win
but why bring that cancer into ranked
so you can play for fun
sure
what a fucking nightmare they need to play the game
god forbid they have to play and learn other champs in other positions
cant hit diamond by one tricking panth top if you get top 1/5 games
cause those bitches wont climb to it any more
this affects diamond most
I don't care about them
and they just fucking int
its literally every other game you get one on your team
a lot fewer janna/panth/soraka one tricks hit diamond
the old system worked fine
and play hots like the bitch you are
or leave the game
like if you want to one trick shit stick to normals
and if you get 2 mid one tricks its an instant loss
because my shitty teammates wont do well in every role
your argument that the team has to accommodate one tricks is why they should be eliminated
I can play every role confidently
no
its my fault
its not the other guys fault
then I int
if I give up my lane
its the one tricks job to be able to play what hes needed to
no they arent
it gets rid of the chimpanzees
so if everyone has to now know all roles
and hard int when they dont
where people only know one role/champ half the time
ranked is a fiesta already
fuck them don't play ranked?
but if you have to its fine cause its not your choice
cause if you play an off role normally you just feel like youre throwing intentionally
like youre trolling by picking your off role
idk. I think itd be fun playing more champs without feeling guilty
which is really good
I think it discourages one tricking super hard
etc
then supp
play a game mid, your next is adc
id honestly be fine with making players cycle too
unless you win them all you still wont climb
and you get your role 60% of the time
yea but if you truly are a one trick
and I definitely didn't get both my role and champ in 80% of games
I had to on occasion in the old one
yea but ive never had to play top in the new system
not diamond
so if youre silver-silver-diamond-silver-silver you should be gold
your rank should be the average of your skill across all positions
and get a rank you don't really deserve
I mean I think its a dumb way to cheese the system
except one
and champ
when they suck at every role
still. I think its dumb that players like parsa can get to gold
fine enjoy one tricking
if you main supp
ok sure
but its not the 80% it is rn
sure
it just encourages one tricking
so why let people climb to a certain role on their fav champs
like you aren't a gold player if you are gold in one role, you have to be gold in all roles
fuck you if you cant play every role at a competent level
and just keep the other changes
honestly I think you shouldn't be able to que positions any more
you need a shit ton of time to climb in even 2 roles
and gold everything else
so ill probably look like just a diamond jg
nah it sucks cause I'm actually good at multiple roles but I don't have the time to climb in all of them
that was out of nowhere
I didn't see the individual ranks for roles tho
who saw the fuckton of ranked changes for next season
can we talk about playing league tho
I like bottles
cans you have to finish it all at once
anyone wanna play league
nigga wut
who would want to be part of something danech is in

diego were gonna have to have a talk
I don't appreciate that

most awkward lunch ever
my parents called me saying they were putting helios down right as I was going to lunch with a bunch of children I was tutoring
who tf are you stalking irl
when statistically it should be mostly mid
this survey sucks its somehow mostly supp
it was against every other movie
Mulan won finals
just like reality
dark skinned savages
be careful
parsa if you talk shit about Mulan rn
I don't see it though
Mulan 2 wasn't even bad
I like it
and still hits the nightmarish/haunted look
its so different from normal edgy
but the art style and intro for nbc gets me
Mulan is the most lit by so much
I still think the 2 best are nbc and mulan
and Ursula is too thick
kiss the girl is rapey af
is better than under the sea
I can paint with all the colors of the wind
most of the other stuff is good
how the fuck did chicken fucking little win
wait it is
why isn't moana on that list
youre objectively wrong
no
mermaid isn't better than pocahontas
who voted those
goofy and wreck it suck dick
idk how that made finals
honestly I didn't like lilo and stitch
and jack skellington is one of the best Disney main characters ever
the first song is epic as fuck
but nightmare before Christmas was epic as fuck
I mean it was good
or however you spell that shit
ratatoui
atlantis
bolt
monsters u
you cant possibly troll so hard as to say brave
this is Halloween fuckboi
and stay out
I'm fine with that
theyre retarded for eliminating nightmare before Christmas so early
at least Mulan won
therefore the build up cannot be far off
is correct
the end result
this chart is correct
Mulan winning
toy story &gt; monsters any
league
tbh
unfortunate
without listening into their conversations
how do you even tell the difference
at least
its always been like 60% white
always wtf

I think someone mentioned vermintide
idk
anyone wanna get rat aids
vermintide?
hes the only one edgy enough
the main character has got to be parsa
aviator is great
doesn't actually feel that strong tbh
same
I wanna play her
shit get me in there
she sounds older now
Boots are always mercs or tabi
Unless you need sustain
Either way phage and tiamat is the way to start
Tri is good against no tanks
I like cleaver and ravenous
Idk. Klepto or glacial
Is this some nightmare where I'm hallucinating samo again
And Cindy yen 
I just saw her
Wait Milo does Jackie yacko whatever go to usc
Not if you want to win
Fiora/diana easy elo
Play heavy splitters
Mars in silver you don't need them to win cause you que mid/top and just shit on the enemy
Fair. Aviator is the best one 
thats really rare
and before you say they can still lose after you help
you have a solid minute to make a play mid/top and set them to win
well considering his first clear sucks and youll likely force him to back during it
so you know he has to be looking top and its not like jax is hard to track
and he cant really gank bot
its on mid to get the deep wards by his blue/wraiths
denying him
cause otherwise your jg would be in his
if hes ganking your team has shit vision
so he has no way out
no jax takes q until 3 anyway
like ive outdueled him on shyv level 2 even when he hit 3 during the fight
and during that third one you jump him
either way you know his path is bottom buff-&gt;camp-&gt; either red/camp 2
or play an equally fast clearer
his fast clear doesnt mean shit when you do one less camp
but fast clear doesnt mean he cant be invaded
ik you arent a jungler
he loses more health than most jgs while doing less damage in a duel
as long as you have lane pressure
every time he either loses flash or dies doing red
with different jgs
dude i literally played that matchup at least 6 times
his third camp is a free kill
he gets low af clearing the first time
in what world lol
or voli
or sej or skarner
nah you cant invade lee or kha
i mean i only hit diamond playing shyv vs jax
Edited previous message: like your top and mid dont let the enemy lanes roam<e_m ts="1521572937" ts_ms="1521572937363" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
and he just dies to them
like your top and mid dont let the enemy jg roam
he can be invaded easily and cant gank well
his jungling sucks if the enemy team wards well
if you cant beat him with cc just beat him with damage
yea basically
or any early game bruiser
or darius
play fiora
yea you can
just wave management 1v1s
no skillshots to dodge
all champions should be malphite v malphite
hes a cancer champ
if you have to outplay azir
milo be careful
if she gets an e or r off she just goes through it
also azir ult only stops one dash
i dont think shes a mid laner
what a cancer champ
you have to outplay her
hey but mars
compared to the old one
she looks graceful
like theyre just opening themselves up at that point
without needing to move
shoulder spikes getting grabbed is probably fine when you can blade bend
they might absorb enough force to make it glance off the neck armor
her neck is armored
like a horizontal neck swing gets deflected?
not sure
im pretty sure those are for deflecting a sword or smth coming at your neck
but its a better style
like idc for the composition or anything
now its actually in a good style
nightblade was weeb af
nah aviator and nightblade got buffed big
when silvers should just play annie and malph lol
they think theyre able to play complex shit like that
silver players think yasuo is good
also that
Idk, outplaying should not be a requirement for the enemy to win a fight
you said that abilities shouldnt be balanced around hitting them
like skill shouldnt be determined by dodging or hitting skillshots
but if you say some bronze shit
im not
fair then
i cant imagine they change her in game color scheme
also the in game is probably the same
and diego and i are around diamond
when you literally play in silver
i mean im still triggered that both you and michael are gonna talk shit about how banworthy she is
the randos
mars
r a n d o m s
its distrubing
soloq randos
ive seen retard soloq irelias better than yours
i must have repressed the memories
idk. im using aviator from now on so fuck frostbutt
i dont remember you playing her at all
when did you play irelia
do you even own that skin
who looks at loading screen ulu
if youre gonna ban her
care
michael why do you even are
not really. current frostbutt art sucks
mars i was literally playing her yesterday
is shes the same as current frostbutt
so what youre saying
shes pretty much the same as the current
are you looking at the same art
but aviator has some good art
shes still thicc as shit
frostbutt looks fine
a big part of the game is picking your champion
and use their abilities
you get to pick any champ you want
players do win the game
or hug a wall
like fiora you can not cc into her parry
whereas good champions that are fun to play and play against have ways to outplay them
so you just have to hope they misplay
yea but compared to like fiora you dont have mechanics to outplay people
sit there and bitch when better players fuck you up
just like
cant
for not picking a champ you can display skill on
if they outplay you its your fault
and if theyre worse you win
if you dont want to outplay people pick malphite
wtf do you mean you shouldnt have to outplay to win
which is harder but does more
its like ez q is easy to hit but not rewarding compared to taric q
those work different
not a basic ability
thats an ult
thats how the game is balanced
yes it is lol. the harder it is to outplay the less rewarding it is
yea but thats not balanced around its hit chance
honestly im gonna smurf irelia when shes out
its not hard
just play around shit
like an annie q should hurt as much as a nid spear
so youre saying point and clicks should have the same power as targeted abilities
...
like you have shit like sion scarner sej to ban
i really doubt shes gonna be permad
and youre good
really you just have to be good and dodge the e
if you dont flash or dodge the initial skillshot
her ult stops your autos for a second
like her q is the same
not really because she doesnt have anything more cancer than before
and you can dodge her ult
she cant move during w
you have to be a major chimp to get hit by her stun
she doesnt look that good
and theâ€¦idk what else actually
who could forget the dragon change
you chimpanzee retards
he already got one
why is aviator better than frostbutt
you don't even que
fuck you
idk
bird thighs
same
all the ionian girls are tho
hes not thicc at all
nah i main ionian waifus
i main irelia now btw
its so inviting
yea get into this open party
hmm

Michael wtf
why doesn't it work
wait
//kick same/
cancer
legit
what does it take to get fucking banned rito
or scum
4k
and 4k dpi
is using MS paint
I feel like the only excuse for being an adult and drawing something of that quality
both of them make me reconsider my stance on premeditated murder
.
$3
so ill get it in 2 weeks
isn't it in beta
I'm still walking free
also riot doesn't ban shit
yo vermintide 2 looks dank
why are you just coming in and shilling
I gotta play new rengar
lets team
idk ive had fun
yo league is good rn tbh
TEAM
I'm gonna join and not pick a role
if I ever catch anyone in an open party
we gonna play on it
they count as half or smth
even riot sees it
always cool
never flame
you motherfuckers doubted me huh
I ban new stuff because fuck anyone who wants to have fun
you do know he threw demon parts at you
and dragon scales
i get to eat demon hearts
hes danker
idc really
like a level or two above power
im ok with where everyone is rn
yea definitely there
ez
20d6+80
even one round of double disintegrate is busted
yea i think that's too much
no itd be 2 per turn
and thatd be like 5-6 rounds of insane damage
until youre out of spell slots or sorcery points
then double fireball again
then double fireball
yea but if quicken spell let you do 2 spells of any level you could like double disintegrate
or ok
isn't normal
like doing 80 damage in a turn
theres such thing as too much burst tho
not like burn a solid chunk of your power instantly
but i think they did it cause they wanted quicken spell to just mean you get to run twice and cast
but for now i wanna see how it goes
i don't know if i like that much
ok good
if you bonus action cast a spell of level 1 or higher, you can only cast a cantrip with your action
you cant cast 2 spells of level 1 or higher
temp hp doesnt stack, you pick which one to keep when you get new temp hp
didn't i just post a quote from the guide that it doesnt
1d6 per turn -&gt; OH BOY IM A TANK
are you a tanky boi
miles
youre like a squishy fighter
letho is a motherfucking tank
you have like 48 hp
youre not a tank tho
as basically anyone else
pravaal has done like 20x the damage in pvp
you know what tho
ree
and i don't take advantage
just like you don't remind me when creatures have magic resist
if you die cause you forgot to do something you could its not on me
nah im supposed to keep track of the shit that's hitting you
im not gonna remind you
and make a macro for the damage or smth
you haven't remembered once
also make your fucking healing a macro
that's weirdly true
&gt;rolls a 1
but at least youre a kamikaze
so that's quite a way to go
well youre at 1
but hes not that much less intelligent that her
that's true
- cheqir 2k18
just like &quot;well hes already an abomination so you take it&quot;
like cheqir left him to dry when the emperor was offering the phoenix
the dank shit though is how hes kinda been forced by everyone else into these transformations
youd be scared as shit too
imagine if like one of those spooky ghosts from a horror movie tried to hit on you
tryna smash them
looking like an actual fey creature
and this bitch comes up to them
like commoners probably tell tales of fey stealing babies and shit
trying to steal their soul or something
honestly though girls probably think hes some kind of archfey
that's ever girls dream tbh
and he reforms with vines
his eyes glow an unearthly green
this niggas flesh is constantly on display
like you think lethos scary
then again hes one scary dude
its pretty in character
hes tried to smash the maids
increase your meme quality
bad memes aren't accepted here
who put you back in this chat
pick one
or 1 bonus point
so im gonna give inspiration for that
he brought them back like a true cleric
you know what tho
that's what you come up as
all it means is when spells that detect or target alignment
honestly i don't care about alignment
didn't gemi anti ks you
chaotic good btw
but you know what i mean
i guess you didn't kill them
omegalul
cause they had 4 hp
you fucking killed them
and then guess wahat
not commoners with 0
you got mugged by children with +2 and proficiency in sleight of hand
plus i already did that
is unnecessary
but putting unnecessary detail into npcs that will never come up
detail is good
ok what does a barmaid or barhand have a 14 in
its a fucking npc
commoner isn't a tag
commoner
a fucking
is no longer
any commoner with a 14 in a stat
and it makes no difference either way
they've got either a 0 or 1 in all
yea but their stats don't matter
you fucking degenerate
so why do you care about commoners stats
its not worth considering
that's like saying &quot;if by some miracle a level 1 crits the tarrasque to death&quot;
its all the same to you
being swarmed by infinite smiths or infinite maids
so why do their stats matter
and never die
because literally with your current stats you could fight an infinite number of commoners with +1 in con, str, dex, int, whatever
with their pitchforks
who stabbed you to death
dead to a bunch of commoners on board
are you trying to end up lost at sea
youre gonna dodge a sword swing from hay while trying to pick it up
you don't have to avoid and try to hit a stack of hay
doesnt try to hit you
hay doesn't dodge
no its not
just cause you move hay with a pitchfork doesn't mean you know how to wield it as a weapon
just cause you stab people with a spear a lot doesn't mean you know how to throw it
and not a forge tool
because theyre using it as a weapon
1/100
the chance of them hitting is .01
and your ac is 18
when they have disadvantage from lack of proficiency
wont matter
0 to hit or 1 to hit
matter
it doesnt
YOU CANT BE HIT BY EITHER
and you cant not kill them with your dex mod
they cant hit you without rolling a nat 17 or higher
and they have 10 ac
you cant miss because you have a +9 to hit
so basically never hit anything
and have no proficiencies as commoners
they'll die to anything
they have their con mod in hit points
theyre level 0
do their stats matter
its just how it was
men died more than women in those days
alchemical mistake
or forge mishap
or you could die in a field accident
at any time a nobleman can come by and pillage your town or a foreign throne will decide to raid your city
theres never a time where its safe to be a commoner
theres always bandits and noblemen squabbles
also theres no times of peace in medieval days
yea but men are the ones sent to deal with them
whos most likely to be sent to kill them
and this is a world with monsters
yea but war kills a lot of men
in times of war
like the ratio is 55-45 usually
men died a LOT during those days
commoners are probably mostly women tho
i agree that a farmer will have a str of like 12 normally if theyre male and not elderly or children
who likely are the ones with higher str
and not young men
well probably because the population is skewed towards women and children
whatever fucking number you pick to be average will have a 0 modifier, meaning you have an equal chance to fail or pass any task as any other normal person
than normal
14 means youre 10% more likely to succeed at any given task
10 isn't useless, you have the same chances as everyone else for every task
because theyre average people
straight 10s
that's exactly what they have
youre fit
and youre average
well if everyone is fit on average
but average is dumb af
just like 10 can be average
its just average
10 can be buff
that youre exactly average
because that's what having 10 in a stat is supposed to mean
they have stats that vary but the average is 10
and has a 50% to be below 10
everyone else rolls for stats
adventurers are chosen so they get to
because most humans don't stat buy
50% of humans are below 10
wtf are you talking about
because you cant go into decimals for creatures where it logically should be
using integers the lowest is inevitably gonna be a large range

&lt;&lt;&lt; </legacyquote></quote>
which is 68% of people on the graph
which is 0 modifier
the average human is exactly a 10
this is pretty good if you just take each +1 as 2 difference in ability score
not an int of 5
that's mentally retarded
they probably possess the possibility to be taught to read
not for lack of ability, for lack of education or motivation
you could PROBABLY teach the dumbest person to read
which makes sense
that's like the bottom .1% of humans
mild autism
that's just how they set it
yea, the ability to do that is a str of 10
and im not memeing this time
that's how bell curves and averages work
farmers (peasants) have a str of 10
14 is already top 2%
14% at 7 and 13
68% of all people would be between 8 and 12
how is that the general deviant range
because then theres likely a higher point males can get to
you cant realistically say a female can get to that peak
and so whatever you call that peak
theres gotta be some peak that's achievable naturally
and its not a bad idea
or the mortal peak
and the idea is that 20 should be the human peak
its not, but it has an idea for what certain scores mean
so at 19 youre as strong as a 12 foot giant
theres a belt of hill giant strength that sets you to 19
it takes unnatural means like magic to go beyond
20 is literally supposed to be the maximum achievable by mortals
and tons of training
a score of 18 is something you reach with steroids
A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many Monsters are a cut above average in most Abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and Monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.
is it really the peak then
and if females can reach the peak possible
20 is supposed to be the peak possible
aka not lizardfolk
idk. i think its weird for a female pc to have 20 str or 20 con if youre human/elf/dwarf
but its unappealing
it can happen
so its therefore a 2/10 to watch
it just doesn't make for good entertainment
itd be weird even in the context of a game
like would you watch a bunch of dudes sit around and act feminine. like talk about nails and shit
a bunch of chicks sit around and pretend to be masculine af
but that doesn't mean its entertaining to watch
yea ik
i mean in any physical characteristic women wont be at even like an 18 realistically
why would they be female
and for a barbarian whose supposed to be superhuman even among men
the strongest females in the world aren't even top 5% of males
unless youre trying to tell me theyre of a race without sexual dimorphism or a dimorphism towards females being stronger
and its just not possible for females of any mammalian humanoid race
ok but like barbarians and fighters in rpgs are supposed to be like the top of the top of human physicality
as casters or rangers
i always imagine females in rpgs
i still cant
itd be weird
idk. like imagine a barbarian with a female voice
like jarring
its just weird
like hearing a female voice tryna say how they jump into the fray and pull their weapons out
girls trying to be all heroic and shit in combat
nah i think it was some homebrew star trek like thing
oh good its over
and i don't think theyre doing levels
theyre in space or smth
idk. 5 rando girls
and i was like ayy critical role
i saw them streaming
its painful
ive been watching for 5 minutes
the girls campaign is pretty shit
but like in actuality
cant come in here and recycle memes
i said something like &quot;i wish i was a movie critic so i could give it a 3/5&quot;
like 2 days ago
i already made that joke
3/4
and now weve gone full circle
yea and then i just memed him for a while
when normally its not quite as high
you might say that its 5/10
the quality is too high
q u a l i t y
its quite the masterpiece
to complete the meme
note the specific choice of numbers
idk i could've sworn i quoted it from you
average is 3/10
yea but i didn't use the phrase
mars do it
you should rethink it
milo i don't like that life choice
too much sjw
which is sad because an average girl campaign (5/10) is a 3/10 if judged by male campaign standards
no, even for girls campaigns this is a 2/10
tbh
i like that choice
my life choices?
like 2/10
and its awful
geek and sundry rn is streaming an all girls dnd
actually you know whats real tilt tho
and i cant allow that
from going full retard
youre like 2 seconds
jett
not bad
like blacks just killing people that accidentally get too close
i can believe that though
that's actually pretty tilting yea
who built it
wait what
&quot;nah, fuck that&quot;
&quot;huh, maybe we should check it out&quot;
&quot;hey, was there always this big ass city in the jungle&quot;
like google maps
or just a satellite saw them build the hologram
or walk through accidentally
how did nobody detect the holograms
no but like
hit me
like nobody noticed their intermittent development between backwater and futuristic
what was their explanation for why nobody noticed wakanda actually being dank af
both hypocritical and retarded enough
nice terminology
that's actually nigger shit
killing blacks and claiming they matter
af
i thought they were all black
retarded
invincible armor -&gt; unarmed combat
that's like starting with a free deathcap and building ad
are actually cancer
heroes that have some dank equipment but don't optimize around it
but probably not
i might now
nah, I wasn't gonna see it if he just uses his claws the whole time
in the first avengers
like caps shield literally absorbs all the force from thor dunking him
I thought the whole point of vibranium was it absorbed all the force
2/10
fuckin unarmed barbarian
why bother with defensive tactics and evasiveness
if you were invincible why wouldn't you just pick up the biggest and most reckless ass weapon to hit people with
because idk why the fuck he was tryna claw people in the other movies
ok good
or anything that isn't claws
or gun
does tchalla ever pick up a sword
heres the real question
and wasn't it because of a panther god
how much do they have anyway
theyd probably just beat each other to death with it
they wouldn't become wakanda in 50 years
but like if rn I just threw a bunch of vibranium at some random ass africans
I mean that would make sense
usually its not &quot;were gonna explain, but its all gonna sound like bullshit&quot;
or don't try to explain at all
yea but at least they usually go for some kind of realistic explaining
or they found people to teach them and killed or kept them there to maintain there secret
either they stole and imported designs and had a ton of natural geniuses who could reverse engineer them and understand the concepts
without modern electronics or the industry to build a simple engine
wakanda was some tribal shit beforehand
yea but they have education to build on
1/10
and without any leaks
without any outside help
youre saying that they went with the plot that the mere existence of a specific mineral turned a population without modern education into one with future tech
that's dumb
...
and then every child was born a genius afterwards
did they just suddently dig up space metal
when theyre otherwise a shithole in africa
how did wakanda find or produce scientists that invented all those things
ok sure but vibranium existing doesn't mean that theres gonna be people who know how to use it for advanced scientific development
so its not the first time they fucked up
when theyre supposed to be incredibly futuristic
then again marvel made asgardians wield swords
because its otherwise unbelievable
you need at least some realism
you cant build a fantasy on the ground of frankly, nothing
afro-futurism is honestly an oxymoron
without relying too much on suspension of disbelief
how do you convey an advanced society of a people whose defining historical trait is primitive society
actually that's a good point tho
hmm
which is which
primitive tribal practices and advanced society. you need one for a good movie and one to resonate with the black target audience

&lt;&lt;&lt; </legacyquote></quote>
and it was frankly, disgusting
after watching it
I saw a post with a bunch of Africans dancing in a theater
better or worse
compared to other marvel movies
like &quot;average is 3/10&quot; stupid
get your shit together
but like
listen, all I'm hearing here is some nig math which is to be expected after watching a movie like black panther
all I'm reading is you calling 3/10 average
or kick
give the negro panther a 10/10
youre fuckin racist
anyway
what you first said was that the average of movies is 3/10
no, youre saying a 4/10 movie is above average
that would need to be in reference to a larger set
you cant take a full set and say &quot;the average is actually here, at 30%&quot;
I get what hes saying but its dumb
is this shit some kind of smc meme
but all movies ever still average a 5/10
no, youre saying a set of movies containing all that have come out &quot;recently&quot; averages a 3/10
which is a bad thing
is retarded
but what youre saying with adjusting the average to 3/10 instead of 5/10
racism isn't a bad thing
Edited previous message: you cant have an average thats at 30%<e_m ts="1519279897" ts_ms="1519279897087" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
you cant have an average that at 30%
what your saying makes no mathematical sense
a 5/10 should be a &quot;bearable&quot;
nothing average should ever be considered good
wtf do you mean that shouldn't be the case
id be down but I'm dead tired
and do I get a reward if I send you back
what fucking zoo did they steal you from
its just the quality of average changes
average will always be 5/10
that's not how averages work
its pretty shit
if its 4/10
listen, 5/10 is average
&quot;4/10&quot; &quot;good movie&quot;
and zoes shit
so does anyone wanna team now that rengars reverted
af
shes actually sticc
is she even thicc
dont do that
thats just not good for you
gtfo

id pay 30 for it
It looks like shit
and blow them up
your tank marks someone in the back and you dash q
but she can assassinate the backline easy af
cause q splits to minions
shes pretty bad in groups
like a botrk and static rush
I think shes gonna be really good with invis build
kogmaw doesnt
or else shes gonna be boring af
her ult better be a short cd
that's nothing
its just a speed boost
e isn't even mobility
but at least shes hot
legit just ult
she doesn't have much mobility tho
Monday-Wednesday is a really bad time to que for me

howd you ever come up with it
that's a real original name
gg
THE PIT
hes gay tho
dude
Because memes
But there's that live streamer Hampton Brandon that's a total piece of shit so fuck all Hamptons
Idk who that is
but its NOT something people cant achieve
it IS also an ideal
it IS an adjective you can apply to people
you just expect too much from the word good
youre good
as long as your net sum of goodness is greater than your net sum of evil
many people are good
then, by your logic, people cant be good which just isn't true
you complicate it too much
good is anyone who does their best with righteous intention
that's asking the impossible
you can strive to do better but you can never do better than your best at any moment
theres nothing more to being good
if you did your best and you had good intentions
doing your best is all that counts
so that's enough
you do know that you did your best
you dont
for what you did
no, the knowledge that you did what you could and that it was the best choice should be enough solace
you are a good person
because as long as you have a just reason for doing what you did
you cant be wrong to save the one either
you cannot be wrong
if youre forced to save five people or one and you choose to save the five
regardless of the outcome
therefore I'm good
my intent was to help them
no
am I then retroactively evil
but then someone gets mugged deposting it
like if I decide right now to give 1000 to everyone on my floor
that makes no sense
but you cant say someone who did things with the best intentions in mind but ended up making things worse was evil
sure, don't judge them on their word
if, with the knowledge they had, they made the choice they think is right, then you cant retroactively say &quot;well now that its the future we know that your choice had complications, so youre evil&quot;
that's not a thing. you judge a person based on their intentions rather than their actions because you have knowledge they did not
like I can take a checklist and see &quot;yup got all the tickmarks&quot;
and that theres some measure that makes a person good
you just think that good is something objective and quantifiable
then you are a good person
it literally doesn't matter what you do, so long as you do it with good intentions
when you have a decision to make and you choose the one you believe is righteous, you are good
and he goes on to start ww2
you can choose to raise him better but you might die the next day
you cannot know past the moment you have the choice
its good because youre preventing the holocaust. if you allow him to live, you risk the possibility of it
its quite the paradox of awful
but It manages to be worse as well
its got the quality of literal shit
nigger shit song
shitty ass
what the fuck is that
why not just the typical classical score tho

The main problem area for Ones and Nines has to do with the opposite ways that they deal with conflicts and rising stress. Ones tend to become more openly frustrated with themselves and others and with the feeling that things are not going as they should. They begin to exude a prickly anger, edginess, and dissatisfaction with everything and everyone. They become obsessed with finding who is at fault, and with legislating how things could be improved. By contrast, when conflicts and stress increase, Nines begin to shut down and withdrawn. They become less effective at correcting problems and less able to speak about their feelings or discomfort. The worse things become, the more Nines attempt to tune them out while maintaining that nothing is the matter. Thus, judgments about the Nine's judgment and competence and willingness to take responsibility taint the One's dealings with Nines, while resistance and denial of problems (with a barely suppressed undertow of anger) infect the Nine.
The combination can be very powerful: they accomplish things with a clear cut sense of purpose and personal mission. Both are decisive and direct, although Eights bring a passion and gusto that counterbalances the One's self-restraint and propriety. Ones can find Eights exciting, physical, and earthy-all the things that they restrain in themselves. Thus, there can be a strong attraction from both sides. Further, Eights recognize that Ones are as strong-willed and determined as they are: they cannot easily sway or bowl over Ones. Eights thus admire their conviction and are attracted to the challenge of getting closer to Ones. In many ways, these two types are opposites-the pirate and the schoolteacher-although both could learn a great deal from the other, if they are willing to listen to someone with such different values, reactions, and ways of doing things.
diegos quiz
what type are you
parsa
feelsbad
yea but what level of 5
but you gotta be there 50% or more
look, you can peak into a level
which is a difficult as fuck task
it means though that you think the best of people you meet
which is kind of difficult to maintain
but &quot;being&quot; a level implies that you're like that most of the time
yea but the jump between levels isn't as big
or confucious
and being mlk
that's the jump between being a good person
Level 1 (At Their Best): Become extraordinarily wise and discerning. By accepting what is, they become transcendentally realistic, knowing the best action to take in each moment. Humane, inspiring, and hopeful: the truth will be heard.
its basically &quot;be fuckin ghandi/Buddha&quot;
type 1 has the hardest level 1 to achieve tho
are pretty simple
honestly level 2 and 3 for 1
Level 2: Conscientious with strong personal convictions: they have an intense sense of right and wrong, personal religious and moral values. Wish to be rational, reasonable, self-disciplined, mature, moderate in all things.

Level 3: Extremely principled, always want to be fair, objective, and ethical: truth and justice primary values. Sense of responsibility, personal integrity, and of having a higher purpose often make them teachers and witnesses to the truth.
except level 1 which is probably the hardest of all
but higher levels for type 1 aren't as hard
im openly level 4-6 90% of the time
i admit my problems
not a great mediator
not a great mediator
you consistently let us flame each other
with jet

just like everyone else here
mars youre a level 4

shit
well
yea but i want to hear him admit it
will you accept that fact
if i tell you rn that youre a bitchmade man

mars are you ever
same
these are yours
Type Nineâ€”Levels of Development
Healthy Levels

Level 1 (At Their Best): Become self-possessed, feeling autonomous and fulfilled: have great equanimity and contentment because they are present to themselves. Paradoxically, at one with self, and thus able to form more profound relationships. Intensely alive, fully connected to self and others.

Level 2: Deeply receptive, accepting, unselfconscious, emotionally stable and serene. Trusting of self and others, at ease with self and life, innocent and simple. Patient, unpretentious, good-natured, genuinely nice people.

Level 3: Optimistic, reassuring, supportive: have a healing and calming influenceâ€”harmonizing groups, bringing people together: a good mediator, synthesizer, and communicator.

Average Levels

Level 4: Fear conflicts, so become self-effacing and accommodating, idealizing others and &quot;going along&quot; with their wishes, saying &quot;yes&quot; to things they do not really want to do. Fall into conventional roles and expectations. Use philosophies and stock sayings to deflect others.

Level 5: Active, but disengaged, unreflective, and inattentive. Do not want to be affected, so become unresponsive and complacent, walking away from problems, and &quot;sweeping them under the rug.&quot; Thinking becomes hazy and ruminative, mostly comforting fantasies, as they begin to &quot;tune out&quot; reality, becoming oblivious. Emotionally indolent, unwillingness to exert self or to focus on problems: indifference.

Level 6: Begin to minimize problems, to appease others and to have &quot;peace at any price.&quot; Stubborn, fatalistic, and resigned, as if nothing could be done to change anything. Into wishful thinking, and magical solutions. Others frustrated and angry by their procrastination and unresponsiveness.

Unhealthy Levels

Level 7: Can be highly repressed, undeveloped, and ineffectual. Feel incapable of facing problems: become obstinate, dissociating self from all conflicts. Neglectful and dangerous to others.

Level 8: Wanting to block out of awareness anything that could affect them, they dissociate so much that they eventually cannot function: numb, depersonalized.

Level 9: They finally become severely disoriented and catatonic, abandoning themselves, turning into shattered shells. Multiple personalities possible. Generally corresponds to the Schizoid and Dependent personality disorders.
you know those are the levels for type 8 right
&gt;plays a barbarian
Healthy Levels

Level 1 (At Their Best): Become self-restrained and magnanimous, merciful and forbearing, mastering self through their self-surrender to a higher authority. Courageous, willing to put self in serious jeopardy to achieve their vision and have a lasting influence. May achieve true heroism and historical greatness.

Level 2: Self-assertive, self-confident, and strong: have learned to stand up for what they need and want. A resourceful, &quot;can do&quot; attitude and passionate inner drive.

Level 3: Decisive, authoritative, and commanding: the natural leader others look up to. Take initiative, make things happen: champion people, provider, protective, and honorable, carrying others with their strength.

Average Levels

Level 4: Self-sufficiency, financial independence, and having enough resources are important concerns: become enterprising, pragmatic, &quot;rugged individualists,&quot; wheeler-dealers. Risk-taking, hardworking, denying own emotional needs.

Level 5: Begin to dominate their environment, including others: want to feel that others are behind them, supporting their efforts. Swaggering, boastful, forceful, and expansive: the &quot;boss&quot; whose word is law. Proud, egocentric, want to impose their will and vision on everything, not seeing others as equals or treating them with respect.

Level 6: Become highly combative and intimidating to get their way: confrontational, belligerent, creating adversarial relationships. Everything a test of wills, and they will not back down. Use threats and reprisals to get obedience from others, to keep others off balance and insecure. However, unjust treatment makes others fear and resent them, possibly also band together against them.

Unhealthy Levels

Level 7: Defying any attempt to control them, become completely ruthless, dictatorial, &quot;might makes right.&quot; The criminal and outlaw, renegade, and con-artist. Hard-hearted, immoral and potentially violent.

Level 8: Develop delusional ideas about their power, invincibility, and ability to prevail: megalomania, feeling omnipotent, invulnerable. Recklessly over-extending self.

Level 9: If they get in danger, they may brutally destroy everything that has not conformed to their will rather than surrender to anyone else. Vengeful, barbaric, murderous. Sociopathic tendencies. Generally corresponds to the Antisocial Personality Disorder.
5 is engineers

The main problem area for Ones and Nines has to do with the opposite ways that they deal with conflicts and rising stress. Ones tend to become more openly frustrated with themselves and others and with the feeling that things are not going as they should. They begin to exude a prickly anger, edginess, and dissatisfaction with everything and everyone. They become obsessed with finding who is at fault, and with legislating how things could be improved. By contrast, when conflicts and stress increase, Nines begin to shut down and withdrawn. They become less effective at correcting problems and less able to speak about their feelings or discomfort. The worse things become, the more Nines attempt to tune them out while maintaining that nothing is the matter. Thus, judgments about the Nine's judgment and competence and willingness to take responsibility taint the One's dealings with Nines, while resistance and denial of problems (with a barely suppressed undertow of anger) infect the Nine.

It is difficult for Nines to step up to the plate and take the level of responsibility that Ones are looking for. The more Ones push Nines to respond in the way they want, the less Nines are willing and able to do so, and they retreat into more widespread passive-aggressive behavior. To Ones, this feels like willful resistance and culpable negligence. The quiet indifference of the Nine only infuriates the One all the more. In short, it is difficult for Ones to respect Nines, just as it is difficult for Nines to feel comfortable with (and able to express themselves to) Ones. Ones eventually become more self-righteous and intolerant while Nines become more uncommunicative and stubbornly unresponsive. Others find it very difficult to be around this pair because of the obvious, painful zingers pointed at the Nine by the One-and because of the aura of barely suppressed rage coming from the Nine. This couple gets frozen in their anger, with no way to melt the impasse.
its ok we can still be friends
 Usually, the Nine's reluctance to get into conflicts is the easiest way to discern these adjacent types. Average Nines want to maintain peace in their lives, and while they may hold strong personal convictions, they generally do not want to argue about them with peopleâ€“especially people with whom they have an emotional attachment. For Ones, however, the principle is foremost, and Ones will drive home their point to convert the other to their view, even if it risks creating upsets and arguments. (&quot;The truth is the truth.&quot;)
theyre not that different i guess

Type Oneâ€”Levels of Development
Healthy Levels

Level 1 (At Their Best): Become extraordinarily wise and discerning. By accepting what is, they become transcendentally realistic, knowing the best action to take in each moment. Humane, inspiring, and hopeful: the truth will be heard.

Level 2: Conscientious with strong personal convictions: they have an intense sense of right and wrong, personal religious and moral values. Wish to be rational, reasonable, self-disciplined, mature, moderate in all things.

Level 3: Extremely principled, always want to be fair, objective, and ethical: truth and justice primary values. Sense of responsibility, personal integrity, and of having a higher purpose often make them teachers and witnesses to the truth.

Average Levels

Level 4: Dissatisfied with reality, they become high-minded idealists, feeling that it is up to them to improve everything: crusaders, advocates, critics. Into &quot;causes&quot; and explaining to others how things &quot;ought&quot; to be.

Level 5: Afraid of making a mistake: everything must be consistent with their ideals. Become orderly and well-organized, but impersonal, puritanical, emotionally constricted, rigidly keeping their feelings and impulses in check. Often workaholicsâ€”&quot;anal-compulsive,&quot; punctual, pedantic, and fastidious.

Level 6: Highly critical both of self and others: picky, judgmental, perfectionistic. Very opinionated about everything: correcting people and badgering them to &quot;do the right thing&quot;â€”as they see it. Impatient, never satisfied with anything unless it is done according to their prescriptions. Moralizing, scolding, abrasive, and indignantly angry.

Unhealthy Levels

Level 7: Can be highly dogmatic, self-righteous, intolerant, and inflexible. Begin dealing in absolutes: they alone know &quot;The Truth.&quot; Everyone else is wrong: very severe in judgments, while rationalizing own actions.

Level 8: Become obsessive about imperfection and the wrongdoing of others, although they may fall into contradictory actions, hypocritically doing the opposite of what they preach.

Level 9: Become condemnatory toward others, punitive and cruel to rid themselves of wrongdoers. Severe depressions, nervous breakdowns, and suicide attempts are likely. Generally corresponds to the Obsessive-Compulsive and Depressive personality disorders.

if you think that's bad you should see people on gaming subs when shit gets nerfed
keep to the side subs
gotta stay off the front page
no shit
s a m e
I watched it a few times and I kept feeling I knew one of the two
no wonder
legit just on the front page
and I thought it looked familiar but I don't remember why
like an hour ago
I saw it on reddit
still?
the autistic ramblings of neckbeards in their basements wiped out by the titan that is mickey mouse
its as if thousands of fanfics cried out and were silenced at once
it means its time to team
shit was lit
I just saw tlj again
TEAM
anyone wanna play league

that's a first
its the one people wear with the glasses
there is a school of the viper set

anyone up for league
psychic powers
cause yuri is better
i didn't ever pay attention to her
did she
after all, monika murders everyone else
plus i think they all love you
<ss type="wink">;)</ss>
yuri sucks you off
so that's neat
also shes psychic and can induce bloodlust
shes the only one who read books at the LITERATURE club
yuri was the best
shes the worst
sayori sucks
diego i need you to understand
or read this
you gotta watch the previous one too
im gonna warn everyone except sayori in the next game
its her poem
then to base 64 then to text
then convert the black and white in the center to binary
if you convert her .chr to a png
Can you hear me?

...Who are you?

I can't...I can't see you.

But I know you're there. Yeah...you can definitely hear me.

You've been watching for a while now, right?

I guess I should...introduce myself, or something. Um...my name is...actually, that's stupid. You obviously already know my name. Sorry.

Anyway...I'm guessing if you were able to put a stop to this, you would have done it by now.

I mean, I know you're not, like...evil, or anything...because you've already helped me so much.

I should really thank you for that. For everything you've done. You're really like a friend to me. So...thank you. So much.

I think...more than anything else...I really don't want it to all be for nothing.

...

Everyone else is dead.

Maybe you already know that. I'm sure you do, actually.

But...it doesn't have to be that way, right?

Well...there's a lot of stuff I don't understand. I don't know if it's even possible for me to understand it.

But I know that this isn't my only story.

I can see that now. Really clearly.

And I think everyone else has had the same kind of experience. Some kind of deja vu.

It's the Third Eye, right?

Anyway...I could be totally wrong about this. But I really think you might be able to do something.

I think you might be able to go back...or however you want to put it...

...To go back and tell them what's going to happen.

If they know ahead of time, then they should be able to avoid it.

They should...if they remember their time with me in the other worlds...they should remember what I tell them.

Yeah. I really think this might be possible. But it's up to you.

I'm sorry for always being...you know...

...

Never mind. I know that's wrong.

This is my story. It's time to be a fucking hero.

Both of us.



2018
monika the hero
its lit
diego did you see the libitina stuff
monika
its time to play more lux and pad my stats
theres only one conclusion
like its just you
jett isnt
Michael isnt
parsa isnt
mars isnt
diego isn't a support main
fucking jungle mains got more gold than you guys
youre all broke af
as far as mains go
which i didn't try as hard as when i was climbing in
yea but those were after hitting plat games
yea which is weird cause i trolled a lot of those
i had 7.4 cs on xayah
but like yea that's against silvers
moi is the only account i looked at with better gpm
lmao ez game
nah a lot of those games were actually him
jerrys?
who was i playing fiora on
wait it has only 10 fiora games
which is all me
its most played is fiora
wait ive played on that a lot more than you have
i die less than you
ye
wtf
hahahhaha
I WARD MORE ON MY SMURF
id assume
some smurf in bronze
n e v e r
with like 75% accuracy
who needs wards when you can mentally track the jg
of everyone i checked i have the highest gpm
those shits don't matter at all
theres no words for how little importance i put on warding
parsa averaging 2.5 cs
but who doesnt
apparently you ward more than me tho
mars I'm near 100 gpm on you
or no balls
balls
supports just run away
that makes sense
i feel like i had one game?
did i play twitch this season
wtf kind of stat is this
6.1k damage per death on twitch
i must play for late super often
7 months ago
my longest game of the year was 47 min
its literally been months
dude when was the last time we played a 40+ minute game
its not like i went late game that often
my average game time is pretty short tho
if i warded more id be too good
its like training weights
but better everything else
i have less damage mitigation and wards than average
nah fuck that
gut gpm
.2
literally the 2 worst farming roles
42% jungle
git gud
milo my gpm is a solid 40 over yours
i supported a lot this season
that's way better than i thought
my kha win rate is 66
that's cheap
oh
howd you know
you know whos my most played champ of the year tho
kappa
a solid 53% of my honors are for tilt proof
i really thought i had more
wtf
I only had 3 pentas
that was retarded

oh yea
that's intersting
we have exactly the same fastest baron
troll sup doesn't farm
fuckboi

the old story was literally just &quot;forbidden pit&quot; &quot;family dead&quot; &quot;goes into pit&quot;
find out what happens next at 11pm on fox
vs MAN SACRAFICES EVERYTHING TO SAVE HIS CITY
at least this is somewhat unique
the old lore was the most clichÃ©d piece of shit ever

LEAGUE
wtf kind of jewery is this
actually this whole game is really sarcastic
and my testicles retreating
about my sperm dying
when i went in the ice water
i got a bunch of really sarcastic dialogue
yea i died to a mooselion
but i have to actually play the game wtf
according to reddit
its supposed to be sakura avatar
I didn't sign up for this
why is there real gameplay
kms
hiking and group projects
yea
finally done with a day of disgusting social activity
any league or pub team?
its pretty cool looking
cmere
jett
davai
right at the gates
then instead of winning you just off each other
tfw you and your squad kill 20 at school
where is the team tho
not till 1
youre late
everyone
whos coming
we need 1 for league
TTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
teeeeeem
I'm ready
coach
me_irl
and you have midterms
when preseason hits
last year
hes too good to play with you fags
mars is silver lul
preseason is always fiesta
aka until season 8 starts
2 months
but more telegraphed
like an ahri charm
that e seems so easy to dodge
that's kinda weird
besides the wall bonus range
whats hard about it
its a line skillshot
its like with all the new mages
her skill ceiling is way higher than anyone thought
and then everyones gonna realize
I guarantee you were gonna get a video of faker on zoe
getting the most out of q is hard
is gonna be hard
optimally using the ult
I think if you try it shes gonna be hard to track
z o e
its not like yas or riven where you have tons of mobility and have to use it oprimally
its just wiggling
also hes not that hard
not dps mages
read
&quot;real mages&quot;
but no real mages
and adcs
cause we have melee carries with high skillcaps
high skillcap mages is something we need tho
so they aren't wrong
well you ARE a nazi
same
it was very philosophical
you should've heard our talk about what makes a good player
you know what i meant by lose
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
that's a fucking plot hole
then troy, with the favor of zeus, loses anyway
literally from Homer in the llliad
&quot;Hang me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it all of you, gods and goddesses together - tug as you will, you will not drag Zeus the supreme counselor from heaven to earth; but were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above all others either of gods or men.&quot;
no theyre Persian looking
or maybe they did too
except niggers i guess
literally everyone since the Egyptians knew you don't just leave dead bodies out
greeks burned/buried the dead to prevent it
its been around for millenia
they get sick
they don't know how but they know that when they throw decomposing flesh at the enemh
its one of the easiest tools in war
that's literally HOW you spread the plague on a whim
and spread the plague
you could throw animal carcasses and human bodies over their walls
the Trojan war was pretty rigged
so was zeus
and see if they declare war on you
give another country the plague
mars go become president of a country
is warlike in every days
i think giving people the plague
archery is pretty warlike too
i taught third graders earlier and they formed more coherent arguments about why 3d printing chocolate is necessary
mars I tried to think of a response but I couldn't
as far as ornn goes the freljord has the norse theme going
no she just batters people with heavy weaponry
everything to do with the sun
nothing to do with wisdom
I don't see any Athena there
similar
healing/defending
Apollo god of healing
hmm
almost feminine
also Athena is depicted with a spear
like Diana is chosen of the moon
leonas whole theme is chosen of the sun
Athena is wisdom and war
she literally throws sunlight around
ornns not part of targon
just an inspiration
its not like an exact copy
by that logic Apollo (Leona) should be male
taric is Hephaestus. hes the mountain aspect
whats going on here
and program is some kind of other faction
which hates zeds faction
apparently she hates ashes faction
is there even project lore
also project vayne is so fuckin edgy
i look forward to team
yea but wheres team
team btw
btw
gay tho
that was weird
I saw my ex on the walk back to my dorm
Kevin spacey?
?????????
in a show match
or like a void comp vs targon comp
I mean you could tie it into the game
ionia raped
that's how we got ionian boots of lucidity
they already did ionia vs noxus
void invasion or noxus vs demacia
Yea. That or we need events to update the lore
Or why targon keeps sending aspects when it's supposed to be once in a generation
We're never gonna know why Leona wants to find Diana in the new story or if nami ever gets that moon stone
Like the new stuff is way better written but it's all cliffhangers
I liked when the lore had games having an impact. Like buying a champ with ip was using your summoner influence to further their goal in return for being allowed to summon them
Adds nothing to the game or lore
Asol is a mistake
Where's Zeus rito 
And he died
Chronus has nothing to do with stars tho
moon, sun, mountain, war, messenger and whatever the fuck asol is
idk its pretty obvious theyre going for a greek pantheon theme with targon
what is asol tho
Diana = artemis
Leona = Apollo
taric = Hephaestus(?)
panteon = ares
zoe = hermes (?)
get the fuck out edgelord
and a higher ceiling unless you count obscure riven/yas mechanics like the beyblade flash
apparently shes got a higher skill floor than any other champ
but not a full assassin
shes basically just a hard counter to syndra/veig/point and click mages
and the q is never going to be longer than the ult if its her main damage ability
some rioter posted her ult cd
Her only long cd is e
Yea that's short too 
No it's 10 on ult and less on q
Every 10s or less based on cdr you have to dodge a nid spear
That q chunks hard if you get good range on it
She's gonna be a bitch to lane against
10/8/6s ult cd
Literally kassadin
minions drop summoner spells lol what
oh her ult cd is really short
Send me zoe r34?
well ok rip fakku Friday whats a zoe main ign
g a y
unless you can spam summoners
how do you kill anything without zoe q having a short cd
ALSO wtf zoe ult is kinda worthless
just let them hire you as a pedo
because giving a fuck is lame
though by that reasoning don't shave
yea you should shave if you care about the job
fuck you riot I knew it
I knew the Q did damage based on travel distance
Zoe is an ancient being, a cosmic messenger of Targon. When the Aspect of Twilight appears, she warps reality. Despite all this power, she often shirks her duties in favor of blowing bubbles and playing tricks on unsuspecting mortals. One can never be sure of what sheâ€™s really aiming for... other than her own amusement.
blood knight isn't even a class its just paladin with edgelord transmogs
shave
because dshield is too meta
hashinshin starts corrupting vs cassio
but it IS if he is
its not gay if HES not gay
thats why its gay to call him daddy
i know ls is gay
hashinshin is just bad
like i don't play against Caitlyn and start dblade or cull
against any matchup
i don't build literally the same every game for thousands of games
i type after i die
I don't afk in lane and die while typing
not like this
what he does is just inting
what I do is tilting
thats not tilting
that's gay
ALSO wtf is daddy LS
cause hes feeding every game I watch
apparently not
start inting
I don't even play jax and I wouldn't feed this hard
wtf
hes so baaaaaaaaaad
I'm fucking challenger now boys
hashinshin is d3
what the fuck is wrong with people
ill play ogrecock
oh
wheres the button for team
fuckin weeb
and I consider that bottom bit filled
cause 1 gets water first
define fill
no its just some autist who thought that was a good tattoo
&quot;I don't know, I can't speak China talk&quot;
goddamnit
I MISS THE OLD BOT
dude rip tatsumaki QQ
I died plenty to mobs as clothies after going oom
did you miss the part of levelling where we didn't all play edgelord rogues
so anyways wheres team
and heroic raids you all have to be on your game for each boss mechanic
then raids from normal are a bit hard and you need everyone relatively competant
heroics are a little hard but one geared player can just carry
normal dungeons are cakewalks
so then its just WoW
etc
or adds
or don't group for meteors
cant dps if you die to aoe
yea its always raid knowledge
most mmos have skill mixed with luck its just how much skill and how much luck
theres not much you can improve by just playing once your weekly/daily caps are done
mmo progression is probably 20% getting better at your class and 80% item luck tho
you don't rely on rng for items or anything
it doesn't reset with expansions
progress in league feels so much better than mmo progression imo
also new runes in 4 days
RIP tatsumaki
I miss the old bot, straight from the go bot
Chop up the girl bot, set on his porno bot
I hate the new bot, the bad hentai bot
The never lolis bot, spaz in the chat bot
I miss the sweet bot, never sent me traps bot
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet the bot
See, I invented the bot, it wasn't any bot
And now I look and look around and there's so many bots
I used to love the bot, I used to love the bot
I even had the level 3 bot, I thought I was the bot
What if the bot made a quality hentai
Called &quot;I Miss Tatsumaki tits&quot;? Man, that'd be so bot
That's all it was bot, we still love the old bot
And I love you like hentai
Gz on discount diamond nigga
Then she peed as soon as I took her back in
Waited 15 minutes
I took the dog out to go to the bathroom
Yea. It's nutmeg apparently
Blacker than mars
edgy champs need to stop
weeby ones are ok if its rare and a meme
Disney champs are the best champs
wheres the fun in that though
10/10
plus its a big fuck you to the edgelords who liked the last few champs
and just throws it right out
takes the seriousness that league has been going toward
nah zoe is the best fuck you
or spam more of those shitty grimdark Warhammer memes
say some edgy shit
jett you too I guess
parsa get in here so we can hear your edgy ass thoughts
like lulu or zoe
nah I like the campy ass champions
hes a meatgrinder
its pretty blatant
the kits are fine but the edginess isnt
fuck eve
fuck ww
fuck new urgot
yea fuck kayn
its so much better than the edgy shit recently
dude I love her theme
like a nid spear, increases damage on travel distance
her q might be the yoyo or whatever she slings twice
her ult is that portal thing
the bubble is a sleep
easy
so just don't flash when shes nearby
I'm assuming you can use the ones you pick up for a few seconds if yours are on cd
in those little bubbles on the floor
her passive is she picks up other peoples summoners
zoe main btw
dude I love it
teem?
kobolds LUL
new hearthstone xpac
my dick has a wiki entry
sieg heil?
if anyone wants to join in on this
so after I finish this essay connor and I are gonna do vodka shots and shoot up the school
I see weird empty lines
did that paste properly
ruined the unanimousness
i care
bitch
you know I think it was you that voted no
better not be some gay shit like getting educated
wheres team
which one of you fags voted no
cause Connors bein a puss about it
Asian girl on tinder
for sure
I'm sure it was
Who's responsible for this crime against humanity
so like you have a shit ton of time for your team to come get you up
and you don't drown for some reason
you can only be executed by melee
ALTHOUGH if you get knocked down in water town and your body is under water
you have a harder time placing higher cause people pick each other up
that's stupid
which is backwards af
also apparently getting second in duo gives like 500 bp and soloes gets 700 ish
he got shot dead first
in my defense
so now hes done for the night
and I got shot from the side I wasn't listening to lul
I wore one headphone and got second and connor tilted his ass off cause I wouldn't put in the other
dude win a fucking chicken dinner with me
bunch of fags
parsa and jett went on right as group started roasting
id rather have the stupid hexflash on pbe to set up ganks rather than eating the trees
did they remove it yet
tree eating is a shitty gimmick
nobody likes edgy grimdark games
its like an edgy grimdark game
they literally choose to make everything muted as fuck
they look the same because that game has a shitty color pallet that blends the foreground and background together too often
smh
I gave him a fat ree and threw my three grenades up the hill as a peace offering
what a dick
and he shot me
I reee'd at him over the mioc
my life is a meme
fuck dota
its 10x less gay
just do really well on the easy ass standard tests
you don't even need to study to go to school jett
so lets play league lul
yea ik but I have a midterm tomorrow
does anyone know linear algebra
teem
same
teem alive or teem dead
ranked flex?
I want cancer
wheres team
you degenerate thot
how dare you spread baseless claims
Michael fucking jour
l I v e
real men get shot at school
hots is shit
shouldn't you be oublelit
and wheres your f key
hey doublelift wheres your d key
where are you team
TEAM?
lets fuckin int on pbe
you guys wanna go hiking or to catalina or smth
whos gonna get some missions done with me
get this icon and ward
yea do the deathsworn missions
I got stuck with clowns doing it and I wasn't gonna go through that again
you didn't show up when we were actually doing it
yo who wants to finish these new league missions
wtf
like 90% of those look gross
diego
don't worry hes not a real wolf tho
and the full fuckin source
its hard enough coming back with good vision but when your wards just give the enemy more control you cant come back
zombie wards are way too snowbally
instead of sejuani and maokai
yea but they'll be doing it on lee sin and hecarim now
and they get a small lead
like you wont be able to leave ever if everything is zombie warded
I'm pretty sure preseason is just gonna be rampant carry junglers and really fast games that snowball off the zombie wards
and so theres no adc meta anymore
if we go back to farming/carry junglers theres nobody to protect the adc besides the supp
the adc meta is perpetuated by the fact tank junglers are meta and can protect the adc
yea but top has tanks/bruisers mostly rn anyway
how can you have an adc meta
in an era of invading assassins in the jg
are you telling me a lee/kha/kayn meta wont push out the adc meta
that's literally his whole playstyle
now hes even in levels again
get the rubberband xp off gromp and buffs
invade/camp for 5 minutes early
hes probably the biggest abuser of it
ez is shit jg
again without catchup xp
cause you stole all his farm and bullied him out of his jg
he cant sit in lanes after hes level 5 at 8 minutes
yea it does
all they have to do is bring it back and tank jungles go away again
getting counterjungled and being super behind kept sej and maokai and cho out of the jg meta
especially when shes not behind after she does
sejuani sitting in top lane for 5 minutes isn't skill
isn't skill
ganking until it works
the thing is though, vision + jungle control of both sides is skill
or your team literally didn't put a ward down on a single entrance
it was only cancer if you were bad at jg
10/10
cause no catchup + long respawn = fuck you youre two levels down forever
that meta where you could set their jg eternally behind by leaving the small monsters on a half of their jg was so good
and really fuck over a jg when you steal a few camps
so you can full clear yours then have time to counter
yea I want the 2 min respawn timer back
a laner
just like
you aren't straight farming. youre farming AND trying to deny their farm
so why would a jungler
no mid is gonna go for a kill and miss 15 cs
it just shouldn't be prioritized over farming
the benefit is still getting a kill
but they gutted it and now we have tank jg cancer
there was a time when getting 2 camps stolen was the same as giving the enemy jg a kill
you shouldn't be able to fail a gank and still be even
ganking should be a waste of time unless their lane is super behind/pushed
Poacherâ€™s Dirk buffs. The Poacherâ€™s Dirk no longer has a cooldown between enemy camps stolen, allowing for quicker stacking.
fuck you milo it works in ranked
or if you have your mid with you
ideally you'd literally only gank when youre strong enough to dive
there can never be too many changes that move jungling away from ganking
SNOW THEMED RIFT
Catch-up experience is only granted on Large or Epic Monsters. The amount per large monster kill is up, but the overall generated catch-up experience is going to be down substantially. Equally as important, thereâ€™s a clear path for an opponent to keep their enemy down further: donâ€™t give them access to large monsters.
you'd be basically even in xp
so as long as you were down a level or two but grabbed a raptor + wolf camp
it doesn't though cause raptors gave catchup on minis
so now you just get assassins or lee sin invading each other all game instead of tanks camping lanes and rubberbanding levels over the enemy for no reason
especially cause they got rid of the cooldown on poachers dirk
jungle meta is 100x better when invading is rewarded over ganking
nah I like the catchup xp removal
so you cant count cs to tell where their jg roughly is
also did you guys see the jungle changes. no catch up ex except on large monsters AND all camps are now 4 cs
no I think shes post op
might have to have someone there early
so if we  wanna do that we
its at dockweiller and apparently theyre first come first serv
we could get drunk there and tell ghost stories and shit
is it too late to get one of those beach fire-pits
its just really fun
its hella bad

&gt;predator boots
&gt;ardent nerfs
BRING BACK LEAGUE OF HECARIM RITO
for maximum geometry with vel
well I'm assuming ALL projectiles get refracted in this bubble
accurate pictures stolen directly from riot hq of the new champion
sparkly bubbles of skillshot deflection
and you can reflect skillshots in them
I'm calling it rn she makes bubbles
oh boy
and just like every other cancer champ hes put out, she has &quot;never before seen mechanics&quot;
and her theme is sparkles
guys the next champ is a burst mage by the legend who made yasuo kalista and new ww
id objectify her tbh
wheres the pbe squad
the girl obv
milo irl
if they nerfed armor
just like most people couldn't play most junglers
so YOU couldn't play kindred
which is a boring meta
also if they didn't buff armor the only junglers youd ever see are kayn, lee, elise, olaf
dying to towers and minions is cancer
I don't want to play dota I wanna play league
changing anything bigger is just an awful idea
if a small change like plants totally fucks with jungler playstyles
yea honestly fuck plants. give me the old smite buffs back
than by abusing the chaos
you could probably get to gold faster spamming meta shit like janna/lulu/trist/twitch
that's a great way for a company to go with their game
yea lets take a game that has a defined skillset and rankings based on your skills, and remake it so nobody's skill means shit
maybe even too much for one patch
the new stuff is enough already
why do you want us to have to play totally different AND adjust to new runes
they were just fringe which is why they got remade into a core mechanic
runes weren't a core system
and everyone hated it
junglers already have had to for like 3 years now
that defeats the whole point of improving
you shouldn't have to relearn core mechanics every preseason
me neither
also youd have to relearn how to trade in lane around minions
that would suck so they just kept it the same
aka learning how to last hit under tower all over again
I mean would you like it if you had to auto a melee, wait for it to take 2 hits, and then auto again
or minion armor
they didn't nerf jungle monster or minion ad you knokw
itd feel like absolute shit
adcs couldn't last hit yea
towers would be more dangerous
minions would be doing more damage early
on junglers
youd have less armor in the jungle
the net effect wouldnt
what do I do with my 36 ap page
I wish mages got base ap
so they didn't get adapted, instead they just gave everyone their base armor back
its just yellows that literally had no variation
like the ap quints you would've taken on ap became the adaptive stats from runes
combined with old masteries
and the reds/quints/blues became the new runes
so they just gave everyone the 10 they took normally
there wasn't a choice there
for armor
because yellows were literally only being used
or attack speed
ap
nah everyone takes cdr
but most people take armor yellows
because most people don't take mr blues
doesn't die
its also so everyone who can jungle
fuck you too
when
what is this
game sucks
getting surprise butt raped is probably better than playing smash tbh
look at this trash
I'm sure his internet is faster
I didn't time it
dude its a 30 second update
Michael irl
reported
youre
climbed gold faster than silver
but the enemies weren't good enough to punish mistakes
nah I liked playing in gold. the teams were good enough to be carried
everyones just trolling to not decay
does not suck
end of season d5
ez
then get out
get better on pbe
no brazillians

its right by san francisco
repent bitches
its the end times
first on earth and then in hell
the fags burned just like the good book said they would
nah if you fuck up publically you deserve to be fired
lol
girls in the troop would suck more than its worth
also then you get supervised way harder so nobody gets accused of sexual harassment or anything
its way worse if theres girls youre trying to impress
dude being gross as shit on a campout with no real showers is bad enough when its just your friends around
Fucking liberals ruin everything
Also, the boy scouts are now allowing girls into the troops
this is the best thing to ever happen
you can bind the flag to pop up at the start of a game

it was just too autistic to respond to
also I understood mars at first
therefore you cant be fat and a good person
weak self control = lack of character

at least shes confident tho

yay...
speaking of I have to go teach inner city nigger kids about computers

nah fam gotta win series

so are we team
I know you don't understand it but people who live together usually do things together
was having lunch with my roommates
I'm game
a trap probably wrote it
yea it is
team is triggered by the trap loving fags tho
team is kinda here
honestly thats where hes headed
hes on the path now
milo just cause you are a trap doesn't mean you get to say traps aren't gay
mars
wait thats so quality
it cant be that attractive
like its an androgynous looking mangirl
if you don't know if its a dude or a girl how hot can that actually be
the denial is deep
who? milo
gay as fuck
That's a lot of work just to conclude that traps are indeed
but trap tits aren't that big
fair
I really don't see how 500 a night is a lot
literally 3k a night for a bungalow
for the record the Beverly hills hotel milos at rn starts at 600 a night
lul
in brussels they brought out mussels
with a ton of drinks and food
nah, through Hilton or whatever they usually have a rooftop lounge/bar if you have a certain tier room or better
they had a huge open bar
at whatever place we were at in the netherlands
90% of the time
mars the wine is free in the lounges
it looks off of it
is that place even on the strip
butlers bringing you champagne on the rooftop while you gorge on a buffet of cured meats
its so worth it
and all the wine
also you get access to the executive lounges
thats almost half the day
youre in there 8-10 hours
its not a waste or blowing thats just the cost of a nice vacation
its half assing if you get the cheap tickets, rooms, no room service, no fancy dinners
mines going all out
I think we have different ideas of vacation
motel six?
if not a suite
where would you stay
a 500$ room fits all 4
and nobody stays in those shitty tier 3 rooms
is 450
literally the cheapest room
its about 500
room service
get a nice room
like thats the baseline
4x tickets is 6k
plane tickets 1.5k, hotels 500 a night
thats just torture
but that's not a vacation
like ok you can get a cheap vacation staying in ok places and flying economy
why would you stay at a three star hotel
what
3 star hotels
just the plane tickets are like 1.5 grand each
so what, you gonna sleep in a motel 6 an eat mickey Ds every night
maybe if you go to mexico they dont
vacations start at like 10000
....... the middle class cant afford to go on vacation
are really popular tourist towns
Beverly hills and santa monica
yea they do
theres an inverse correlation with wealth and weight
rich people
who goes on vacation
nigga wtf are you on
theres gotta be a bmi limit on getting rooms
like ever
those are the least attractive people ive seen at a nice hotel
so that it doesn't show her midriff
they nerfed eves splash art in other countries
its actually so good
you have zero sense of humor
you jew
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

maybe our high school was actually decently intellegent
&quot;putting burt's bees under our eyes so it would burn them, make them all red and make us look stoned. it was called beezing.&quot;
anon
meet me in the fucking bathhouse
wait so its just frostfall?
I'm totally ok with how it is
I only related to that by reading left to right
I need to play new xin
sure
shits dank
including mana and the old elixirs they removed
its like a sheen but instead of damage you get bonus gold and a chance at any elixir/potion
did you guys see the new keystone that lets you get consumables by hitting champs
whys he gotta be able to crit towers tho
but this is way better late
he did almost as much before
that's actually nuts
and 800 with his crit
lethality xin does 500 a hit to towers
yea
this doesn't beat awesomesauce
and the ahri announcer
the best thing is the star guardians
nope youre wrong
wtf
look at the map
wtf
shaped like a square
but its like a cartoony ram

that's what girls say

same
BUT FUCKING BLUE AS SHIT in game
in the art
why the fuck is tango eve blonde/pale
?????????
why the fuck would you want futures market
plus some stuff on ip changes
its on that page I linked
they released all the new rune and mastery stuff
press the attack is only good on like renekton with his resets and yi
sorcery and inspiration seem way better than precision domination
untimate hat lul
I'm gonna bm so hard with this
the t1 is 500, t2 = 1500, t3 = 2500
also theres that new emote for having x amount of hours played
and leaving lane with 5k health
is gonna be them just autoing each other forever
mao vs malph top
grasp gives stacking health lul
10/10 if youre good
and last forever
free wards you don't have to buy
by probably 10x
being real tho the zombie ward is better
is great if youre playing elise/lee/kha
I think the one where you get stacks for killing wards/champs
but only at higher elo
the wards are pretty good for junglers
but like domination on supports...
yea it looks great for supports
electro is 60-220 with .3ap
40-100 + .2ap
its damage isn't amazing either
or theyre REALLY bad and cant dodge the slowest skillshot ever
meteor only guarantees a hit when theyre super slowed or cced on your first cast
not when he qs
no cause it throws it when he e
and ori has a decently hard time proccing the speed without ulting
they don't have a good keystone
but for like ori or other mages who don't engage with hard cc
binding guarantees meteor lands
lux is an exception cause electrocute and meteor are the same for her
if electrocute was in sorcery itd be so good
my big issue is that sorcery keystones suck for the most part
press + overheal seems like one of the most oppressive lanes there is
shit like renekton with press the attack is gonna be cancer
resolve seems underpowered
tanks idk what they do
and assassins get domination-&gt;precision
whereas mages get ridiculous stuff like sorcery-&gt;inspiration
precision is good but all the other stuff is just meh on them
adcs don't have a good secondary path at all
honestly domination has some of the worst majors tho
just got a huge buff
every jungler that had a hard time pathing into a gank like xin
hextech flash is actually retarded on junglers
theres no minors now
its only keystones and majors
blink dagger in league lul
is it just me or does inspiration as a tree seem kind of op

talking to adrian
so people can trigger ardent

how to make literally any champ a support
dude if I ever find that fucker I'm hitting him with a frozen egg from my room
so I'm taking a sick day
someone pulled the alarm at 330
Lul 
all your 10k essence
which is dank af
some are champion minis
is all they said
&quot;an icon you don't own&quot;
so in preseason
right when levelling comes
a ton of cool ip based shit
mystery champs
mystery icons
for 150k
theyre selling urfwick
mars
get on the real server
milo you waited in q for 20 minutes cause nobody wants to play on pbe with its shit matchmaking
to get that champ you want
instead of play 2-3
you have to level again
and if you have smth like 6100 essence
only if you get the champ you want
compared to ip
the less you get
the more you play
assuming you just do 2 a day and get the first win
and scaling to 18% less
roughly 10% less early
we get less ip overall
oh yea also when the new levelling comes out
so are you ever gonna play
but worse than either
combined with anivia wall
now it feels like windwall
yea i liked how you couldn't cross it ever
yea the ult change sucks
or are we gonna play
are you guys gonna talk about league all night
actually maybe not cause that shit sucks
i want a pbe account...
mars did you miss the joke where milo doesn't have a pve account
so who plays on the pbe then
asking can I have one
what if I emailed riot
wait for real
fuck that nigger
good
what fucking emotes are these
and getting fucked up
wtf is with this half of the world
china doesn't get a ton of disasters either
like terror
all they get are human disasters
europe
you know who doesn't get natural disasters
theyre gonna say the same when we get an earthquake or smth

i think its gonna be xayah
whats the victorious skin this year
he bought the skin and everything
connor is an ez jg main now
his stream was good but now he just trolls
hes just a sellout
hed be good
if he could itemize crit well
ez jg is good cause he spikes earlier and doesn't deny his team a crit threat late game
better than graves
and gank well
cause you can counterjg easily
but like good
not op
dude i did it and it was decent
so idk how
and mained jg
honestly tho he sucked
basically
i got chatbanned last time i said nigger
no i said slave
not a nigger
what i called him was a monkey-related piece of shit fieldslave
also he claimed i called him a nigger
honestly I'm amazed autism gets this intense
but he was hitting on it anyway
i think their xayah was a dude
i said he should say egirl instead of hardstuck d5
I didn't even say I'm an egirl
normal lul
after we lost it turns out hes d3 and apparently plays with tardzaned a lot
then I told him the proper term is egirl at which point he started furiously hitting on me and xayah
its great
this kayn called me hardstuck d5 when he was 1/8 against plats
yea I'm d
its a really good title
like the whole town did nothing except the kids
&quot;it&quot; is something that children don't understand and fear but the adults choose to just ignore
before they finally beat the monster
that's why in the book they have to do &quot;it&quot;
sex
&quot;it&quot; represents the fear of children talking about se
no the title is perfect

I could hear Parsa breathing fast

I do wish league had invoker tho
He's also black
He can't tell sarcasm at all
remys a rampaging pussy
best part of dota was the OG dota buying 5 divine rapiers
doing nothing against some raging faggot with axes
10/10 it was really fun
becoming immune to spells/cc
your late game carry was always a melee with bkb
or it was when I played
mars its actually the meta
its like if yasuo also could buy olaf ult
at worst he kills one squishy rather than the whole back
yea but olaf isn't ALSO an adc
or literally becoming immune to cc and running down the backline
or the targeted stuns
mechanical skill? you mean global silence
in which case you just go grab it
its basically nothing unless you get it stopped
what is it 100g?
but it can be stopped
but everyone can for a bit more gold
mars its like how ornn can shop in lane
vs 175 x 5 but you can pick it up later
dead courier = all items destroyed and enemy gets 10% of their value
they shouldn't get the item
yea but they still get the item
and that way counterjungling and stopping invades was super huge
when you kill it
like say you steal 10% of the gold worth of items a courier is carrying
couriers would be cooler if you could legit steal items from them
why even bother
why
like FUCKING DAY/NIGHT cycles
but now its a useless additional mechanic
I think at some point it was cool cause people didn't know about it or how to get there
except theres a lot of items in the secret shops
and everything else at base
like if you had to buy black cleaver, sunfire, redemption at baron pit
the items at the secret shop are different
and no recall
or 2 shops that share all items
I think its better with one shop and the ability to recall
and people who make mods aren't good at writing
cause it was a Warcraft mod
hahahaha
fuck I forgot about that
MANGINA THE ANTI MAGE
turn times however long, day/night is pretty pointless, secret shop, buybacks
theres more than just that if you want dumb mechanics that don't add much
no his name is actually carl
carl the invoker
no its carl
invokers name is bob or smth
but not dota
parsa I want to team too
but not when you can just buyback
like you deserve to lose if its 50 min and you facecheck and they were there
but it doesnt
getting picked at 40 SHOULD mean you lose
buybacks are cancer
legit the last thing I ever want to do is play a moba for more than 45 minutes
and so you get 60 minute games way too often
their version of baron doesn't really guarantee the final push as well
closing out dota games sucks
melee carries are still better than ranged
its still a thing
but most importantly FUCK TURNING
last I played dota that shit took 15-20
wait in league first tower falls at like 8 min usually
the eye of Irma looks like a pokeball
aom &lt; aoe2
team
mars Irma is thicc
poopy can basically solo heal by taking bond of stone
I think the best team comp is poopy lux jinx ez mf
it was really fun tho
and need to be done on hard mode
almost all the missions require a full premade 5
GUYS PUNCHES CHILDREN IS AVAILABLE

I reached out to every champion in League of Legends, asking them for their opinion of the Emoji Movie. Hope you find this insightful!
Aatrox: so theseâ€¦ human vessels are also puppets of darkin devices, called phones. Albeit these darkin tools are embarrassments to the name! What Emoji would I need to send in order to start another great war, so that I may feast on the carnage? I found the firewall part most violent and uproarious. 3 out of 10.
Ahri: Jailbreak is such a confusing character to me. Why must she brag on and on about feminine power, yet refuse to use any sort of tact against Gene? I imagine a bit of seduction might have solved the plot. None of the characters acted realistically, meaning none of them were tormented by a carnal need for sensuous flesh. Where the hell was the fox emoji?! 1 out of 10.
Akali: I like movie theaters because they are draped in shadows, allowing for quiet movements, for secret moves in the dark. Thank the stars for this quality, because I was able to drop my shroud and leave the Emoji movie halfway inâ€¦ undetected. If I dashed to this movie I wouldnâ€™t get a reset, because it was DoAâ€”Dead on Arrival. 0 out of 10.
Alistar: Hoh-oh! Now when I heard they were doing a movie on Emojis, of all things, I snorted and said, â€œyou canâ€™t milk thoseâ€¦ for money!â€ Well, Hollywood, you managed to prove me both right and wrong. Perhaps it is for the best my kind was slain in cold blood, if the future is mere permission for movies like this to exist. The dancing scene needed more cowbell. 2 out of 10.
Amumu: Eâ€¦Everyone told me this movie was real popular on social media. So I went to make some new friendsâ€¦ but the theater was empty. As for the movie, I really liked the idea of an outcast making friends. Do human hands really speak and act like High-Five? I-If there are any humans out there, will you please let me be friends with your hand, at least? Anyâ€¦Anyway, my favorite scene in the whole movie was the fact Gene had parents who cared about him, because it allowed me to live on vicariously through the character. 8 out of 10.
Anivia: This movie was far, far below my age demographic, even if I was in my egg form. What strange mannerisms the humans outside of Frelijord have, sending emojis to one another in place of actual conversation! I am grateful the frigid colds keep the tribes of the Frelijord in check. Overall, I posit the movie was a cute romp for those unconcerned with the Watchers. This movie was surely unconcerned with its watchersâ€¦ 6 out of 10.
Annie: Wooooooow! This movie was a load of fun! My favorite scene was when, was when Gene fell into Candy Crush and Jailbreak went â€˜watch out!â€™ and the fruits went kablooey and Jailbreak and High-Five were like, aaaaah, he exploded! When I explode people in real life, they just leave vaporized blood in the air. I super loved all the poop jokes right in the beginning of the movie, they made Tibbers and I laugh until we cried. Good movie, good movie! Itâ€™s so weird, but a lot of people on the internet call me jailbreakâ€¦ or something like thatâ€¦ 10 out of 10!!
Ashe: I have better things to do as Queen than waste it on the Emoji movie. Although, after watching, I have realized the potential of these hieroglyphs. Already my carrier hawks deliver missives three times faster, when the contents are limited to these strange expressive symbols. Just yesterday I sent Tryndamere, the Barbarian King, an â€˜angry Emoji puffing steam through his nose,â€™ and he replied with a refrigerator. Anivia doesnâ€™t seem so happyâ€¦ 5 out of 10.
Aurelion Sol: So many fallen starsâ€¦ 0 out of 10.
Azir: ALL WILL BOW BEFORE SHURIMA! Sorry, obligatory plug for my empire. Recently arisen, full of vacation destinations, soon-to-be winner of the â€œI conquered Valoranâ€ award. Anyway, this movie insulted me. I risked everything to free the slaves of Shurima, just to see these fools become shackled to a new ruler called.. smartphone. Gene, Jailbreak, all of the Emojis, will bend the knee to me, their new emperor, or suffer a consequence far unsolvable even by the Ascendant powers of Dropbox. 4 out of 10.
Bard: waning, distorted blooping noise. Gleeful chirp. Recalcitrant bing. High, deafening screech. 7 out of 10.
Blitzkrank: Cute visuals with a predictable plot, this dime-a-dozen blockbuster failed to grab me. 3 out of 10.
Brand: OH MY GOD, AM I ON FIRE?! Oh, no, that would be the fuming dumpster this movie was conceived in. Every second in the theater was like a year caught in Liandryâ€™s Torment. The dancing scene went on way too long, and this is coming from someone who had a part in Thriller. 1 out of 10.
Braum: Light-hearted and charming, though very, very dumb. I would ask the children in the audience to stand behind meâ€¦ and wear some earplugs. 4 out of 10.
Caitlyn: It is time to solve a mysteryâ€¦ the mystery of how a movie like this comes into production over Popeye. Maybe I should don my Pulsefire suit, go back in time, have a spot of tea with Sony. If they refuses to listen to reason, Iâ€™ll try againâ€¦ bring along Vi. The most tolerable scene was the dance segment at the end. The Emoji pop is sure to take off here in the UKâ€”I mean, Piltover! 3 out of 10.
Camille: Makes me wonder if my cause, to defend the wealthy elite, is righteous when they put out trash like this. This movie belongs more in the sewers of Zaun than on the big screens of our cultural mecca, it is an utter affront to proper moviemaking technique. 2 out of 10.
Cassiopeia: Does anyone have the producersâ€™ addresses? Iâ€™d like to have a face-to-face with them. The antagonist was inspiringly snakelike in her motivations, although I would be less than enthused to mayor over a city of large, two-legged expressions. My only expressions are secretions, from my fangs. 6 out of 10.
Choâ€™gath: I RESPECT THESE SMALL CREATURES KNOWN ONLY AS EMOJI. THEY DROVE AN EXISTENTIAL FEAR INTO MY HEART I HOPE TO ONE DAY INFLICT ON OTHERS, HA HA HA! 8 out of 10.
Corki: If you think the theatrical release was bad, I watched the on-flight entertainment edition. 0 out of 10.
Darius: A slam dunk in terms of cruel torture. Jailbreak is a hero to Noxus, a woman who fights beyond her status. Not enough murders shown on-screen. 5 out of 10.
Diana: Yadda yadda yadda, itâ€™s pure lunacy. Want to know what I really think? It is just a stupid movie in a long list to ignore until we need a movie to distract the children. All these unwarranted reactions serve to make it more popular, thus inspiring more, thus encouraging us to hate more. I plan to give it a forgettable score and move on with my life. Howâ€™s that response for a lunatic, bitch? (Went to the midnight screening). 6 out of 10.
Dr. Mundo: Mundo goes where he pleases. So Mundo did not go see this.
Draven: Yâ€™know, I sympathize with Gene. The poor guy has too much emotion, too much pizazz for the boring world he was plopped down in. You know what he should take up? Executionâ€¦ing. Start with that high-five friends of hisâ€”I can teach him to twirl a few axes, take off those fingers one by one. It will be more entertaining than the majority of this filmâ€”because the movie was boring, and Iâ€™m draaaaaven. 3 out of 10.
Ekko: I can only go back about 4 seconds in time. Worse still, I spent hours and hours of time-resets, trying to convince a mother of three to see another movie. Sheâ€¦ she just wouldnâ€™t listen no matter what I did. Why canâ€™t I save everyone?! WHY?! 0 out of 10.
Elise: Got bored, started to walk around and scare people as a spider. Built a web in the theater, took a nap near the projector. Movie was bad enough that everyone walked out screaming halfway through. And, by the way, what was up with those product placements? We are all in big businessâ€™s web, now. 4 out of 10.
Evelynn: My late husband would have said the movie is okay. And you all wonder why Iâ€™m a widow. In the scene with Jailbreak and Gene on the boat, I ha..

The protagonist of the story is Ebony (occasionally Enoby or Egogy) Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, a seventeen-year-old vampire who attends Hogwarts (located in England instead of originally Scotland) as a member of Slytherin House. Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two cliques, the goths and the preps. Ebony and all the sympathetic characters are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of Harry Potter are given &quot;goffik&quot; [sic] makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.
...ok
The story begins by focusing on Ebony's relationship with her boyfriend Draco Malfoy, who is depicted as a shy, sensitive bisexual. After learning that Draco used to date the vampire known as Harry &quot;Vampire&quot; Potter, Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets Lord Voldemort. Voldemort demands that she kill &quot;Vampire&quot; Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits suicide by slitting his wrists.
Has this person even read HP? What even
After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a My Chemical Romance concert in Hogsmeade. The concert is crashed by Voldemort and his Death Eaters, but Ebony and Draco are rescued by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a poseur and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.

In this series, I will be ascribing sexuality ratings to each champion in League of Legends. Mind you that I have ample evidence for each claim and will cite champion lore, players who main the champion and my own personal experience as a hypothetical ethnographer from Piltover.
For those of you who are new to the Kinsey scale, it is essentially a chart that allows oneâ€™s sexual orientation to be placed upon a 0 through 6 scale. In the Kinsey scale, a 0 represents completely heterosexual (e.g. Rivington the 3rd), while a 6 represents completely homosexual (e.g. Rivington the 3rd in my newest fanfiction, â€œRiveting Rivington Goes to 3rd Baseâ€).
While there are many flaws to the Kinsey scale, some that will be revealed over the course of our expedition into League champion sexual orientation, it remains one of the most helpful and practical tools for discussing sexuality. So without further ado, I will begin with none other than our rework prone edgelord, Aatrox.
Aatrox, the Darkin Blade:
Having blood as your secondary resource bar might be edgy, but is it as edgy as being a gender queer preteen being possessed by a weapon that represents war? No. But lucky for Aatrox heâ€™s got all that and more pushing him over the edge that his homie (partner?) Rhaast has guarded so mercilessly. Sadly, the Kinsey scale does not account for the possession of an individual by a weapon, but I sure as hell do. As both a weapon in search of a sheath and a angsty edgelord in search of attention, I give Aatrox a 4 on the Kinsey scale: Predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual.
Ahri, the Nine-Tailed Fox
If you rule34 Ahri you will see more than you would ever want to see, but the one thing you wonâ€™t see, is her Kinsey scale rating. Thatâ€™s where unlike Ahriâ€™s body, I have you covered. Being the incredibly sexual succubus that she is, this foxy soul eater devours the memories of her victims in a compassionately intimate manner. Regardless of their gender, Ahri can find compassion for an individual even if they are trying to deceive her. This was the case with Hirin, a woman who attempted to steal Ahriâ€™s tails. For this I give Ahri a 3: Equally heterosexual and homosexual.
Akali, the Fist of the Shadow
I must admit that I have never played Akali. However, this does not mean that I am unable to provide an accurate Kinsey scale rating for the young ninja. I went over to the Akali mains subreddit to further my knowledge of Akaliâ€™s sexual orientation where users either ridiculed my efforts to understand Akali or gave her a 3 citing â€œsymmetry in all thingsâ€.
Alistar, the Minotaur
Once again, I turned to the subreddit of male cow mains to uncover more around Alistarâ€™s sexual orientation. The best answer I heard from their responses was from /u/Gjallock suggested that the Minotaur was in fact a hornsexual.
Amumu, the Sad Mummy
â€œDoomed to exist in a broken state of emptiness, eternally alone and friendless,â€ Amumu mirrors the exact state of existence of gay youth in our world. Tragic as it may seem, Amumuâ€™s desire for a friend he can never have, due to his untimely curse, reflects the struggle of gaining allies as a member of the LGBTQ community. That struggle being the inevitable moment that you have to tell a newly met friend what curse you harbor, and sometimes that new acquaintance simply cannot handle the facts of your existence. For this I give Amumu an X, which on the Kinsey scale represents an absence of â€œsocio-sexual contacts or reactions.â€
Anivia, the Cryophoenix
Sheâ€™s an ice phoenix, which quite literally means that she reproduces asexually. For this reason I give Anivia an X.
Annie, the Dark Child
Annie has not reached sexual maturity. For this reason I will not be placing her on the Kinsey scale.
Ashe, the Frost Archer
Being married to Tryndamere would obviously prove Ashe to be a heterosexual archer queen, but perhaps there is more to it than meets the eye. I mean, have you not heard Tryndamere commenting about the strength of his right arm over his left? Perhaps this provides more insight into the sex life of the power couple. Iâ€™m just saying, maybe Tryndamere is left out in the cold more often than not. Maybe Ashe is doing something else, leaving Tryndamere to fend for himself. Maybe Ashe is doing someone else. Why else would she flaunt around the rift exclaiming, &quot;How do you like the curves? I was talking about the bow.â€ While all this is very unlikely, it is not impossible. And have you noticed all that tension between those other Freljord Queens? For this I give Ashe an 1: Predominantly heterosexual, only incidentally homosexual.
Aurelion Sol, the Star Forger
Tricked by the Targonians after donning a crown, Aurelion Sol became a tool of warfare and destruction. With the power to create stars and a past shrouded in an ambiguous creation myth, Aurelion Sol, like so many others of his magnitude, is above sexual orientation. For those Sol will receive an X on the Kinsey scale.
Azir, the Emperor of the Sands
Reading through Azirâ€™s lore, like so many othersâ€™, reminds me of the tragedy porn that so often falls upon the reader without triggering even the most miniscule response of empathy. However, Azirâ€™s story was different. Adopting a slave, Xerath, due to a shared interest in the scholarly arts, was just the start to a homo erotic oasis in a desert of heteronormative boredom. Over the years to come, Azir and Xerath would do everything together. They would explore the great library of Nasus, chart the stars and even kill an assassin or two hundred together. This is not to say that Azir is exclusively homosexual as in his lore it states that he, â€œmarried and fathered numerous children, some by wedlock, others by ill-advised liaisons with slaves and harem girls.â€
According to the lore, Xerath, harbored a hatred towards Azir for not freeing all slaves, but as Azir began the ascension ritual, required to become a demigod, Azir freed Xerath alongside all other slaves. This should have set Xerathâ€™s angst to rest for good, but in actuality Xerath was not resentful of Azir for this. Azirâ€™s freeing of the slaves of Shurima revealed a much more tragic flaw in Xerath. Xerath had spent his entire life trying to help Azir abolish slavery. But even in success, Xerath was incomplete. His vexation, while partially fueled by the chains of inequality, was in fact powered by something entirely different; jealousy. Jealousy of the lovers Azir had taken while his own body had been thwarted. What love the two once had for each other had been extinguished by the carnal desires for more. With every woman, every slave and every harem girl Azir coupled with, Xerathâ€™s jealousy grew. So upon that fateful day, after Azir fulfilled his promise to his lifeâ€™s partner, he was betrayed. He was betrayed not out of hatred fueled from a life enslaved, but out of love. Love that only existed in Xerathâ€™s nights spent longing over a future that could never exist. Tragically, Azir just wasnâ€™t that into Xerath. And it is for this reason that I have given Azir a 2: Predominantly heterosexual, but more than incidentally homosexual. It is worth noting that post-ascension Azir has an X rating on the Kinsey scale for obvious reasons.
A special thanks to those redditors who responded in the champion mains subreddits I interviewed.

have you ever heard the tragedy of darth plageius the wise
dude irish people eat the bird puffins
hype
meme patcht
but also its not like I cant run that and many other things in the back easily
I did
team
and reksai gunblade dreams
memes
this is just ADVANCED free shit
there already was free shit
lets be real tho 95% of the time its gonna be tokens
seems op
2 gems or hextech annie/ss vayne/dreadnova darius
Missions: 
Weâ€™re testing out new missions themed toward Chaos and Order. Complete missions to earn exclusive rewards and to unlock new missions. 
Loot: 
We are introducing limited-time loot weâ€™d like you to test. Earn Order and Chaos Tokens by completing missions (or purchase them in the Store) to unlock special Icons, Borders, Emotes and Orbs. You can also purchase passes themed toward Order or Chaos, which grant you a Hextech Chest &amp; Key, an Orb, a unique Ward, a multiplier that doubles the amount of tokens you earn on missions, and mission lines exclusive to the passes. 
Orbs contain a guaranteed Legacy skin shard and a 50% chance to get a bonus drop. If your orb triggers a bonus drop, youâ€™ll have a chance to get either a random amount of Tokens, two Gemstones, or a loot-exclusive skin shard. 
Completing the special mission lines rewards you with Hextech Chests, Hextech Keys, Tokens, and even Gemstones.
this is the same theme as kayle and morg
emo motherfucker
but riven shits on yas
also hes really down to box the bitch
you little shit
but you know it IS the light so maybe just don't be edgy yas
and I'm pretty sure the unsaid implication is he doesn't want to obey god so hes killing people
his whole voiceover is about how hed rather kill a bunch of people than obey
yasuo_irl
&quot;no way I'm just some edgy cuck&quot;
&quot;sure I'm a demon fighting angels but shit, IM right and theyre wrong&quot;
that's some delusional shit
you cant really say youre on the right side
I mean maybe if you can admit youre a demon
and yas is just die
kneel or die
rivens really hitlery
angel yas would've been way cooler
man why does yas have to be the edgy one
fuckin weeb
wait yea
I want tirion back
is stupid
fuckin new age demon crap
idk. now I miss arthas
I swear he voices a dragon or cult member in wow
but like the gravelling is definitely familiar
its not like only one person can talk like that
was he one of those twisted ascendant fucks
or maybe one of the faceless
from cata
dude I swear theres a dragon or smth that sounds like this yas skin
nah illidan is much higher
the dragon twins maybe
one of the twilight cult bosses?
or
I think he might be illidan
he is a raid boss
bitch looks like ghost rider
and not fiery
it looks like its supposed to be shadowy
you see what I mean right
its this
dude his splash has like 2 touches of red
and not that
his splash looks like this was gonna be the theme
fuckin vishnu
and not bright and red
aren't demons all dark and shadowy
yas is a pretty skinny dude
so fucking bad
also yas skins hair is just
to make it fit these
so this is why they nerfed her animation times
dude not even counting that
or like tahm too
on that skin
does she only say her demon lines to yas
that hip ratio
its worse now
I thought this was supposed to be a Michael Lucifer thing where they don't want to fight
they hate each other
oh
if it didn't talk to the yas one
I actually like the riven skin
its just hitlery
its not that she doesn't have a point
also that yas ult is really bad
yea but her quotes are angel hitler
thicc
is angel hitler
the same way the legendary kayle skin
I like how riven is angel hitler
than yas
rivens better
its literally Michael and Lucifer but the league version
I think the quotes and the skins aren't good
one slash isn't as cool as his 3 teleporting ones
although his skin ult is fuckin dumb
lmao
yas nerfs right when the skin comes out
also whos going to the wonder woman movie
no but this is TIME scaling on health
that's fuckin weird
his tree duration scales on his health
for some reason
maokai still exists
you move up pretty quickly from 1-3
is enough
10 games of getting 4 honors even if its all your friends
you can honor friends dude
and its clean
yea but like if one of you drops to 1 we just honor you back to 2
so I don't get the point
but friends can honor you back up
and getting bans drops you
which is where you start
but you have to be honor level 2+
key
like you shop a while after a game and boom
instead of after a win
and like when you login
but the keys will randomly show up after games
actually they said afking doesn't count. you have to que
hey man afk in client and farm fragments
and apparently so long as you get no bans you get them
Keys no longer drop at end-of-game, but periodically while outside of queue.
10/10
it comes out a perfect crisp of cheese and its genuinely addictive
shred and bake it at 350 for 5 minutes
guys I found a new way to eat cheese
if you take 50k a year youre getting really ripped off for your labor
alligators
and rare rains
with neither snow nor heat
id rather live between 50-80 degrees
I love this shit
this is nice af
you don't need socal to be happy but its a hell of a lot easier to be happy in constant sunshine and nice weather
and any significant amount cheaper
cause nowhere else will be as nice
but do you all really think so little of yourselves that you don't think you could live here
its not so bad really
and everythings spotless cause servants
but at the same time theres air filters
trust
and itd still be smoggy
dude you could own a 20 million dollar mansion there
city perks
that's smog lul
and a pool
servants
hey man
and theyre only like 400 a month
I'm pretty sure this neighborhood comes with servants
1.6 million for a mansion in the nice parts of taipei
although
I think all of you have way too little expectations of your careers and yourselves. Its hard but not that hard to live here
Colorado freezes in winter
its hell
Minnesota rains without clouds
I mean why the fuck would you want to live in pennsylvania
median pay is dragged down by service jobs here
last time I went there I visited him somewhere close to the bridge
I didn't exactly ask him his address
its not a significant amount different
equally expensive though
its definitely possible to save up the money
dude the guy I worked with at the mech e lab just got a house in the bay area
6 years you can save up 150k
4 years phds
2 years grad
not 300k maybe 150
work a job then and get the money
yea but the downpayment you can save up during your grad years
that's how you get a house
who doesn't get a loan in their 20s
or a loan from the bank
and youre set
give it 5 years
but its not like its out of the world impossible
so maybe not every field can start off owning a place here
etc
marketing
they have other departments
theyre some of the fastest growing companies
apple
amazon
out of college
that will pay 100l+
theres a lot of companies here
blizzard if youre lucky
tesla
salesforce
qualcolm
teradata
microsoft
LinkedIn 110k
120k with stock
facebook at 120j
and theyre here too
snapchat and shit starts higher
and theyre notorious for underpaying
nah googles starting pay is 120k
on scholarship
most of them are immigrants
lul
and bought a house 20 years ago
yea phd students are rich
a lot of the phds I worked in the lab with own a place
so if you move its cheaper but you also get paid less
depending on field
e
to live her
the jobs here pay enough
why would you move this area is great
but has better ones at 8k
starts one bed at 2.6
I think the company doing that building
its the tiny no yard ones still pushing 1.5
wait houses here are almost all 2 million
and Adrian used to live
where the 400 sq ft houses are
between the highway and pico
typical
like jerrys house vs right on the pier
depends where you wanna live
dude move into nathans abasement
lul
kindred prepatch
but with more choices
or stormraiders
its like how you play around thunderlords in lane
do some troll shit like berserk ad tf
those rune pages are actually really cool
maybe we just all take turns honoring each other lul
I want free shit without being nice
on the other
I mean on one hand new runes that actually affect gameplay
like 3/5th season
mid-midseason?
nah this is probably for the midseason update
but stronger
also new runes are like keystones
R I P my loot
&quot;honor gives key fragments and additional content&quot;
rakan concept art

black kids don't need to dress up even

wow I didn't even see india in there
so its not half the world really
all those countries don't have the population of india+china
or the &quot;Americas&quot; server
so its already the best in the sense of being the hardest to climb
I think NA has the most hearthstone players
can we call him fag
since nobody cares about ping in HS
its about languages not actual physical stuff
they don't include Australia cause they cant communicate on the asia server
cause in league they are his
doom and gloom up in his que
mom and dad and parsly always giving him commands
teamothy turn her

they ffed at 15 lul
wtf is this game
so ive ran into a kindred AND a ww worse than parsa in ranked
really it just made me want to play
it didn't really make me buy rp but it got me to spend a little of what i had
and arcade is better than tpa

and just say &quot;bitch you should've done shit&quot;
straight up wreck him in the review then show it to him before you turn it in
but everyone sadly does their part :/
man wtf. if I ever had the chance to roast my teammates for not doing shit id do it so fast
when really this is a great opportunity
you sound down about it
let him fail
wait you should crucify that fucker in your peer review
isnt
60 base damage for .4 ratio
at least that's debatable

1.6 ratio on second q

literally the least impactful nerf ever
16/0/2
new graves is op
i wonder why
they gave her for free for a lot of people
everyone does
hes got a cigar again tho

and auto for 1k
dude just get 6 items
I'm pretty good at him
i know how to right click
implying anyone cant be a competent graves lul
also i did that eye thing once lol
but like you choose to play kha
you could already climb easily if you played kha and graves
so that you fuckin rinse your eyes out with water
and open it
is get a water bottle and put it over your eye
dude what you gotta do
so eye drops?
that lux is a tool
Edited previous message: also why would you pay someone to boost you with champs you don't play<e_m ts="1495049753" ts_ms="1495049754863" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
instead of ones you do
also why would you pay someone to boost you with champs you don't plat
well apparently you don't get banned for it
etc
0 this season
61% ez on 30 games
and 0 this season
with 60 games last season
72% panth winrate
that's like not even trying to hide your boost
with a 44% winrate
then fell to plat 3
and placed plat 1
got masters from diamond right at the end of last season
we saw the most obvious boosted lux ever
by inting harder than i do top?
pesto ruins everything
its a throwing pizza
its not an eating pizza
like a fucking broccoli, no tomato sauce, pineapple, half cheese pizza
and seen which starving freshman is desperate enough to eat it
and thrown it over the wall
then taken it to samo

whens your class over
fuck you cuck
are you at school
fuck
as
emo
sad
tsm was our best
off of fucking tsm
they finally got it
guys skt has the unofficial world championship title again
fucking intel commercials
electro music is so gay. spam a note and the ones within 4 steps chromatic
oh good its over
its the instrumentals to &quot;wake up....shit shit shit smth makeup&quot; in the background
are they playing system of a downs on stream
tsm lost to this wtf
and so bad at actually ending the game
how are GAM so good at winning early
rip GAM
even with 5k ahead at 10 they'll probably win
theres not much to do tho
at least gigabyte tried to fight
g2 slowly died
they got more kills but lost faster
which is really impressive considering they weren't trying
they fiesta-d vs gigabyte but never lost a tower
only korea plays like they actually understand the map
eu didn't look good either
sad
c9 died for tsm to int on stage
her issue is never gap closing
nah I think redsmite-&gt;magus-&gt;sorc-&gt;mask is better
tsm should import him
levi is pretty good
and eve
old protobelt elise was nuts
I think magic pen elise is better lol
proccing tlord with ludens hits gives like 2-300 more damage
same as elise q-auto actually
but now its q-w-ludens-thunderlords
ori q-w used to just be q-w
that probably pixel perfected him
there was one on bjerg
half of that game is also the fact that faker has bigger shockwaves than anyone else tho
that bang kid is pretty good too
or the first thing
that's the one thing you need to beat skt imo
ez game
then win the other 2 lanes
and actually does things
get a mid that wont get clapped
you know the trick to beating skt
we lost to OCE
that game was a 3v5
oh yea and bjerg didn't exist
the story of sven
&gt;holy shit why did peanut fist me
&gt;get greedy and punished in NA
&gt;do it at MSI
of all time
sven is the most wasted ass import
kha invading lee makes no sense
wtf is that lb chain range
lee competitive is hard cause people play around your invades and ganks cause theres real vision and communication
peanuts lee fists you for 20 min till you ff
graves just wins you the late game
I would. lee is much harder to deal with than graves
and not be a joke
legit the one lee player who can use god fist
but hes also the only good lee
he can play elise kha rengar graves etc
and they banned graves
only one who didn't feed with lee in lck when he wasn't meta
but peanut is 12-0 on lee
then again this season theyre undefeated on almost everything they play
this season
better ban his worst jg
peanut is undefeated on lee
why did tsm ban graves lmao
so its pretty easy to look good
galio is stupid op tho
stark either gets clapped or carries
op
Vietnam jungle
only peanut unironically uses god fist
that might be the worst score ive seen this season
who the fuck goes 0/7 competitively
but I do it in ranked and I get banned
wait why is sven allowed to int on stage
worst part is kha is good against lee
the definition of clapped
me_irl
like milo
he used to have longer hair
hes actually funny tho
actually he makes youtube videos
hes decently rich
its YDCB hes a streamer for summoners war

so were just not allowed to have good cards now
but nothing that clears a 3 hp stealth
theres a lot of 2 damage clears
which is worse by far than infinite/3
so really its infinite/2
you only need it to deal 1 to kill anything
bad design
that's just
1/4 instead of 2/3
and cobra
instead of 1/3\
and 2 attack
with poison
why do they make minions like giant wasp
that dog is gonna die of complications in a year
for all you know only you can see his real size and color

also does anyone else think new zac is actually kind of busted. 2 ways to move their adc into your team is insane
lul
I was just memeing him
actually tho someone add him back
r e p l a c e d
play osrs
dude use it yourself
there it is
oh shit
I don't check my twitch prime ever
dude idk where it is
old school runescape was literally my life

hell yes
dank
^him_irl
and stupid Japanese people sounds

all I hear
we know you left to whack it

she accuses everyone else of fapping
lul
hand in the bush
ever wonder why joy is so quiet
I swear on me mum
parsa ill kick you m8
Its time
no wonder jennah and jeane play
clan?
meirl
dude, i honestly dont even like the chainsmokers
Sorry, i have a boyfriend
didn't see your text
new duck game maps
we desperately need something
guys
lul wheres clan
clansmen where are you
clan?
whats the substitute for team
are you saying I should've removed him
azir is cancer and I hope he always stays suboptimal
she can go athenes lol
also he loses lane to her
can straight up one shot him at a lot of times
can impact a teamfight just as much late
ori has more impact early
that makes no sense
and azir is weak af to them
I think syndra and ori will still be good
and stronger early games
hes countered by better laning mages
azir isn't countered by tanks and items
but now theyre equally fucked like adcs
was hard cause armor gave so much health
syndra can kill tanks again ayyyy
like varus, jhin, vayne, kog
plus there are adcs with % health to counter tanks still
it balances
tanks take less damage but have less health
itll even out imo
so the less health is buffing them
still
yea but theyre % based
and cleaver
ads will be fine because last whisper
I always liked mages more anyway
will actually ruin the last assassins
tanks with more cc
assassins got fucked mid season tho
ad casters are like ez, jhin, lethality varus, etc
those are all assassins or bruisers
ez is basically the last one
ad casters
ap is still better to have more of than ad
point is unless these mr items are super busted
also mr is bad on tanks because towers
and no tanks do true damage
youd need a lot of true/percent health damage to make it ok
if you ever get it you lose the splitpush
its the fastest way to lose your lane
for maybe 1750 worth of stats
2500
I think its just so shit because all they do is ignore you until it wears off and kill your team
so basically its for zac
because of a lot of cc
its for tanks who can afford to be ignored damage wise
literally ignored in a fight
&quot;look I'm super tanky and do no damage&quot;
gargoyle stoneplate is such a fucking noob trap wtf
idk where to find the rest of the items
still not a big nerf to the popular mages like syndra ori ahri
that's it
adaptive help kills cass and ryze
I don't think the new mr items will change much
yea but for now 2-3 ap and adc is so good
and theres no mr item like thornmail
mr is harder to itemize because the finalized items give less
I think a full ap comp is better than full ad
some people who cant see my chat
some people always instalock zed tho
unless your mid and jg already are ap
honestly the best solution is don't go ad mids lol
no early game
kayle sucks ass
cause it makes the team play around you
point is ad mids are selfish picks
or top is lulu
or makes your top laner play rumble/kennen
it shafts your jg into going ap which means elise basically
I actually don't like people who pick ad mids
dumb motherfuckers don't know what ap is
actually just dodged cause our mid wanted to go fuckin zed with a darius top
or support mages
but like on my soloq people hover and pick control mages
yea. on jerrys account I see a ton of assassin types mid
if not supp
brand karma lulu and shit go mid now
after they nerfed mages supp
never seen vel
the fuck?
its all ahri syndra talon zed
no vlad no cass anymore
I see way fewer vlads now tho
weak early is like the worst thing to be in a jg
take too fucking long to become effective
fiddle kindred yi udyr whatever
which is cancer
that have no impact till past 6
also people still play farming or slow scaling jgs
no we said jg is boring
ww is pick/ban almost in my experience
or play around it
nobody tries to actually think of where their jg is
the real problem with jg is that everyone takes the same boring ass standard routes
cause nid only needs blue so she gives up red
nah you can path around lee with nid
more counterjg pressure than almost anyone else
nid is really good when youre good at nid
every other role has more tier 1s
elise nid grag lee kha graves rengar
honestly the least diversity is in junglers
its actually diverse
and fiora/Camille/darius
but tanks
theres a ton of ap carries
who even goes top
enchanters just aren't as fun
I'm just sad mage supports got fucked up
but you cant meme about that
actually I think its balanced rn
cigar &gt; balance

more importantly if people dont touch it their gear doesnt improve so i think people will at least have to interact with crafting their own shit at some point
although mars is an alchemist technically
yea i figured which is why im insisting everyone at least read it for their 1 mix
and i can guess already what youre gonna say so say it
eh mars already said some positive shit
im asking how youre gonna phrase it
im asking how youre gonna phrase it
im asking how youre gonna phrase it
if i ask you what you think of the crafting and the alcehmical creations and stuff am i gonna get flamed
not an hour. like 20 minutes or whenever christina is done and wants to go watch tv
league
xd
or smth like minecraft. or league and i die a lot
something i can play while writing
smth chill tho
ye
government officials can worship but gods outside the bolded list range from mildly heretical, like paganistic, to major outcasts like hardcore satanists
government officials can worship but gods outside the bolded list range from mildly heretical, like paganistic, to major outcasts like hardcore satanists
no thats just a meme
but also yes unless you think an openly satanist councilmember should be a thing
speration of church and state you know
as a member of the government you shouldnt be endorsing any gods
negus?
i should do hw or campaign after tho
i can do one game rq
Dinner
even then UA ranger is fine
isnt the first ranger revised not UA
youre all from the empire in some way or another
likely
mountain steppes and an ancient grove forest
sinkhole biome
a salted shore area
a cloudtop rainforest
deep feywild connections
island is kinda like ionia where theres lots of stray magic that needs to be balanced or it lashes out
little japanese ish outpost town still. not santa monica
and being part of rei's empire but 200 years after
and settled on the outpost being on that little island south of Hakone 
i actually built a bunch of what i wanted next campaign to be
not in the feywild
blue maybe?
on pink/red grass
cant figure out what a good aesthetic color for trees is tho
i got like 2 areas left
turns out i wanted a denser map than i thought
15?
finishing a map
right on 30 minutes
aight
yea i have to defrost bacon and boil an egg
gimme 30 minutes
im making avacado toast
rip
yea
you ever tried dnd with video and call
i c. well if you have 60 bucks i recommend it
i feel like its just better right
how come you dont draw on tablet or smth else digital
lmao
its been 30 and nobody has
pretty sure nobodys coming
big old squid
doesnt have to be. its again just a beast
big demon fight is the real one
honestly tho cutting it out is chill
you could. but its more of a curious kraken just restraining people and inspecting them and shit or smth
and then they beat it together with rei and some goons
almost fed to a kraken
so they get dicked around on a small boat
because consequences. invading sovereign territory and more importantly insulting your host is one of the biggest fae crimes
thats a win
and pushed him back to hell
they got the objective
for a few rounds
did fine into that
and the ability to mind control 2 as a bonus action
with 3 LE and +16 to hit
the full level 20 godmode one
they fought letho
every big monster theyve fought has had la
and that thing removes limbs
meh. im hitting them with buffed demogorgon later
so no fight works too
yea exactly
and leaves after taking solid hits
kraken fight is more interesting cause it just takes that big bolt and tests them for a bit
nah thats pointless tho. it doesnt reaffirm rei as a needed ally and just wastes time
rest of their fights were unaided
only one fight
like last session
the underworld
an archfey can be a patron too
theyre beasts of the land
offending the archfey
they cant possibly survive having their boat torn in half and fighting a kraken
whats better. titania tries to feed them to a kraken. a)rei shows up and blasts the kraken with a boat cannon and it leaves or b) short pointless fight 
thats dank
yea
with a guy
sure hes gonna beat them up
its just bullet points essentially
ik whats meant to be on there
i mean it doesnt really matter im the only one ever gonna read it
and chad and thad are JUST weird gold constructs
actually itd just be easier to have mab and titania be the ones working with the champion
taken over by the champion in secret 
cause there should be hints and eventually reveal that chad and thad and all the other  brothers are just constructs
ultimately it should also make them really hate nilgesh's champion
in 1 session
yea unless they put together 1 million dollars
good boy points will be a slightly less shitty boat
so nothing short of NOT doing that is enough
but ultimately they did bring the harsh winter and summer
if they pipe up and try to solve the problem it may be a lesser punishment
unless they really just bro down with chad
but nothing they can say can stop the punishment
yea there should be various breaks
then charters a ship down the divide until she comes upon them
canonically she probably checks the teleportation circle at their estate and hears from morozov they were exiled
anyway after a while drifting miserably at sea rei finds them and brings them in and session finishes
and the curse of mab prevents teleportation
getting off the boat in a flying carpet will
getting off the boat in a flying carpet will
attempting to get off the boat in any port under a ruler that isnt a friend will set it off
attempting to get off the boat in any port under a ruler that isnt a friend will set it off
attempting to get off the boat in any port under a ruler that isnt a friend will set it off
attempting to get off the boat in any port under a ruler that isnt a friend will set it off
the mark of the traitor should be like the sword of damocles
the mark of the traitor should be like the sword of damocles
the mark of the traitor should be like the sword of damocles
consequences, for offending the fae and a host of other divine karma
even if chad and thad say bro a lot more and shit like that
more an outline than set dialogue but the events remain the same
these are the rough notes for the start of the session
Winter came early to Daggercourt. The frigid winds of winter blew through Thaeron, causing massive crop failures and famine. On the 5th of May, 1121 Calamity's End, a Duke's Eye comes to the estate accompanied by two members of the Church. Morozov hears him out and at dinner that night, passes on the news. &quot;It seems the Duke is asking noble houses to pay a greater sum to the relief efforts. Doubly so for us, as the church has caught wind of what goes on here. They say they will both overlook our actions for a lump sum of fifty thousand gold. Lin and I think it is fair that we put forth half, as we are not solely responsible for this place. Vyrmias has graciously put down nothing and simply ignored me, so that comes out to twenty five thousand gold, if you would.&quot; 

The rest of the months are harsh indeed. Even the Academy ceases operation in June, the remnant Arcana of the Nexus needing to be doled out for emergency plant growth. The guild sees less dues than usual and Gale pushes for the guild to actually donate funds and goods to the city, as a gesture of faith and to cement it in the hearts of the people. They would overlook some theft and extortion, likely. Even the non-humans seem to feel winter's chill. The Dwarven lords retreat to Black mountain and leave only essential personnel to run the forges. And the Elves drift to their more icy winter selves. By July, it seems the world itself is ending. Beggars and starving families line for hours to receive bread from the duke and the nobles. Carts full of emaciated corpses dump their contents into the Divide on a daily basis. The situation is dire enough that King Janus sends the Champion of the Realm, Chadicus to keep the order. Even in the estate, the situation is poor. Goliath mouths require lots of food, even if winter is no obstacle for them. Morozov and Lin spend much of their wealth keeping the tribe fed, leaving the farmers and other misfits with little to live off. 

Then, August comes. The peak of summer arrives with stunning ferocity. Ice melts in a scorching day as the sun bears its full wrath down. Wood houses dry out, making the air unbearably humid. Over a hundred die the first day from dehydration and heat stroke, as the Swellbinders attempt to bring the weather in check but fail. Heat has always been an issue in Daggercourt due to the boiling Divide, but now presents a dire problem. The second day, a fire breaks out and consumes the tinder-dry houses like a dragon devours a goat. Huge swaths of the western city burn to the ground, and the Aurumpuellum suffers hefty damages. The light wards upon it bear traces of having been overwhelmed when an academy mage takes a look. A heftier remnant of Fae energy dances on the ash than anywhere else nearby, making penny a suspect for a while before charges are dropped quietly. 

Most vexing of all is that teleportation seems to reject you. Regardless of who sources the magic, the second you step into a teleportaion circle you are immediately thrown out. Hanneman takes a look at you through a special eyeglass and tells you that normally, the Feywild mirrors the material plane as does the shadowfell. But where you tread, a pool of negative energy pierces through the feywild. It seems that some magic is binding you in place, as if your very souls are tethered to the city. with little to do, you explore the estate. And in each of your individual corners, be it Lucia's small room in the temple where she reads, or Lautrec's prayer room. Small letters in whimsical writing appear on the floor. &quot;M - 2138. T - 431&quot;, and the numbers climb every day. You eventually deduce this is the work of Titania and Mab, the rival queens seemingly making a game of bringing destruction to the city. 

On August the 27th, Mira Daemir of the Academy arrives at the estate, alongside a high-ranking member of the Graves house and a retinue of two-hundred mages of the academy and elven warriors of Silverpine. Chadicus, champion of the realm slams his huge mage against his golden shield to accentuate the point. She clears her voice and enunciates clearly, &quot;Members of the Morozov House. By decree of the Duke, you are guilty of harboring criminals. We have traced a potent Fae curse to this very building and know that it is you who harbors the traitors to the realm. Let them turn themselves in, or we will have no choice but to take them in by force. If you give them up, you can keep your title and your lands, and pay reparations to the duke for all to be forgiven.&quot;

Chadicus steps up, towering easily twelve feet tall and clad in pure Radiant Gold armor engraved with ancient symbols of Celestia. He hefts his bronze mace to his shoulder and slings his tower shield over his back. His voice booms out as he reads from a comically small scroll. &quot;You, traitors, are hereby banished. By the authority of the A-men and King Janus of the Realm, you are to be branded with the mark of traitors. Thad, if you would. A figure in dark plate of the same metal you once saw Leitnaught forged from rises from the earth behind you, wielding a black sword and a hot poker. The metal glows hot and red in the shape of a conical swirl (outline of a poop emoji). 

&quot;If you ever step foot in Arentian lands again, the mark of the traitor will alert the A-men to your presence and we will hunt you down like animals and toss your corpses to the king's hounds. You have brought death and suffering to thousands and no punishment suffered can be enough. So instead, we strive for justice. And know that your sentence isn't easily evaded. The Fraternity of the Light has champions from here to Cardris, and from The Expanse to Durnov. Any kingdom, empire, duchy, or free-state where we operate is off limits to you. So if we were you, we'd start sailing to Ras-Yingral and hope the goblins don't decide to eat you. But to the end of justice, we offer hope. For the price of one million gold, your sentences will be alleviated and your marks removed. That is the price blood demands, and the lesson you should know before bringing so much death and destruction. Tell me, little brothers, was it worth it.&quot;

Mira &quot;We know your curse keeps you from teleportation, so we have taken the liberty of preparing a boat for you. A little dingy that fits five and a halfling, with only a couple leaks. It is yours to sail, though if you make for land as mentioned, you will be hunted. And Thad is itching for an excuse. You have five minutes to gather your things before you are considered in violation of your sentence.&quot;

You board the small boat, a cramped squeeze for all of you and the scorching sun overhead does little to help. six feet a side on the small roofed room, and maybe double that in deck space. The boat rides so low that occasionally, burning hot water spills over the sides and into the boat. It burns but you have to bail it out regardless. As soon as your boat sails off, a line of snow-people form on the dock from the ice that rests on it. They look just like you, except with big Xs for eyes and big sad frowns. They wave as Mira and Chadicus look at them with bewildered eyes. A form of a beatiful arch-fey swirls together from the boiling water. Butterfly wings extend behind her as she lounges on an invisible throne in front of the dinghy. She stares down at you, with an amused expression. Then, suddenly, she blows and boiling water flies forward and burns you all slightly. She disappears and the boat lurches a little, taking on a decent bit of water. Harrowing and cruel laughter echoes. 

By the time the boat leaves daggercourt, the snow seems to have melted and the sun is shining a normal light. 

The first night is terrible. The boiling divide water heats the boat's floor to near unbearable temperature. And not to be outdone, a spirit of Mab appears in the night. Formed of night mist with suspended ice crystals, it dumps frigid ice over the boat and the party before drifting down to the boat's helm. Exhausted and freezing, you see the form of Mab. She strides forth, grasping Lautrec by the throat and pushing him against the boat wall. She pushes her face forward and grins, revealing her razor pointed teeth formed of glittering ice. When she speaks, it echoes with the clarity of a barren winter. &quot;Lautrec...darling...did you miss me. I'm sorry it had to be this way...but the Ancient Laws are what they are. You offended a Fae that was hosting you and now you have to pay the price dear. I didn't expect my darling sister to get involved but she loves one upping me. Really my hand is forced here, dont you see? But don't worry, she isn't watching us at night. Get your rest in dears, I'll be back to torment you in the morning.&quot;

She disappears in a burst of ice, breaking her word almost immediately. The tiny crystals pierce your skin in a thousand places, leaking almost invisibly thin rivers of blood that give your skin a crystalline look. And you are fairly certain she is the one who makes the winds spin the boat in rapid circles in the middle of the night. 
also since youre so hung up on consequences for lucia, i figured the whole party was due for some
sure
yea
mars said duck game
thats a hard pass
even if you did
val omegalul rant
yea wdyw
and i can find 10 minutes some time
nah im done i just need to give the presentation
yea for a little bit
yea wth
?
game
im on
ok well i got 40 minutes to run it down
i grossly underestimated cooking time
im eating but yea. 10 minutes?
or between 1 and 230
im free at 4
yea
20
class in 2
ye
aight
like 4-7
im free after a midterm tmrw
in class rn technically
nig
league
or sit in it and take damage over time
when they leave 
other is a caster that casts a big disruption field and creatures in it make saves
and deals 2 maxhp damage on hit
one big one gives all creatures nearby an extra attack
theres small adds that only attack and reduce your max hp if they hit
yea
yea but they can go below deck until they make the save or smth
its like most of the high CR creatures have a frighten effect
im doing a paper in the back so not really
you can still move just not towards it
frightened 
well you won't be cc'ed you just have to move so the aoe doesnt clap you
so shit like fear or forced repositions disrupt them
the big boss should be the disruptor 
as in they take 3 hits and die
im just using that thing where they essentially have 3 &quot;hit points&quot; 
yea but the adds are already attack sponges
some kind of fear maybe
breath inhale that drags creatures towards it
thats solid
one cool one was it turns the battlefield black and i turn dynamic lighting on 
but i need more ideas
yea those are the 2 i have set and easily telegraphable
idk
i was thinking it slams the ship maybe?
a particularly potent and telegraphed breath that hits the front third
but for now the serpent has a poison rain that targets a third of the ship
i havent raided in fuckin years
or smth
i was thinking theres some ammo under the deck for the catapult that after like 3 hits will make the giant snake retreat
and keeping them off the sun-orb
also i want there to be some objective to do while clearing the adds
its probably a vehicle but even then its better to potentially hit with a major ballista than a fist
so whoever wants to can man it
ok well i figured there should be something to do with the ship
he has like a +5 to hit
ok you dont understand
since jett is anemic as fuck i figure he can go belowdeck and shoot balistas or smth
i made a better map with a more complex ship
you got any cool fight mechanic ideas for that serpent fight
aight back
im gonna grab food rq since i just woke
yea. wanna get the boys for aom or league or smth
lulw same
gonna prep last minute shit at that point so i dont read as much off notes
yea i got until 630
alright
comcast i assume
always fun
also that the serpent's forces will scar you permanently but they should know that cause every time they interact they lose max hp and shit
leading to major stat decreases aka Fading or fully becoming a husk and being trapped in there
no its just someone needs to warn them that the longer they stay and the more they fight with Nilgesh's soldiers, the more worn out their souls will be
yes but theyre already used for bigger things
and he doesnt like direct interaction with the living
since its his realm and theyre technically doing him a favor
hades has forced him to
right but its a 1 minute warning
idk where iago's is so he can jsut narrate
so he can fight
but i actually have a sheet for him
yea ik
to not become a husk
so he can tell the
and restored as more than just a husk
its not catharsis its just exposition. need someone powerful and favored enough by a god to have been pulled out of the void
oh seer
bamduls sister
josephs there
idk the deer guy but derg is there
xd
iago is my favorite parrot
needed a character who theyd know in the underworld
yea i found it
shit me neither

inv
yea im back
I'll be back fifteen
fine. gimme another hour then
so lemme see if thats delayable
but my gf wants to get dinner
well im back right at the 90 minutes
Like 10 minutes out then another 10 to move stuff in and set up
Yea but we are subject to traffic
Worst case 90
Idk how traffic is but roughly an hour
Gimme an hour
Moving my pc now
Can afford to wait for better
Yea but I have money to carry me to August
Who knows. The world is ending
The more the better but
Well. It depends too on travel. Apparently the job is 10% to 50% travel and consulting or installing etc
i dont even think its asking that much
fuck working
im not going to a full time job for under 100
and apply then
but i can just hang out till august
yes
for 110. ok
driving an hour 2 ways for 80k a year is shit
so ig it comes down to money
like everyone seemed impressed by my answers and resume and shit and the culture is cool
idk if i want the job. thousand oaks is hella drive
good i think? will know in 2 weeks but
thanks. ill look in a sec. got done with a day long interview
but if you enlist them then fuck it
told miles id get to carim next tho so i wasnt planning on it
thinking more if they wanna waste a few sessions doing merc work it sounds interesting
its a well reasoned plan
and then the others would essentially be forced to kneel cause she'd have 4 blades and the dagger and even unified theyd only be even
then just create hexblades using the dagger until her island was pacified
shes realistically 3rd in line for the clan head so she'd take out her mom and clan mother
but she thinks she is capable of doing so alone with the knife
if theyre willing she'd hire them as mercenaries
or maybe even go for the heart
or charge right into the voidscar in the ruins of imeset
yea i got it. the way things look theyll either spend next session in a city gathering rumors and intel
cant promise fina wll be their primary god
thats all
but she knows not to overpromise and undermine herself
yea. you can present any argument you want because she cares most about getting that dagger
in incredibly small doses but yea
the common folk are more shinto. objects have spirits and ancestors are powerful type shit
yea. the nobles are bonded with various infernal masters
religious change would be hard on her people and would weaken her position as empress so she'd be careful to not promise too large
she personally is the champion of one of their demons and her people are used to the worship of nature spirits and some of the fiends
lautrec is the tricky one
idk about jett
convincing him itll improve the world is enough
the psychic is fundamentally a good person
feels less forced if its you than me too
yea. thatd be in character. just convince them that youll help
but with ambition and self-centeredness thinking only she can do so. and disliking other nobles for being of lesser talents or birth which is ironic
i pictured her as more soft and caring towards the common folk and wanting to break the endless war for them
i think her sheet traits make her too harsh
moving my stuff to sm tomorrow
nah im on laptop
im back. i think most of it is on her character sheet
hold on ill be back in a bit
cares a lot about appearances and etiquette
she likes to talk to her sword, moonsliver, just to reassure it that the battle is over and it can rest
you know. edelgard 
unless the situation was truly hopeless in which case she'd make sure at least one person was behind
but she'd want to push forward through danger rather than retreat
yea. she cares about her self-preservation over any of the others because she knows she has a destiny  to fulfill as empress
yea. ill type up some personality stuff then next week her shorter term goals
theres also an arentian redemption pally i cut but shes fleshed out
hakone noblewoman aka edelgard lol
its rei hayasaki
her page is in PCs-&gt;allies
aight. lemme get dinner and ill tell you about her
i got the future weeks all free xd
doesnt have to be this week. my spring break trip got fucked so
can save the other character for next campaign then
if you want mars is playing the npc rn. i can give you her page and tell you about her if you wanna run her one session
otherwise back
you can put it wherever. if you want them to know put it on the front
and a lot of time
personally im leaning on 3d6 but theres a lot of other shit to iron out
nah i was seeing how it would go
also the subreddit is r/3d6
then do custom
yea but we always did roll in chat
probably do a real stats thing closer to the start
try 3d6 i wanna see hwo it goes
idk yet. we never really settled on it
it works yea
thats how you launch the level ups too
and launch it from there
you can go to the gear page
aight. did you use the character mancer
aight
game?
yes
i just want to make them get shot by auto cannons
and theres a golem and shit
or the other side is littered with drow corpses and illusioned to look like the entrance
then theres either the big temple with more drow hanging in front and a powerful evil presence
ok fuck it. the gate thing happens. the drow-disguised guards tell you to fuck off and come back at night, try to kill you if you do
too many combats is just fucking boring tho
true. im figuring it out
or if harmonic copper can be synthesized into truly sentient creatures or only automatons
studying how to best determine if opals grow differently under different moon phases
you know. 17th level wizard holed up in a mountain with her 20 simulacrums and 40 clockwork dragons
its the shit you hate but everyone else is chillin with
ngl its just this crazy op and just generally crazy wizard bitch
who just reads a map title to decide where to go
bc fuck them for coming here
rapid fire mode for people open. barrage mode to shatter rocks
that just barrage the shit out of you
and 3 legit fucking gatling guns
the way its set up is lots of rocks
not 100% yet. i just know a clockwork golem sounds hilarious
otherwise you can just fuck off
but alll the people got forced out cause of the automatons and if they wanna get to her they go fight the golem to enter
anyway shes just this crazy wizard building clockwork automatons with the harmonic copper dug from the valley
she named herself after the valley xd
e.g. the valley of riches
well the meme is the gnome is now mihara riches
fuck the elementals its just straight up call of duty now
clockwork golem with auto turrets
aight wdyt of this fight
aight we're game
aight. im waiting for milo to get back from the beach
game
tm
soon
so league
im gonna get on as soon as i fill a maintainence request
ok well milos on league &quot;soon&quot;

league
its ccoolmage
aight im good
give me like 30 minutes. i gotta finish my own thing
thats what it is
no stfu. M A T H B I T C H
its simple math
there should be at least 50+ 17+ characters in 40k
when statistics are with me
no im bothering you cause you got salty at me that there was a level 20 npc
math literally says if you have 20k people, 1 being 20 isnt much of an outlier, much less with 40k people
bitch
math
btw
ok boomer
lol ok. i thought there was no fucking way youd actually just play
did you pop on league for like 2 milliseconds
20
Yea I didn't have time to fill anything out tho
Yea I didn't have time to fill anything out tho
Yea that's fine
so if im not there start w/o me and ill join up or miss it. whichever is smoother for you

i just feel like this is super racist
and change it
we can come back to that
idc about the name
from native american
are almost indistinguishable
aboriginal taiwanese/japenese
tibetans and inuits still have a very similar culture
i just want to see what youre trying to say
not even related to the game rn
are literally the core of buddhist beliefs
shamanism and animism
is from asia
you do know that the basis of native american culture
ok wait are you fucking with me rn
the closest genetic comparison to inuits is asian
to the americas
yes they moved from asia
inuits...are asian
also i cant exactly look up ethnicities
ik im just saying you underestimate what theyre chilling with
milo told us about agile like monkey last night
im not sure any of them are against that
xd
inn-uck-suck
anne-gee-j
nick-lick
i just read the letters
lmao you think i can

shes a drunk that nikliq hates
idk her mom can be inuksuk
sister anjij
sgt. matthews
so she's a trained fighter moreso than a ranger
in exchange for training
she'd just bring an extra rabbit or two
to sell shit
yea thats the whole reason shes there
would practice with people
the character hunted but during visits to town
squadW
cmon
no wtf shes a woman
to be better at defending against the wild creatures
and got trained by some of the local guards
fine then she went to the town
i mean theres people nearby
cabin
thats why its a perfect ruse
nobody expects the woman to defend the town
all nikliq knows is skirmishing with other tribes and hunting
sister's job
works
otherwise tundra or something else cold
arctic if its close
that isnt a historical photo
i cant find a male picture
actually hes a she
but has to leave to make money
hes probably close with his sister
ngl i just want to play a typical inuit guy
as his mother also took to the white man's drink
he was raised by an older sister
nah his father was an alcoholic who left for the big city
and as close as i can get without having source material stuff
thats pretty close to what i was thinking
sure
now i gotta think of what a french child would fight
inuits hadnt invented bows
i was going to say hunting large animals with a polearm
theyre basically natives
fine ill be french then
aight thats fine
its what you club the seals with
im polearm guy
thats fine unless hes polearm guy
it can be a jungle or some shit i cant really look up source material rn
you can honestly come up with the town and parents and their connection or like any village really
named nikliq
i was gonna make a human fighter from some inuit type village 
im keeping it quiet
no like were trying to watch a movie
just type
cant talk rn
90%
yea i think so
what time are you thinking
like setting wise
play i guess. whatre you running
hey so christina might be busy tonight. if she is you mind if i join you guys
so ill try to move that around
ill try to make it. rn though christina and i were gonna go do smth
but were gonna move the time back to 9 anyway
not sure yet we still have a lot of stuff to talk about with them
but yea were cool
in why i came back around so soon
like the changes are a big thing
there was more stuff than you
and see if its something you wanna do
were still cool so when you feel ready you can join us for a session as a recurring pc or smth and see how weve changed it up
to how we run and approach the game
for now we think its best you take a break so others arent overshadowed and we want to try implementing some new changes
also i dont want to make a new campaign bc pretty much everyone wants to stay as is
aight listen. first i never blocked you i just didnt know what to say
talk to each other
maybe instead of talking to me
ez
i just match the tone now
nah fuck it you guys tell each other what you want to run with
i wasnt going to but it gets brought up anyway
i cant fix shit by talking to them and nobody talks to each other
so i can just run standard monsters and chill
so i dont need to care either. everyone but mars has shit stats and cant meta
but the second it comes up it doesnt matter
aight. also i already told them to make serious shit and they always say theyll try to be good 
ez
and not think about it
gonna go to the gym and clean shit up for her to come back
idc rn. im gonna chill with christina and my family for a few weekends and see if i ever want to come back
idfk rn
everyone made dumbass meme characters
we got a reset and session is weeks away
campaign is bothering me. i miss christina and this is all i had to do all weekend
so idk
this is like shit i dont have to deal with for a long time right
tbh im just tired
they will if you bring it up
you played 1 session
and you specifically made a character all the nobles should be disgusted wittth
i guess. idk how you wanted me to work that in considering you guys were government despising anarchists
it be like that thot
lautrecs was easy to work in and jetts was the story. milos wasnt so we only scratched it
idfk just tell me what it is
if you make an empire character that actively ignores the ambassador and her shit then probably not
depends how tied in it is to the stuff in the game
same as usual
thats it man
just be part of the party
i play league in low diamond im pretty used to it
plus its easier once you cant meta
thats half the fun
kinda. but i like flaming so
but ur toxic
everyone elses
fuck you im not reading it
Actually Lucia is better than average only because it takes all 3 slots instead of 2
If he thinks it's weak I can switch it or smth. Or you guys give him the next good one since everyone's at their one greater rune
The only one strictly better than the others is maybe jett but it hasa huge cost and he's already weaker than everyone else anyway
You're tripping. His is the most clutch
If he wants a different one he can cut it off another person
Like Lucia fails intervention or he fails concordance but suddenly a god intervenes anyway 
You're insane if you don't. It's literally the ability to rig any check or roll
Like if Lucia really needs intervention
And miles can gift it
Jett is on any d20
Follower
Loot 
Concordance
It's any roll
? Yours is fine
You're just overly paranoid
More importantly the assassin has a metallic rune. None from outside the city are of the right blood lines
Idk why you bring up the wife but she arrived a year or two before Xavier died
Nobody would risk working with the assassin. One missed step would mean execution
The events don't line up
Also if you're accusing him of working with the assassin his dad was just killed
Except the Duke
Every assassination has been someone who oppressed commoners
At the execution the assassin mentioned they stood with commoners. Of course they'd leave eliot and kill the father
His father might but his father is dead
Most importantly tho that's not who eliot is. He cares for the city and always stood with the Duke. Even when the city was under siege he fought for it. He'd never endanger the people like that
i gotta go to class
tbc
not to mention the church
but even with 10000 they couldnt take on the guard when the elves and Emerald Hand stand with them
yea you do
hresvelg has likely around 2500 soldiers
aight
they probably want to source cheap weapons to sell at high prices to pay off this debt
the riegans owe so much that the hresvelgs are calling on them to repay but cant
riegan and hresvelg are strained
man you haven't heard news in a while
see but 1000 men isnt enough to stage a coup, the guard alone has more than that
they even kept contracts with ironflex smiths to forge the arms and armor
assumedly the same as always, arming more house guards to protect their investments. they had issues with kobolds in their mines so they likely want to exterminate them
they know. he backed out of a deal with the dwarves for the ore
yea what do you have worth telling them
but they keep the right to refuse any deal you make in their name obviously
yes, you can negotiate vague terms but not sign anything. 
you can have a letter of approval saying that youre one of their good-faith operators. but you arent approved to make deals or bargains on their house's behalf
so many houses are reliant on their good grace
and the hresvelgs employ a pretty big chunk of the dock workers
chad is extremely popular with commoners so the houses voting for him look better
really the big weaknesses to his position are that hes a dwarf
he believes his message. it is his job after all
hes a busy man. fights to fight and people to persuade
again this is one of his advisers but sure
and people are paying huge sums to be taken downriver in ships only the hresvelgs have
because the hresvelgs have an interest in keeping the elves around. theyve always been close with Silverpine and their business has only been getting better since the riots started because so many people are shipping things to be sold higher price downriver
and yes it suffers because of the damn elves. with him as lord marshal theyd be able to finally remove them
they have a vested interest in keeping it stable and running
of course he does its literally the family's source of wealth and power
dwarves are logical and strictly follow their laws and codes unlike elves who twist words and meanings
elves are whimsical and prone to bouts of madness
because dwarves at least care about lives and don't see humans as inferior
and they have the arms and material to equip them
the ironflex's are better than the hresvelgs for the city because theyll send the elves home. their oath is to the lord marshal and the hresvelgs don't have the men to refuse their aid. the ironflexs however, can call on the aid of Black Mountain and General aranik to provide soldiers who can keep the peace
guard captain and famous gladiator
yea thats him
everyone rushes out to ambush him
my understanding of the plan was they kill him
your whole plan
wasnt that
i literally thought you wanted to do the ambush
giron is the one running
anyway you can just talk rn. session i want to just run the teams. also theres handouts for the 3 sons
by session he'll be like 3/4th the way there
the city is 200
not even
i thought you guys were waiting on the road for him
i thought you were with the ambushing joe team
not with him personally but at least with a house attendant
fair enough. if you offered up good information that they didn't have previously theyll grant an audience
you do have that motive tho right
most officers are nobles
also like a good fifth of them
like 60% or more. most are academy trained
also what proof is there his house position is unstable. the instability isn't going away and months have gone by where their armaments keep the guard and the peace
even if you arent a spy what can you possibly offer that practiced nobles can't though
also his position isnt even that bad. rn the city is depending on his house to produce the weapons and armor they need 
4 votes down. also you could be a spy trying to infiltrate and sabotage, you are human after all. or you could be trying to manipulate him for personal gain. really theres little to trust you on when you just say &quot;trust me&quot;
why does he have the incentive to meet with a human he doesnt know
i mean what do you have to offer him that his advisers and house allies don't
go find it wtf
earlier
its in gestalt timeshare 
itll take time or gold to replace them, usually time because a smith's tools are usually very specialized and private
he has the skill of a 5th but no tools
base price is 55gp. 3rd level smith produces 50gp/work a day with his apprentices. so ~5 days provided with the materials
oh yea sure
doing what
yea true. anyway the paladin is Brother Velain, Ancients Paladin of Vixendel. Half-elf, 29, with the Lesser Rune of the Wanderer
they <b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">were</b> loyal to the city until their lord left
and theres a village of the ex prisoners
where only 1 lord lives
you let them follow you almost out of the city
you were followed for like 90% of the trip home
aight. they head eastward to find employment under a new lord
which is significantly less than his retainer as a knight
120gp for armor, mounts, weapons, etc
theres 8 of them and they cost 140gp to upkeep/pay
so they went to you because you are somewhat his successor
they know you spoke with glorfindel and convinced him to abandon the city. they cant return to silverpine while the others stay by the oath to serve the city but they wont follow it either
thats mb
i meant to say he was requesting lucia
theyre both seeking you in particular as an officer but you can run it by them. mechanically its either a 5th level paladin or a unit of veteran medium archers
so if you remember i said i would roll the followers chart for last session and it high rolled an ally. but you wanted units. so the situation is a paladin of the church heard about the false imprisonment and decided to follow Lucia as head of her offshoot church. But a squad of elves also arrived after hearing glorfindel left and they refused to follow any new captain. Instead, they want to join and serve you as you are his somewhat-successor. the two parties will not cooperate though so you can pick if either stays
a weekday afternoon between lunch and dinner shows
news
prime time or daytime new
yea you get a showtime
yes money is the key
and various townsfolks that had their shops and houses destroyed
remember these were fina's faithful
untrained and mostly unfit
you could but theyre unarmed and unarmored
then youd have soldiers to actually be an officer for and a sergeant to command them
theyre not soldiers at all. theyre just various craftsmen and farmers. although if you want to recruit some actual soldiers i can roll the followers chart for only soldiers this time and exclude allies
Yea. also, since everyone else had a vision with their rune, adrian's was:
the ancient words of &quot;Sight&quot; and &quot;Beyond&quot; form this crimson rune, He watched through this eye as the cosmos spun, seeing all that was, is, and would be. The sight knew and understood all things, but it was beyond mortal understanding. Then, from beyond existence came a horror that the sight could not understand. It had no goal but consumed and destroyed all the same. The sight lost track of what would come to pass as this new horror carved up the divine plan. a new eye appeared, splintered from the original. It was born of the horror and bestowed upon it sight of the future. None who can see through this new eye can be trusted, for they bear the Serpent's corruption.
Greater Rune of the Tactician - This rune acts as your third eye. As an action, you can send it up to 200ft away from you where it hovers, glowing bright crimson light, until you recall it as a bonus action. The rune can only be up to 1000ft from you. If the rune is damaged, it returns immediately, dealing double the damage taken to you as psychic damage. At any time, you can glimpse through the rune, causing it to flare in brightness. Melee attacks against you have advantage for 1 round after you do so. Finally, once per long rest, you can flare the rune to give it truesight for 30 seconds. After doing so the rune is unusable until you complete a long rest and you take 1/4th your max hp in unrecoverable damage until completing the long rest. Innate: Your third eye empowers your understanding. You have +5 to perception and insight, so long as you can see the target.
ill get back after thats done
aight. im gonna post miles rune then finish a paper
it really seems like something you would look up tbh
i figured soldiers threw horseshoes and shit
i thought that would be too intellectual for them
really?
is this character also a theater person
aight
or want a more random one like despair/swift
y/n
and thats also part of why he was promoted
maybe a rune of the tactician
morozov stays back and hurls spells
big crits
lautrec goes for big rolls
penny for instance likes drawn out brawls
like whats their preference
i guess a better question is how do they handle themselves in battle 
like lautrec is strangely lucky, almost fated
them
or something that seems uncanny about the
i guess
yea
or like endurance
or despair
determination maybe
anything exeptional
are they extremely loyal or drawn to violence
ok what about the character's personality
or lucias connection with gemi
like lautrec seems weirdly fated
or anything theyre particularly drawn to
is there anything special about this character's parentage
especially as a ranking officer
i guess if you want a magic item for this character it makes sense for his rune to have been awakened during military service
so thats an outlier and not a norm
afaik everyones chillin rn. so far youre the only one flaming me
like its not too bad everyones kinda together
cause ik jett and miles are out after
nah im gonna finish this one then reset
it wouldnt matter
i mean i know you people
rn everyone is chasing their own thing and so its hard to tie it all together
tbh the big thing is i just wish everyone had a more unified goal
rn i like where campaign is so idc much
just taking notes for improvements rn
i dont think that far ahead
me neither
i kinda figured you and mars are the likely ones to stay with milo next. miles and jett unlikely
if theyre with it the heretics will be more prevalent and strong
if theyre against the church itll be stronger and more of an antagonist
like the personalities of each house and whos an ally/enemy
and try it again with some changes
then randoms until theres 6
i was gonna take anyone from this one willing to stick around
im gonna make it so everyone must be with or against the church
tbh i think when this is over and i do this again
theyll be fine with it
if you tell them this one is sticking around
they didnt hate the character i think they just hated that he went in seemingly for no reason on a hopeless fight
Chaos court. Church. Or no religion. Or just the lone worshipper of a forgotten god 
Chaos court. Church. Or no religion. Or just the lone worshipper of a forgotten god 
so did you come to a decision
it just doesnt make sense that someone who attacked his homeland still follows their beliefs
aight. if you go areligious you can start with some standing in the academy or smth
and rolling their shit
cause if so youre moving the tokens
are you dead set on necromancy
wizards dont get power from gods and if he really did try to acclimate he wouldve needed to join the church
you could also just be areligious
like they just send ghosts/wights
though no new court
order is wack in that book. its literally anti-magic because magic is chaos. page 31 has a list of servitors for a god of undeath to send
and mars is with nobody afaik
jett is with the nine hells
and even then in opposing celestials
order is the inexorables theyre both in the celestials
nobody is in order
or make one up
lemme think
idk which court
i like the backstory. interesting last name tho lol
ill see you in 30
im gonna take a nap rq
aight
send me the backstory and shit
aight go for it then
cause they grow and you get used to tthem and the party dynamic
anyway if you want to switch then do it but long term characters are more fun
ofc theres barely anyone handing out magic items
ALSO theres literally an academy class to study enchanting and down time to make a magic item or find a seller or smth
and even then they only appear in descendants 1/16th of the time
only metallic runes are given by the saints
yes
the others are innate in the blood of mortals
theres only 8 specific ones tied into them
the runes arent even from saints
besides those theres only like the 2 beads and cloaks
the main magic items in this game are your runes
also literally at any time you couldve gotten your rune awakened
then swapped noxalas
you had the bead of elemental glass
but ik milo likes keeping characters start to finish
like i think you should switch if you want
and a new rune
idk its hard for me too when characters switch cause then theres a new backstory to work in
He likes characters that stay cause you get used to them abd their personality
You misunderstood why Milos saltt
Idk why you're done with it otherwise tho
I'm ok with that
But like idk 
I mean inting is lame
Ik
after interviews
was gonna do it like wednesday
havent handled anything rn
yea im just busy
although at minimum it takes 2 weeks to recharge
idk smth like &lt;10 -&gt; 1/2 speed, 10-20-&gt;normal, 20-40-&gt;1.25x, 40-100-&gt;1.5x, 100-200-&gt;2x, then i guess +.25x every 100
it is
one man had his children taken by the guard and he never returned
their houses burned, they lost loved ones in the riots
though the new ones are not so large as the first
the grove begins to take hold between the 3 trees
then, somehow, a man overhears you and offers himself as well
ok so you follow someone down on his luck and eventually talk him into accepting change and the miracle claims him as he did the tabaxi
no
you can do stealth + persuasion but with no advantage instead of one or the other with it
stealth and religion
persuasion to get people to volunteer and religion
the larger the faster the power returns
but itll still function as a grove
well itll be a small grove so the power will take longer to recharge
if you choose reincarnate the target will be a random race
they become stone
...yes
the petrified corpse of the tabaxi
you have one
but even then the land is hallowed and bound to lucia
or going through and removing all the artifacts and the shrines and the altars and replacing them i guess
the only alternative to unhallowing the church is for lucia to die and a cleric of a different faith to claim the land
A variant temple, the druidâ€™s grove4

gives up the bonus
to concordance for owning a temple in exchange for
installing a powerful spell, including spells you donâ€™t
know or which might not be on the druid spell list, into
the grove making it permanent.
The druid chooses one spell from the list below
and spends a month in meditation. If the powers that
grant them their spells are pleased with their work,
they permanently install the spell the druid requested,
which can be cast once per period listed in the Grove
Spells table.
you cant really unhallow the church alone. youd have to stop them from completing their rituals and installing their altars
you can see how a druid grove works
if you go to page 32
for you to construct a temple of your own would be more like a druid constructing a grove
the main sanctity of a holy place comes from the &quot;ownership&quot; of it by a powerful cleric. The spiritual bond between lucia and the place through it being appointed upon her in addition to the church literally casting hallow and other similar rituals. youd be able to take over the basement floor flooded with effigies but not the church as a whole
2 months
the church?
yes, they still have installations to put down there
its teeming with workers and church staff
the whole place is still under construction
but if you did youd know its got like 3 underground floors
you havent gone into it yet
you were in the sewers and so youd know the cathedral goes DEEP under the city
yes, holy ground gives benefits to the faithful
Tongues out obviously. Nobody wants to hear that heresy
Yea. You also learn tho they plan on taking the prisoners to the silver bridge to be hung from cages
its protection of the followers too
the mythal is more than protection of the objects
also detect magic shows that the church itself blesses the faithful within
yea theyre enchanted statues
your intuition tells you theyre not just for show
the stairwell down is smooth marble and torchlit, 88 stairs down with 4 statues on both sides
you do spot a bishop going below ground so you know where the door is
anything above ground is just like the citadel. avoidable with good illusions and dispells
just usual arcane warding
above ground the church is a lot less defended
a mythal is a persistent magical field that changes how reality works over a large area. Creating the most powerful of mythals requires many wizards of great renown and long experience to engage in the same ritual, while lesser wizards feed spells into the growing webwork of magic. Such a ritual can take a long time to perform and sometimes requires the sacrifice of lives in order to achieve its purpose, but the results can be utterly miraculous.
its like a divine mythal
A mythal can't be dispelled or suppressed by any conventional means, nor can its effects. Once one is in place, it seemingly lasts forever, since none are known to have dissipated. A mythal's nature can only be warped or changed, and that can be accomplished only through the use of magical energy equal to that required for its creation. 
its a modified version of something from mordenkainens one sec
its not that easy to get in
and the artifacts of the church
its the catacombs of saints
its still going to burn you away all the same
you remember lights hope chapel. its that kind of consecration. the burn away at your flesh kind
the thieves guild runs under the city, part of it intersecting with the undergrounds of the grand cathedral but the stones are consecrated as fuck. beyond arcane defenses something divine is protecting the contents of the vaults
No. My idea for him has him capable of sending lesser members to aid
a force of change that punishes those with ill intent, particularly those in power. it is regarded as a once-king of the court of chaos, now perhaps a powerful but retired duke
nah i have an idea
like you want me to come up with it or you have a plan yourself
is your characters goal to discover what the miracle is
a goal is nice
yea sure. i thought thats what was happening anyway
aight sure
thought you were mars
oh i saw the picture
did you have the petty doing something week 2
aight
well ask them then
noxalas did pretty well outsides though
nah i think its fine
like noxalas comes on when its something non psychotic
or are you planning on splitting
are you using iago as a full time replacement
aight
â€¢	Bone Fungus
o	Underdark/Caves
o	Bulbous ivory-colored fungus that releases a 10 ft cloud of spores, in the presence of motion, that work as an inhaled poison (DC Constitution 15, 1d8-1 poison damage). If damage is taken, bone density is reduced, resulting in extra damage from bludgeoning in the form of an extra space for criticals against you (19 or 20 counts as a crit). The fungi are immune to acid and thunder, destroyed by cold or radiant damage, fire and electricity also destroy but release spores
?
ok
did he bring some underdark flowers or other exotic plants with him
alright 
otherwise the characters business would be unrelated
idk. the only one that really makes sense is you hung at the greenhouse or smth waiting for them to arrive
just the servitor sent on a success varies by court and god
technically for anyone you can use an action to plea for divine intervention
yea the concordances
well...then yes they wont like a heretic
do you accept their saints
your choice
nah idc
thats fine
yea sure
with change and flesh to bark
ngl the miracle sounds more like a druidic deity
one sec
im trying to do a coding thing
i was gonna ask how he gets around the city as a drow
just lmk
or aspiring to become the white king
like a baron whos a deposed king
but yea sure. as long as it ties into the court somehow
thats already all the court of all flesh
do you have a different deity in mind
so you do have the pdf yea
yea on page 160 ish
i was talking about at the start of the campaign
the strongholds and followers pdf
do you have the pdf
court of the all flesh?
theater dude with a different instrument
yea make one or it can be the same as noxalas
lautrec is basically hired muscle but even he is following fina
penny does her thing and lucia obeys the church more than jett
idk if thats really true
for the first time i have a lot of backstory from everyone
yea
nah thats hype
are you rerolling stats
so they know
aight. you can tell the party ooc first
ok ill make the sheet rq
But if itâ€™s ooc obviously donâ€™t do it
Idk. What do you want to do. I also donâ€™t want a split party
Yea idk. I think if not outright cruel theyâ€™re ambitious 
About murder being ooc
Itâ€™s up to you. If you want it to be a surprise donâ€™t show me and I wonâ€™t look
So leaves an inbetween time
The play thing I thought was a week then schedule for week of session
No
Actually he probably does too 
Or penny's assassination
Like lautrecs prison break
Yea but that's part of it. I like that they find wack missions to do
Yea. UA is all cool. Idk people are sticking with it tho so I want to keep going
Maybe they weren't perfect though
Sure you can be skeptical but all accounts say the saints saved the world
You only know history after the calamity
Not canon 
More likely to find a patron to sponsor shows. Bigger crowds. More fame among nobles
And a little poison
Kill them with the awe
For a killer show
Top 100 already and becoming famous
After the 30 performance you jumped pretty high in the ranks tho
Gamer
Trying to rise up
For week 2 yes. Unless you skimp rehearsal and try to pass those exams
Yea. 430
Aight. Prime time spot again
So depends how good a spot you want
Well your first performance nets 530gp in tips. No offer of patronage. 
Yea
It's like what. 10
9+mod
Nvm Google has a dice
Ok. I'll roll it when I'm on pc
Ok. I'll roll it when I'm on pc
Do you want to do the show week 2 then have another one during session
But for the academy the novice apprentice and adept tiers need a fee and passed assessments and get you almost all services except saving throw training
You have one. I was gonna say its 7pm the day of session
Otherwise. A bribe
The handout for the academy services lists the requirements
But not as an outsider
Like maybe as an apprentice you could weasel into one of his adept classes
You'd have to achieve the required status to get into classes
Instead of 30-35
He's only 24-25
Likely exceeds. He's considered talented. Usually people don't attempt the thesis until they're extremely learned
arright so you learn that miren is a member of the academy and currently in courses. hes studying to complete his arcane thesis and his courses are mostly in the adept-expert level
yea
yea ik
once everyone says what they do
which is why i said ill update everyone on how it goes
like if someone sets fire to his house he wont be in class
so nothing anyone does affects it
yea but i want to see what everyone does
sure. you can ask around and try to find what class he's in
the ranks arent strictly tied to actual magic skill
its a status symbol
most nobles are at least a novice
possibly academy
be magic
yea you were there you saw him
etc
going to the academy
plus theres personal things like crafting items or portions
sure but when everyone has their individual incomes to spend its on everyone to recruit or obtain what they think is best
sure but even if thats all noxalas wants to do theres house business to tend to. like acquiring lands and staff
academy classes, meet people, make deals, etc
and update shit
2-3 time between sessions ill gather what everyone says they did in the down time
yea
true. i think itd be cooler if the fire spirit just beat on people passively tho
the fire animal comes from you
instead of becoming the fire animal
but better
nah its like what i wanted the fire druids to be
i always knew fire druids are the best druids
i like this circle
thats pretty sick
well TIL temp hp doesnt stack
im interested
nah link it
good point
yea thats better
i like that you actually take time to write what to perform tho
mars' could be working in the dark, a flash of steel and wild grin, the blade of the guild
but i think jetts is the best
i like all of them tbh
otherwise its good
the last part of mars'
yea
thanks
are you cool if i maybe run campaign again this week. for some reason im still really in the mood and school hasnt fully kicked in yet so i have the time for like a week or two
yea. you called him daniel right
ok
btw did you have miles disguised when he pretended to be an inspector
might have been me tho
so we said 7
idk i thought someone was busy
7
Here 
I'm on the way
Yea
Anything
6
hmm ok
wby
and mars wants to rob someone for money and buy an establishment to make money
rn milo is on either treasure hunting or helping peasants to get them to join
also im asking everyone what they want to do first is
so typing is overall easier
and i lag a bunch
also my connection sucks
yea cause i was eating
you did never call me tho
you can make up anybody and ill see if its too far out
i guess. still maybe come up with a few associates then
so what are you just true neutral
what about rival performers then
any particular friends or enemies
young lesser nobles that go to the theater and shit
ok so he knows some patrons then
or maybe he was a dock scribe or smth
anyway. other ties? theres multiple theaters and an arena where he could have played
pog
oh it worked
nothing is ending. great
also i think my skype died
like an ex-patron or was he trained at the academy or what
ok. does he have any other connections to people in the city
so why did he join up
ok. remember youre working either for or with jetts nobleman
eating
type
whats yours
sure
ah. nah im working on campaign rn
yea why
in my dorm
and melee weapons can be used to counterattack anyone that attacks you with anything
bows can counterattack other bows and spells
spells can only counterattack other spells
they obv have to be in range
i think for now the rules are its a reaction but can be done up to multiattack times
and when you counterattack with a spell you can only use a cantrip
shield is still better unless youre specifically being attacked with a targeted spell
except against other spells
no cause you can't counterattack with spells
you can counterattack one more attack
but for every multiattack extra hit you have
yes
Depends if Milo can transfer
safe assumption
yea i think it should work
unless someone else wants to 
yea
And Milo is ok being the noble so the house can have a little legitimacy and start the â€œyour own houseâ€ thing immediately
This is what I wrote while super tired last night but itâ€™s what I think the intro should be
The Duchy of Thaeron under the late duke Xavier Graves was known as the heart of the Etrudian Kingdom. Centered along the violent waters of the Divide, the capital city of Daggercourt commanded the Silvermoon Harbor, first and largest of the suitable ports along the river. To its north, the Silverpine forest provides fine lumber to build the sturdy ships able to sail the Divide; and to the west, the Emerald Vale provides a bounty of food and ore to feed the city. Within the capital the thrum of industry transforms beats the raw materials into all manner of goods that are then shipped down the Divide. Thaeron, and especially Daggercourt, grew wealthy and powerful from these shipments.In the good times of old, the city ran with practiced efficiency. Xavier Graves tolerated no corruption under his rule and the dockmasters saw the construction of over a dozen ships every week, for none can ever make the return journey up the Divide. The noble houses were kept in check through heavy taxation and strict oversight while the commoners were appeased with government services and the opportunity to raise themselves up. Now, the marble city dangles on the edge of collapse. Killed in the night by a nail, the throne of Thaeron passed to the young Maxwell Graves. A boy of thirteen, Maxwell thinks only of vengeance and bows to the whim of his High Council in all other matters. Greed and corruption have clogged the gears of trade as more and more coin flows into the hands of noble houses. In the night, when mists from the boiling river blanket the city, a shadow war rages between houses. Though the vying for each otherâ€™s territory and wealth is nothing new between noble houses, a new development has surfaced. Through a dangerous and painful process, the Swellbinders channel the raw power of the Divide into an individual to awaken the Rune hidden within them. Using their Runes, noblemen now live double lives between day and night. Son, I find myself caught in this struggle and Iâ€™ve seen shadows in the mists at night. I know that the nature of my Rune has been leaked and they will soon come for me. You are the last hope of this house and I hope that you will come home soon to assume my position. I regret that our finances are in ruin and our artisans moved to House Lonato but I have left you our estate and the names of our old suppliers and allies. Return home, son, restore our house. But be careful who you trust with the secret of your house for there are those who will use you for your rune. 
And nah Christina isnâ€™t into kebab
Iâ€™m here
Iâ€™m on the way
Aight
You have any recommendations for good pasta
530?
i can pick you up
ik they are lol. we go to dinner with other people its not like its our date or anything
Dinner 5 or 6
You ask I gotta grab a ride rq
Understandable. Christina wants to grab pasta for dinner so you wanna do that
Second look at numbers and shit
Also I want to talk about the home brew rules Milo and I made
Nothing really. Iâ€™m with Christina so we were gonna rest a little bit Iâ€™m down to hang like 3-4
At the airport
Like an hour
can you upload this and make it my picture
battlemaps are 50/50. i had a huge drive folder of them
and fucking dungeons
its like towns and the world maps
the static pictures for caves or forest when i was describing stuff was easy
especially cause art stuff takes me ages
milo and i thought its better anyway
well i was only going to do it every 2 weeks
i liked the map
i was mostly asking cause idk if i want to do campaign again. it was a lot of work but it was fun and rn im like 50-50 on continuing milos
like all the maps for milos too
cause i put a lot of art on there
i used to have it upgraded to run campaign
yea the r20 account
cause otherwise i was gonna take over milos
aight. if you are i wasnt gonna upgrade again
so are you planning on running your campaign during the school year or just this once
rn
lets go
fuck it should
wait fuck i missed ror cause i was at a dinner
Game is lit 
Weird but ok. Play risk of rain with us sometime when you can
That's rough 
Yea but of all the places McDonald's
Wtf why
I can't type that with a straight face
banging some haram pussy
where you at fucking midnight on a wednesday
you wanna play risk of rain
i forgot how long painting takes
same
I sketched evandar. What do you think. Still need to paint
him
where liu bei never talked to zhang fei about it and eventually his drinking killed hi
he actually addressed xu chu and his drinking and made him a better man
tbh tho this is what changed my mind about him
100 vs 100000+ easy math
even cao cao thought guan yu was worth 100000 troops and still that he wasnt lu bu's match
hes still worth 900 more
even if you need to put 100 men to watch and guard him at all time
its easy math
instead of hiring the man
his only fuck up is executing lu bu
yea ik
cao cao is the second best leader you were right
that actually changed my mind
and a shit ton of good clips of him
also  theres a 2010 3k show with a really good cao cao actor
tbf tho i was using sun ce and not lu bu
my vanguard kill record is only 2k
yea im bad
and generally high level legendary vanguards average 4-500
ive seen a really well played lu bu take out 4k in a single battle
they also really undervalue heroes
ik. at least its fun riding them down with cav that cost more than their whole army
except to the auto delegate calculator
like theres no way 4k peasants vs 2.2k imperial glaives, heavy cav, and dragon archers with 2 treb is a decisive loss for me
even though your troops are all elite
cause they outnumber you
wont let you delegate them
listen buddy im not afraid its just the ai
piece of shit guy
runs around with 12 full stacks of peasants warriors on the map at all times
in 2 turns
this man goes from vassal to ambushing your son
also liu bei is a bitch
i got fog of warred
then the other 2 pop out of ambush on their turn and go in for the 3v2
1 weak one that baited me forward in march
2 ambush armies set up beforehand
also the fucking ai is genius now
actually i blame the mod person but yea
xd
dynasty warriors sprites
yea but like
idk how using dynasty warriors art makes it crash
ive crashed 3 times since i installed it
its the fucking anime mod
you know what it is
and then afterwards the game crashes before you can save
tfw you fight a 40 minute battle outnumbered 3 full stacks to 2
yikes
or smth else
league
Aight 
I'm not sure how to check
So I'd rather ask him
So I'd rather ask him
But online says replace all but it's also the internet
It's just one tire leaking
Yea ik I'm going in tomorrow
Or should I do the front set or all 4
Yo can you ask your dad if it's ok to replace just one tire on a car. I think it's 4wd but I'm not sure
besides the names
i think this is gonna be the finished version
from the generator
no just random ones
how do you feel about this
Ay were here
Ay were here
Yea 1145
did you get 3k
we'll hang out another day yea
my parents brought food back
milos on
league
i dontsee you
?
you wanna get on
nah finished
of ranked
i was in a game
talk
and tlak
league
yea probably lol
so there
anyway i think you said you needed it for your own thing
idk if milo relabeled it
the map
did you see the final version
i was gonna ask if i can crash your couch or smth next week
damb
are you still in finals
hey
league
gay
ay league?
Hey. Who was right
Fuck I liked caenis
idk
Or Idk if we want to do 3 or really 2
Or Idk if we want to do 3 or really 2
Yo what do you want to do for campaign. Idk if I want a random to replace mars
aight
league?
finished with those
nah i gtg study for a final
aight lmk if it fixes
league
yea but i cant do shit tmrw
i think jetts coming back sunday tho so we can all hang
i went back to usc this morning to see christina
Usually just run two of the first two
Sf, kunka, mesusa, tide carry
Synergy is for idiots
I just do goblin mech start into the hard cc shit
So you can't talk that shit any more
Aight fucker. Also you're not higher than me in chess now
thats ok i was here for ur sister anyways
bang
fuck you im  here to hang ur mom
Are you home
Come out
I just woke up
I forgot you can just use a link for sharing files
It's just flavor
And I haven't even made them lol
They're like level 3
But heard of them from your captain
Recently enough you never met the others who are out on a mission
Yea
The other half of the 12
Npcs in your squad
i cant im in class lol
arenas is fastest
or just spam arenas
or pug a normal uldir run
do m+
C'mon bruh
Do you not read the chat 
To download it
Read the group chat there's a link to Google drive
Yea
Play my game tho
Yea
Are you joining me and Jett for BFa launch
New kai
Yikes spelling
Imacross the stret 
Mars didn't add him and Idk
Also Fuck you Michael. Your name is Parsa 
Nah you can keep them 
I'm just bored at work 
Oh nah. I just ate
Yea but I can text
That is what I said. 16th at night
Yes 
Yea essentially that
230 in the afternoon
15 hours ahead
I wouldn't know since I'm on my phone
The fuck is wrong with you tranny boys
What the fuck
Yea. It's a grove of burned trees and a ruin in the center
I'm thinking how to describe since I can't draw
Ok. You played tyrion so you know what he'd leave
Ok. Like a gold amount?
Across the street
I'm outside
You're boring is what you are
That's standard
I'm the best memer. No doubt
I got this for him
Nvm I left early
I'm in a review until 9
That's 2 feats and 2 stats
You can just be a jack of all trades 
Fighters get a ton of stats
But sorcerer is one of those classes it feels like you either are or aren't. Like becoming a sorcerer is a weird narrative
It'd be thematic kind of
Is she pure fighter
Lol why
Did you figure how she treats slaves
But they probably trust you anyway
But yea they know you're lying
If it's a dragonmarked house then it got the mark from one of the greater dynasty houses
Well he's also interested in gaining favor with the dynasty house that sponsors his
Plenty of powerful heroes exist but few threaten entire countries
It's probably why he's worried about them at all
I feel like he'd mention the part where they loosed a dark god 
What about knowing about what they did in volar
Otherwise you wouldn't know why they're in iyoguja
You should know what's happened
Weren't you on their tail
It's everybody's fight. Eventually she's going to go for your homeland
Didn't you tell the governor or alios about her existence
Idk. Not what I was thinking but good enough
Trust is much harder to gain
Honestly proof is easy with magic
Depends how much they like or trust you
Depends how much they like or trust you
Or not
Enough
Idk. Convince them a threat exists. Like how you normally do
Although that's pretty much what the goal is
Idk who you're talking about
No I think everyone knows
Yea but I'm in class 
All are bowed to either a dwarf gnome or elf kingdom
There's no empire or kingdom like gisildor where humans are sovereign
It's common for human nobles to sell out their citizens up the elves in return for not being conquered
Cause he'll have been there
You're gonna be the one that informs them of the brutality of the other continents though
That works
That works
I'd assume it's out of fear though
I guess you could say it's from a mind shackle
He'd know not to press the masters 
That's unrealistic from a slave or gladiator though
Iyogura
I think they'll go to the closer one

Probably not
Then the rest is just more dm guide expansions
Like they have basic rules that the player hand book and dm guide expand
It's just extensions to the basic rules which roll 20 has 
I think I'm still missing a few
Along with volo and monster manual
Pirated 
<ss type="wink">;)</ss>
I can just meet you at the theater in 30
So like where you at
I'm at tongva with Jerry rn
Don't tilt too hard
Well that sounds fun
Do you wanna come get food with me and Milo
Do you ever read your texts
Fuck you I'm stuck in lab
Around 630 tonight
Around 630 tonight
Around 630 tonight
i fought one that does and now i hate mine
also my odin is a bitch and doesnt hit 40k
and like a 10-15% average decrease in median and mean propagation times
average block rate nearly 4s faster with my network is insane
im clean as fuck
10% propagation speed increase on a large blockchain in 3 weeks
3 legendary scrolls 
did you see the new event
with the sript
hows it going
idk the syntax off memory
theres example code
google how to generate a random number python
parenthesis
()
also try datetime.now
import the pythongui thing
python is baby language so the interpreter sets types automatically which is why it runs slower than c
also you probably forgot to import random
instead of int var = 1
you do var = 1
python doesn't use type declaration
yea
but datetime is good enough for anything people won't want to hack
for TRUE random google uses a wall of lava lamps and takes images of it + atmospheric noise and runs it through a hash function to create a true random seed
i just use the current datetime cause that measures down to the microsecond
or every time you restart you'll have the same numbers generated
really important to seed your random with something inconsistent
import datetime
import whatever
random.seed(datetime.now)
randomVariable = random.randrange(start, stop[, step]) #use start and stop to set the range, can optionally include step to set the minimum distance e.g. whole numbers step = 1, useful for pixels)
rx = random.randrange(50, 100, 1)
ry = random.randrange(50, 100, 1)
moveto(rx, ry, randomVariable) #cicks anywhere between 50 and 100 on both x and y at a random time interval
#extend as needed
call me rq ill show you
theres no python terminal you run it on your regular terminal
ok you dont have python installed
in your terminal rq
type python --version
idk if it comes with all python versions
did you install pip3
54.158.146.87
as thats just artistic stuff
though i wouldn't worry too much about css
thats all chrome extensions are built on
specifically look at html/css/javascript
this is basically the bible for learning web dev
fair
with real world use to some degree
yea. or its at least a project to put on your resume
use it to scrape their data
download a google dev certificate
look up a tutorial for creating an extension
afaik the basic process is pretty straightforward
all programming starts with a google search and some stackoverflow
yea sure
theres already tutorials for how to
scraping google search data isnt that hard either
you can look into the documents for extension API
imo google won't buy it cause the emptiness of the front page is a big thing for why people use it but im sure people would download it as an extension
and often kinda retarded shit like &quot;am i pregnant&quot;
on normal days is it not usually the same 10 things
sounds good but whats the data on the typical top 10 most searched items of the day
ill text you in the morning when nathans here just be ready by like 11. ill pick you up
game?
nathans asking
was ok. you wanna hike tmrw
hbd
imo you were pretty shit to me and mars and miles and maybe even parsa cause they all wanted to run campaign and ik i was shit too cause my reaction didnt help. i took out the hurt of being blown off and having the results of all my time and soul flamed out on parsa to try to cool but that was wrong too. today too mars really wanted to give it another shot. havent talked to him but i assume hes stewing. i have no idea what to do now. i dont want to blame anyone for our group imploding but im also sad beyond words about it. you arent really a shit friend but the last week has been shit. im just really sad/disappointed rn and it becomes anger for me. fatal flaw 
pce
im gonna go help christina move out
that mc and terraria were better
milo you straight up said youd rather play video games than campaign
since this has all burned down let me say something. youve were a shit friend in the last week. you told me to my face how little you like campaign which i put my soul into each week. you blew us off at the last minute two weeks in a row which has wasted at least 4 hours of my time. i acted out because of how much you hurt me which didnt help but. idk fuck you dude
well shit
and mars and miles said they wanted to continue
idk it is weird for me too considering what was said but idk. i have a fellowship in a week so might as well have one last shot
yea
league?
bruh
leaving here at like noon-1
ig youll see this when you wake so &quot;today&quot;
you wanna go hiking tmrw with nathan?
aight
no
etc
set weather
and just play
like you can dupe your friend a set of your gear
so you dont have to farm unnecessarily
cause you can duplicate items
same. im super hyped for journey mode tho
and theres food tiers
also the well fed bonus got hugely buffed
well thats what they thought too lol
and golem enrages if you take him out of the temple
AI fixes to some bosses apparently
desert fossil is an earlier set now so it doesnt just gut skeletron
also boss cheese got kinda nerfed
makes it redundant anyway
well the buffs to everything else
than any fishing in hard
nah it does. fishing at the end of prehard was so much easier
you have to fish in hardmode to get hardmode or
no you just dont get hardmode ore from prehardmode chests
all the cheese strats
and nerfs to daedelus bow, holy arrows, reaver shark, fishing chests, etc
yea. huge amount of buffed items
but i hear its basically a whole new experience
interesting. i havent looked up spoilers or anything for terraria cause i wanna go in blind
whats happening
2 bosses and journey mode isp retty lit
journey's end is out on terraria
totally different note
Caught me on a second wind
Deadass haven't slept yet
I genuinely appreciate that
for pc you click the picture above where it says itch.io
it has download links
just go to the website
league? if not ask jett if he wants to level in wow
and not get any from the first anniversary hoh
wish i could just take both
theyre both pretty nuts
bering no lead and lower base spd but 2 turn silence
gemini spd lead but only 1 turn def break
yea theyre both strip + debuff
s2 is the multi-firecracker which is basically a spammable dot
dark kobold. s3 is like gemini where it strips 1 buff and silences 2 turns
but i have to pick between gemini and bering
FUCK the anniversary HoH is coming back
they banned me from the expo chat
hello
valorant gay
are you boomered out rn or you wanna game
we needed a panic room in terraria. its kinda sick ill show it to you next time<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1588918777845" ts="1588918777" t="61"></e_m>
we needed a panic room in terraria. its kinda sick ill show it to you next time<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1588918777845" ts="1588918777" t="61"></e_m>
ay league/terraria?
so theres at least time to come up with one needed
yea i tried to balance it in that the really abusable items at least dont start with a known recipe
ig
but fuck it if you guys can gather enough shit
the thing im more worried about is like mars crafting 30 alchemical frost or smth and then just having an extra 2d8 on that many arrows
kinda just have to see how it goes
yea thats fair. I think most of my recipes are 4 unique items but some call for multiple of the same
idk how you get up this early i feel like passing out again
plus like modified versions of existing ones. like greater healing potions or a thunderstone that knocks back further without deafening or whatever
and if the check isnt awful it creates something and a recipe gets added
throw together any animal parts and herbs that make sense
ay sick. thats basically the same idea i came up with
with a caveat that anything creative enough will create what you want with a check and balancing if needed
ay at some point lmk what you think of the alchemy and recipes. its pretty much a refined version of what we talked about during terraria
you wanna play league or terraria
actually its 18 months but fuck it thats really 2 years
if only cause 2 years of school seems rough
honestly down to change it up i think. gonna just talk to the adviser tomorrow and see but rn im leaning to the fellowship
they only cover master's if its a progressive degree at the end of your undergrad
I have to do the degree now if I do it otherwise usc wont pay for it
since id still have to do school and look for interships/jobs while at school
i think so too. like overall i think theres more value in doing an MBA but its riskier
management makes more money eventually tho
yea itd be a huge commitment in the summer for like 7 weeks but the degree is 2 years
team does suck. projects are individual i think but you work with team to talk about what youre doing or smth?
honestly both seem really good but idk
whats your opinion on one of these 2 options
1. progressive degree in the finance school doing global supply chain management. essentially I just get an MBA and use that to move toward engineering management
2. blockchain fellowship thing where essentially I build a project with a small team and then the program brings in companies to interview. its essentially a guaranteed full-time and well paying job 
league or campaign?
and any element
but with a 1/34 chance instead of 1/200
you dont just get any random monster it does the whole nat5 check
also i looked at the wish percentages and its actually weighted
maybe its com2us apologizing
you know i got 2 pretty good runes today
WHY THO
back now
yea just got done eating
do you still have that azir energy
also its instant and no login required
good. this is legit the optimal self-share
xd
and skype has auto sync
i just need to send that link to my laptop
dont lcick
theyre afraid
did you try heal-predator galio yet
idk sometimes when i get mid i like to play lux and let my team carry me xd
graciously taking the most impactful role in the game and making an impact
in soloq
btw what are you playing mid
but like a raki-tiana-galleon-zaiross cleave on shield/will can
zaiross just cant sweep a team
i dont think so. if i was gonna do that itd be with 2 lushens
real issue
actually i also cant speed tiana cause my zaiross and galleon are too slow
pog? just smurf on kids
shields good on her. her base hp is high as fuck
so people do like chiwu/tiana/triton based shield/will cleave now
vanessa triton on defense is unbeatable cause his base spd is 18 higher than her or smth
no i just cant make her fast enough to turn 1
honestly thinking of just making her will shield shield
Nah like what to rune and what to run with. At least for rta cause I don't have bellenus or rica
wait i have no idea what to do with this
NUT
with a tiana
blessing popped and saved me from a dupe bolverk
are you still vibin
are you still vibin
finish that terraria world before master mode xd. or something shorter
game
i literally work with logic on a daily basis and following these random ass ideas the way gigastoned incels from the dark ages did is hard
fuck philsophy is so weird
i gotta talk to my TA for 30 mins brb
sure lol. i have 7 days to go until my dimension energy is back
truly one shot any mon
yea its fun as fuck. thats why i want a violent one
can kill rakan in 2 turns 
also just really good dps in guild content
but you can slap shit like vanessa or deny their atk buffer turn 1
without atk buff you cant kill garo. can never 1 shot laika since her max hits is 3 and he liives with 10%
like daphnis
youre mostly looking to snipe units with under 22k hp
you can open with s2 tho since it doesnt stun
you cant control it lol. shit just happens
and then miss crit on the second
you have to be careful tho she can stun on first hit
no cr
yea for a turn 1 mina its swift spd cd atk
at least so far most people arent on will when cleaving
can counter cleave with swift oke mina and vanessa
was gonna give him frans set so +180 ish
swift oke vio fran 
im actually redoing rta runes rn
that both turn 1 and turn 2 can win
yea. vio nerfs in rta made it fair enough tho
turn 2 comps are legit
cause everyones on will
id just farm vio/will. the higher i get in rta the worse swift is
you can probably get further on vio sets tho
giants and dragons is equal imo
you want like 2-3 single target strips faster than her
the real reason hes swift is so hes faster than hathor tho
but then you cant do shit like one shot garo or laika
i always want to go violent
yea i like his stats a lot
wait no he was hp, now atk
i think he used to be on atk
my monkey is swift spd cd hp rn
theyre not all good tho lol. but thanks
It's just hard to rune so mines swift
And he cycles turns already
It's good. You can vio into 3 or into a team stun 
True. What's he runed
Should try to get the wins anyway. No real energy cost and potentially 2-300 crystals a week
I never do 4* towers they're fucked
are you doing guild siege
druids
actually theres a few all-good families
praha plus
oh shit its good now
oracles kinda if you think light isnt just scuffed paraha
light is bad but not awful
i think all the desert queens are ok
you literally cant proc out of 2 turn sleep 
actually thats why hathor is insane over jeanne
but you can still proc out of 1 turn
cause you cant proc out of 2 turn cc
if it elongated cc itd be good
its not even the cd thing now
Discernment (Passive): Decreases the chances of the allies being granted with weakening effects by 30% and increases the duration of the weakening effects that the allies, excluding those that are under inability effects, grant on the enemies by 1 turn each with the power of a piercing gaze. [Automatic Effect]
hes awful
oh right this fucker
whats the dark one even
they keep buffing rahul so hes good now
wait no shazam
beast monks are all ok
theyre just ok
not light/water
is dragon knights the only family good all around
dark one omegalul
thems the rules
there must always be a bastard child in each family
whos icaru
oof. i ran one on 85 for a long time
give immunity
his 2a literally did nothing
lmao true. also if bernard gave immunity xxd
although i did see a bernard orochi lagmaron core cleave
garo susano are tanky but orochi just dies
orochi needs a passive
oh wait 2a ramahan
i think its guild/area only 
i dont think so 
that isnt on the ninjas
actually is there any elemental speed lead
beast riders are good 
taor could use one
and never lose turn 1
also for rta cleave you can draft double ninja bastet draco
susano orion garo defense
then a vampire mina
im gonna do susano then a violent mina
which is rare after 2a
and i got nobody to build
i only crystal summon when all my mons are runed up
but farming is value
feel. its always tempting to summon
no go farm
exactly. and having 2 for pvp is nice
on vio nem
i built a second fran just for the rune guy actually
cat is just verde garo raoq
ive got like 90% success with fran vero darion khmun for the rune stage
i thought vero was a waste but he hard carries in lumel
but fire panda was a waste
i think i do too after i finished bale
and a built in stun on s1
against no immunity teams jeanne is hathor with 2 turns less cd on s3
if only you had jeanne youd know real broken toah strats lol
yea thats exciting. no ragdoll stage next time either
like molong and beast monks
honestly think she just keeps the real cancer out of the meta
since atharos is easier
on the bright side you know you can do it every month
im still salty
i got 3 dupes
bitch you got hathor monkey
is that lumel 5 guy
you know the hardest boss in this game
thats what matters
and homun dots
nice. i just cheesed it with the neal-rasheed permanent invincible
ragdoll is the worst shit. i runed a light fairy and rasheed just for it
ive only ever heard the garo solo lol
oh wait thats fucking insane
then its free
you dont have a garo at all?
when it ends
xd. see you in 20 minutes
ah. the real boss is game crashes
yea lmao. just auto 4head
should be. theres so much atk bar reduction between her fran tyron
turn denial &gt; more turns only in toah
nah use loren
if shes getting a move after shes stunned then swap someone for loren
if you get her 2 adds down the fights just over imo
yea thats what im saying. they have the same hp on 100 and 100h i think
and twins kill
and then tyron chain resets her bar while shes stunned
only the bitches but you can still slow her
all hard cc works on them
yea
mine is too lol it works
unless your homun is on the triple hit and not the absorb
might want to put tyron on vio so he can just keep reducing bar
fran to sustain past the revenge and twins nuke once shes stunned
tyron homun can keep her adds cced
tyron homun twins + fran?
hathors pretty weak for lyreth
you just might get unlucky with tyron cc
water twins works
the 99 mobs have like 4x the health of the junos
cause the trash isnt tanky
you can swap those 2 for twins for 100
and possibly mantura
i feel like baretta is the weak link
fire boom?
anyway yea do you have jeanne
stuck here till 150
otherwise yea
im in class with cam on
tyron + fire twins?
what do you have
may start getting them again lul
free glory each week and daily pack 2 buffs
bruh
ay yo
and then most people voted parsa over collin if it comes down to it
not 'santa monica' unless people are really into that name then its cool ig
part of the vrucurian empire under one of rei's descendants
so next campaign is on gigantia which i painted a map for but ppl wanted to do a line of sight thing so its partially fogged out until explored
kaede managed to stabilize and heal rei so she lives and forms her empire. the demon died instead of escaping and so the empire doesn't stay at war and is able to put up an outpost
you missed me talking a bit about what I had for next campaign which was mostly dependant on how this session went
literally just a workout regimen
lautrec
and chadicus forgiving lautrec afterwards, giving him a workout book and letting him enter other countries again so long as the party doesnt stray too far from him
you missed lautrec's 250 damage turn to send the demon back into the abyss
it turned out not the worst. we just finished combat
game
damn. ok boomer
game/code?
Yea. Water monkey rune instead of seara if it goes cd
its too good to give up
and now i think i have to keep that right
but i rolled 6 spd 6cr 7cd 8atk
i was gunning for spd cr atk def on the hp 6
aight
you wanna game or code in 30 when im done with office hours
200 energy a day event is kinda nice actually
but its comparatively slow
yea its not objectively slow
or 6 base and 4 grind
its +10 on each rune
you see what i mean by its a real good mina but its also slow and tank
this
wait not that
like youd never expect it
i mean it was well runed. just super off meta you feel
which is just so weird
someone i saw hit guardian rta with like a 23k hp +80 spd vamp mina
and just rage/fatal/broken dps
vamp with hp% to carry
vio dps
you got the typical swift sniper to go before bastet/daph and steal their turn
to the point i was gonna build a second
i was gonna say thats the thing. shes got like 4 viable builds 
also did you feel the earthquake just now
deadass op. 120 base speed so mine is 300spd and missing 2 grinds
did you build water cat yet
very likely will be so
OH also terraria 1.4 5/14
mars duck game. 5 min
and the rest of the ingredients are just whatever the fuck you want
i found worchestershire sauce in the fridge by chance
you should. its dank
shit was good
made shepherds pie
wassup

im 1 rune off
we can go first and call or smth
well jerry didnt get the scroll yet so he'll do it later
rough
also go nap or youll boomer out on us
gross why
how tf did you speedrun it
damn im still on the runes
laika too if you can make her s2 deal 35% of his hp each hit
and just snipe him
so you can take turn 1 against shit like daphnis
she always crits unless they have debuffs
yea all spd atk cd
120 base god
deadass after grinds i have her at 300 spd
im still on the giants one cause i went and evolved mina lol
unlucky
Fuck
Good
Xd get food
Get tesa he's good
Yea. I can wait a bit
also rip 300 gp. wasted on ifrits
rip jerrys at work till 2
just got runes and grinds left
im done with the first one
true. 40 day event tho
for sure 18 spd then as close to 8% atk 8% def 6%cr as possible
double into spd
im looking for spd cr atk def on both
and then change their power up to 6 as mmmuch as you want
you can reroll them until you get the ones you want
i did one hp 6 vio and hp 4 swift
whatre you making for your runes
br
oh shit yea. fire or wind bm
to get her
for a blessing
im ready to feed any nat 5 i get
i just want a seara

deadass
i keep getting mystics
damn youre faster than me
ecks dee. same here actually
after lunch
if he doesnt answer then like 2 hours?
lemme text jerry and see
rip. gl
did you notice the toa rainbowmon come evolved now
yea i got cucked too on 5. turn that shit off 
whatre you running for griffon b5
i got toa and shit all done. will have all my scrolls tomorrow
lmao its like youre having a stroke
the good rewards are always on your lowest run
pog world boss devilmon setting up for the trans scroll 
game?
they give coins like halloween candy which i didnt expect
got my 100 scrolls tho. just toa and the mission left
nah its all attributes on weekends
big f
having to wait till friday
gotta clear all elements b10 and im not wasting crystals on unlocking them
well shit im softlocked on missions
near the middle
yea its in the second list
so
although you probably need it too
no wait i got one
then jamire wasnt a curse
we'll see. if your first offering is like a bael
zoom xd
so its guaranteed
well youll have a trans scroll
whenever youre done gathering scrolls you wanna call and mass summon like the old days
im still looking for an SD
which mission are you on
both just better rakan
same thing
xeratu xayah
cant feed a rakan but cant use him either
blessing &gt; most nat 5
so GZ free blessing when you get the missions done xd
actually if you didnt know its for the missions it wasnt from the trans
because i need to farm 3* pieces for a mission
from the trans or just mystic
ay go craft a secret dungeon
i dont wanna be able to awaken shit cmon
fucking mission isnt counting my essences and im farming more than i want to ree
nut
i get to save 4 4* a week
fuck the free nat5
oh guild rainbowmon is 5* now
which is huge pog for me
they added a bunch of new missions that give at least 1750 crystals, 1 devil, 1 leg, 1 trans
yea its back
event got way crazier
Pog
Free trans scroll crashes sw
oh right. you read the staff and understand what it wants from you right
you guys in skype or what
yea i was gonna brand
aight
when at
yea sure
sup
milo to me
yea i think im done but it might change slightly in the next week. under the relics tab
stronger than both slightly but with the heavy condition of remaining true to Ra in action
its lucias relic essentially, as durendal is to lautrec or leitnaught will be to penny
im mostly done with the dawnstaff
also are you going back to light cleric now or serving an aspect of Ra more focused on lightning
you doing clash?
its insane. especially since theres no daily cap so even if youre unlucky youll still get it eventually
what the actual fuck
wait is this literally just 2 vio hp% with 18 spd min
wait you also get to roll them to 6
with a second event giving 2 legendary runes of choice
no meme 100 MS, 2 devilmon, 5 reapp event
aight
after then
game?
leauge or wack game
i gotta hold office hours till 4 but you wanna league or finish our terraria world or smth after lmk

holy shit
c9 clean as fuck
you still playing?
Back. Logging 
im down but i need to walk home first
h
bru
league. parsa?
exactly 20 damn
ok league
League 20 minutes
idk think about it
you meet sick people and shit
the jobs are WAY better than retail
yea but uni is actually fun
take loans or work on campus
commit to a 4 year degree
or you could apply to a university
yea. you need to be either really funny or really skilled
but eventually even i'll have to
and i hate searching and dont even want to work
which sucks cause real jobs suck
if you want out
thing is you kinda just have to graduate and get a real job
i was meming but it doesnt really hurt to try
stream content xd
or start a twitch
and then you can charge more too
do engineering assignments cause theyre really fast if you know what youre doing
dont do shit like papers tho
i considered doing like freshman coding assignments cause chinese kids will give you like 300 for 3 hours of work
ik you can do shady shit like do people's homework for money
i feel like you cucked yourself switching lol
are you actually committed to any major
like its kinda school related but not direct tuition 
you cant take student loans to pay for not school right
TA a course then you can get like 2 hours paid for every 1 you work
our school pay is still better than uniqlo
hm. what about like working on campus
werent you getting paid by the govt for school
the paid ones are usually solid. 25+ an hour
go back to college full time and look for internships
yea. youre doomed
damb. like in the middle or at the end
game up?
ayy
u good?
aight
aight. imma submit my hw then
are nigh
gamer hours
aight
league?
relogging
so fucking nice for qol
and once everyone ready it auto starts
oh also they fixed r5 so you can ready as lead before everyone loads in
Theo thicc
ecks dee
its harder thinking without hard variable types for me than it is to remember hard typing
and i want to die because python is cancer
oof. ive been doing interview shit all week
fair. im busy this week anyway so lets just say next week
you looked at the code i sent yet?
also you have the rta/normal runes now so you can do both

just dont tire yourself out before 9 boomer
right
n i g
Gwyn, 2:29 PM
we need more summoners
aight lmk
so game?
and a vector of vectors is a 2d array
but one that is always resizeable so you can always push_back and itll just update its size
vector&lt;&gt; is just an array for this purpose
just look through it see if you understand it
or if you call ./life &lt;testfile&gt; it cleans all files generated by the program for that test
you can call it with ./life &lt;testfile&gt; &lt;iterations&gt; &lt;optional&gt; if you put smth in the optional itll run in slow mode and you can see the animation frame by frame, otherwise it dumps them all at once
idk how far you got with the math but you should check this out too
oof. i just walked around bullying kass/amumu
kha fair
16/0/1 15 minute game
int me
duo
wait flex q
yo game?
im guessing you never told her she sucks outside top
mission failed. we'll get them next time lmao
lmao
thought i was muted 
lul
ngl i meant to tell gwyn i just dont gank her lane cause she has me muted and its never successful but it came out more fucked than i meant it
no ssd for skype
just didnt account for potato boot
waited an extra minute for meme
nah pretty clean
its time

734
game
back
aight 
League?
im gonna sleep. go read my crackhead comments and try to see whats clear and what isnt lol
yea youd fit 
what
bit
also that jesus guy in the casual tournament looks like you
i think the hardest ones are square root, mean/median/mode
a lot of the stuff in there is explained and theres functions stubs to fill out. you can also look at the things i wrote and see how they all work
thats what i did cause my old ass vm doesnt have shared folder lol
idk if you got your shared folder working but you can always email this ot yourself and open your email in the VM then download it
I can only spd so much
Wait fuck u
Ok I'm like 10 min from home
Told jett 30 min if your in
Also I'm tryns play league
Ikr. I feel enlightened
gigabyte brain
so that lushen sees low hp enemies and actually uses s3
so i build gb10 and db10 with julie first
lushen is actually brain damaged 
only pierrets consistently use s3 
ok hear me out
pce
dude hates women and has like a 3rd world mentality
but ok
hes fucked in the head
i swear
hes playing the longest con on you
ngl thats weird as fuck that you video called a guy in india you dont know
why tho
what the fuck
wtf
have you talked to him
when in doubt, guarav will bail you out
blessed be indian tech guys online
or google errors and get indian people to answer how to fix it
i deadass go there every time i code to look for syntax stuff
or cppreference
also for every coding problem theres an answer either on stack overflow
ok cool. just wanted to mention its possible
or even the name of a folder to search in
an example of a more powerful way to utilize this is when you wanna pass in a file name
like ./math 1 2
just change how you call it
that way you dont have to recompile when you want to change the numbers you run with
so like if you have a math program you can make your main smth like
main(int argc, char* argv[]){
if(argc != 3) {return}
cout &lt;&lt; add{argv[1], argv2} &lt;&lt; subtract(argv[1], argv[2]  &lt;&lt; pow(arg1, arg2) etc
}
argv[1]+ is the first, second, third, etc thing run on the command line
argv[0] is always a pointer to the start of the program so don't use it
and argv is an array of inputs
so you can put int main
if(argc == 0){
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;not enough parameters&quot; &lt;&lt;endl;
return -1;
}
argc is the number of parameters
and running with ./program var1 var2 var3 etc
by changing its signature to (int argc, char* argv[])
oh btw i forgot to say earlier you can pass variables into the main function
yea thats what im trying to say
ok that was weirdly phrased lemme rethink it
which is the goal
drunk would just make you retarded
yea. weed would slow you down tho
winners get lit
get some boys and do casual brawls
actually that sounds fun as fuck
this makes so much more sense 
winner drinks
wait its a drinking game
lmao
well thats how he lost
new meta

yea
i used to do that and it gets really hard to remember
even if you really want to write fuck = shit + retard
use int length_x instead of int shit or int fuck
you should still name them well
variable names DONT matter
until then, remember these primitive data types. they come included in c++ so you don't need to include them
int - between ~-2bil and 2 bil. only whole numbers, rounds down. int 2 / int 3 == 0
double - number with decimal points. twice as large as an int. double 2.0 / 3.0 == 1.5
char - character, use single quotes. char x = 'a'
bool - boolean true or false, can be initialized as 0 (false) or 1(true)
lmk when your vm is done so i can walk you through making a program
you must have one to execute
which will run its main() function which is a special one in c++
then the command line can run it wiht &quot;./program&quot;
it abstracts all that for you so you only have a .o
C++ works in the following way. code file (.cpp) is run through a compiler which creates a .o file by linking the files #included in the cpp and creating machine code from the functions
e.g. I dont code each bit to move, i write logic that is then broken down automatically into machine code then into physical movement
when you have a problem, you simplify it through abstraction
which is the idea of abstraction
data types are all 1/0 but they are interpreted as being smth else
or smth else
trying to set int to string
would only work if function() has int as a returntype, otherwise its a data type conflict
so if I have returntype int, I return a number when called. e.g. int X = function()
so functions have a return-type, the data they return when called
data also has a type, such as an integer(8-bytes representing -2^32 to 2^32), char(1 byte as a letter), etc
we call these functions
so a really quick rundown of programming is you break down the problem into simple parts
cause he answers all student questions himself on piazza
writes instructions like this for every lab and never sleeps or smth
yea. theyre written by the prof im working for. dude is insane
but this is much faster
its the same idea. linux 32-bit
good its super out of date
so you can drop files in from your regular pc and have them in the vm
folder
i can just send you a thing to install the one i'm using. its super detailed instructions and even tells you how to set up a shared fodler
java requires a virtual development environment like eclipse
ok cool. c++ runs best on a virtual machine because then we have the same exact output right
c/c++, Java, even python somewhat are object-oriented and learning one means you can jump to the others easily by just looking up new syntax
i think OO is better fundamental tho.
but a lot of quick-build stuff is in untyped languages because its much easier to hack smth together
its way more useful on &quot;real&quot; development teams
c/c++ vs javascript
you want to do object oriented programming or untyped languages
ok wait let me back up here rq
the basis is just object-oriented programming
yea for sure. C++ or java or python
if you want
i can teach you basic coding
thats fun
i mean yea why not
is this your podcast with gwyn
yea exactly. anything else you wanna do or
so i dont think im actually gonna pull through lol
im a degenerate and its what i want. i promised christina id walk with her tho
ngl im down to drive to sc and play league then drive home
is it going to stay there tho
saved pog
you wanna do smth else
rip. guess you wait it out
is he in socal
-scuffed grim guzzler, 2018
ye. round up the lads
understandable. we can gather goons for scribblio or smth too
its showing at the broadway 4
was either gonna work on dnd all night or see parasite with christina
im home so i cant league lol
aight
Is it still scuffed
Are you still looking to see parasite
New York strip with mushroom cream pasta
Hard
Cooking
She's too into him Thu
Ever realize Hilda is into her brother
Sad pete
little gay boy sad
Ashe sad
And then dedue at like 7ft
There were 2 heights in that game. 5'7 and 6'5
Edelgard isn't half his height
He's not that tall 
Lmao Hubert
Where's part 2
He's just her lapdog
I don't like edelgard and Hubert tho
It's quality
I fuck with that
Yea obv
But I'd instantly vote anyone who would
Ik. Nobody is pushing for it
Tax religion
More money for nasa
More money for research
You know what nobody talks about that I really want to see
Slow and measured is safest
So we know abd can stop any time
I want to see change on the scale of 20 ish years
There's no reason to push it in a year
We can afford a decade to reverse the trend
I think slow change is better
In the right way
I just don't think drastic change will solve it
But yea it is a bad trend 
If my career is as projected I'd be in the 1% lol
Idk yet
They might find a more electable guy
They might find a more electable guy
Who knows if Republicans are even gonna goon trump
And others just want to stay the course
But the delta change of some candidates is really high
Trump sucks don't get me wrong
Spectrum changed your ping 
But I don't want to risk change
Right. It is
That's all I'm saying. Tax is already so fucking brutal
And food 
130k is 65 after tax which covers 40k rent
It's a third of the money I have to spend 
Actually it's 2/3 if we both lose 5
Losing 1/3rd is a lot
Projected after tax and housing and food our take home would be like 15k 
Especially because of property tax
Sf CoL and SM is insane
Their cost of living is way lower
That isn't really affordable
It's just a lot to give up
Right and they'd fall under that category. So would Christina and I if we marry
5k is significant when your take home after tax is already 1/2
Even for me and Christina we need the money
I already told you my parents owe like 60k. Any hit to bottom line is devastating
Like any increase in CoL would fuck me
Idk. I don't have even 5% to spare
Along with housing
Right but to do so cost of living will raise for middle-upper class
But ultimately this is too much change with too much risk. There's just too much to lose all for happiness others will feel and not us
That's a good point
And naivety is the bane of leaders and nations
It looks like naivety to trust and value your fellow man
There will always be unhappy and destructive people. I just don't see trusting society to work is a proper order
Right but in civ5 1 happiness kept the same benefit as 100. People only need to be minimally happy and that was best achieved through autocratic policy
I don't think we can ever trust anyone we aren't extremely close with and I certainly don't value them as highly. His policy weakens the checks we have in place that protect us from others at their own cost
Basically my problem with Bernie is he puts too much trust and value in other people
sick
i got till 6 when christinas out lol
aight lmk
q
lets fuckin go
ay
you ping fixed?
DL

Jerry and I are right by there rn lol
I fucking asked you if you were
I'm at my pc for like 2 hours
League?
its like bluffing in poker. do they call you out on him being unruned or ban him and give you the good 4
yea check out my underruned triton
hes just a defense bitch
idk why i got so excited
TRITON THO
triton tho
?
good. self destructive behavior is the way to be
are your eyes better
ah ok. nbd then
any of the important shops
which 2
there were 2 accidents at the intersection between me and campus last week
cursed ass city
wouldve been
bruh
and dont want to work
bc i need to cook soon
1 league game
aight
today is the day of one-game players
doing 1 with parsa rq
ez ekko jg game
get in
got mars
you wanna play a quick league game
cheesing legend fights is more fun than no items stock bs
thats the only reason i do spirits
the pvp in that game sucks
playing online tho
you can get a truly disgusting 15k power build with black knight on a FE character
so theres no point
i finished spirits shit tho
im sure
thats bullshit
i just like that upair spike
at least the sword should be fast
whys she so slow
residentsleeper
this is all just people practicing vs ai
with like 4 people and items
i wanna see dumbass casual byleth
does alpharad stream at all
yea. i know 0 of these streamers tho
where tf is byleth
dont go out theres fucking coronavirus out there man
why you got shit?
so im skipping classes
someone at usc has corona
im on league withh jet rn
or if its our degenerated age
u want to see if it really is the gwyn curse keeping us from winning
I'm here
aight cool
im going back to school. wanna play league in like 45
this is your major. cmon
xd
excluding words part of a set of banned words
hmu with the algorithm to find the most common word in a paragraph
and i do coding shit 
aight. im just chilling and listening to this bs while we watch a movie
lucias off time goes pretty much perfectly. rolled 99/100 on her success. so anything achievable in the time just happens. lmk what it is
mars n i are on
its real scuffed
where you literally are a dude who can only rotate and kick
i saw some rabbit game. super rabbit boy or smth
all i have on laptop is skribblio lmao. unless you wanna find some scuffed shit on steam
after?
oof
or like anything?
scribblio
and they brought out keiths fucking mom
lol goldenglue is literally the only NA mid
shes 245 so all the single target strippers have to go first right
literally building the whole team around hathor
also i completely redid my runes and its nut
DAMN
&quot;Both halves of the marriage banned out&quot;
x d
&quot;BUD LIGHT ACE&quot;
lcs is scuffed
bruh
and a shield that doesnt look like fucking banshees
bless
damn they gave naut hook an outline
idk im tryna see that YEET
Sad I didn't get to see it live
There's also a major crash on the intersection between school and my place
All that practice filling in bullshit handouts in HS paid off
Nvm I'm a legend and finished that lab in half the time
leg
you wanna play league in an hour ish
d
real trick is sac 4* every week for scroll pieces x
BRUH HATHOR
scribblio?
but still strong as a conquerer should be
im cool with that. i had a good combo for nalla that should be fairer than the cheese
oh. idk what i meant for the storm giants to imply was that omega and syvana were hunting goliaths and their civil war was driving them to extinction
killing both sides is some sociopath shit
or smth
i was thinking like you have to negotiate peace or wipe out the other tribe
y i k e s
idk
if you guys feel like its been long enough north i can cut it down
and the 2 tribes are too caught up in their blood feud to see it
idk. i was thinking of going with that whole thing where the storm giants talked about the goliaths making themselves go extinct
and killing her
as soon as we said we were going north he started talking about a weapon
no he definitely has
his rivalry with his sister is all he ever mentions
its true. i feel like bamdul deserves more of a story than that though
i guess
i did suggest it
feels like the shift from stopping syvana from pursuing lichdom with people from another world to fighting bamduls sister is huge
i guess fuck it
you know that would be interesting
its just a stat comparison
yea but 2 bearbarians whacking each other for 10 rounds sucks
so i need a new thing for her
true but he yoinked the barb subclass i statted her with originally
cause i feel like thats really dank
is it BM to make Nalla the same sentinel/polearm master cheese
yea i feel. everythings so fucked right now
its tilting the shit out of me actually
cause i dont want to work or have an offer yet
but like idk graduating soon may be stressing me out
you can make it into a really good one so i do that
like if it rolls into 17 or 18 spd and 2 % subs and like 1 flat
i use a lot of them now xd
also just start keeping blue runes
ik. im kinda just waiting for the rta rune change so i can put my good sets on shit for gw
its somehow better i guess
same, ive just been using the f2p resources
just like. life tilted. its weird
idk why but i keep feeling tilted these days and summoned all my crystals away
81 4* rainbowmon
its just my old one
nah i got a mouse
but id play scuffed
id be down to play league with the boys or smth too
which is pretty gay
duck game, overcooked, armello, plague inc, scribblio
theres a real short list of playable games with a trackpad lol
undercookedtale
which sounds dank actually
cant league here tho unless you wanna play tft
yea sure. idk if i want to go outside either
could be taco bell
panda aint bad
10/10
figgy balsalmic pork chop. orzo and carrots and mushrooms on the side
ngl cooking is kinda lit
damb
im getting real good. +10k off those suprising victory bonuses by always betting on the underdog xd
we could get drunk and predict smash matches
aight im good
yea ofc. i gotta cook and eat too
the most skillful of games
come over and 1v1 me in spirits smash with all items on high
i told christina id cook with her before you answered. oof. im down to grab smth or just hang afterwards tho. shes doing rp till like 11
same
also do you want to get dinner or hang out or smth. christina is doing weeb rp
more badges or cheaper wings pls
&quot;more changes coming in february&quot;
you can set units with RTA runes seperate from non-rta runes too. can finally have pog gw mons and still do rta
also rta is balanced pog. if you vio, enemy has +5% chance, if they vio, you have +5%
U free later
just anything to keep me away from smash and writing
or more league
omegalul
ah ok. you wanna play overcooked then
they didnt nerf the crit
disgusting
were there actually patches
just no smash pvp
im down to do like risk of rain or aom
yea ik
im deleting the game
the day i play another person in ultimate
i literally only do spirits shit
no pvp
and i hate smash
are you tryna play. i need a break from writing and its league or smash
w t f
its gemi
which one is the phantom
bro how tf are you online on 2 accounts
laika LUL
or a fire mon
was thinking ritesh
no perna sadly
with idk who as +1
ye. gonna make a jeanne chandra defense
couldve been better. couldve been gany. couldve been worse tho. couldve been bael
pog?
i got chandra off ss
o
add jerrys acct
smurf q
shit show
dbz
but some of the shit was just so forced
i didnt see that
its a BIG yikes
did you see the sett spotlight
ready]
im
aight
brb gotta go help cook
and get a 50% damage increase
i think its so yas cant buy one for 800g
ziggs buff is NUT tho
not the items building out of it
its just the cloak
I'll join up right after. Like 7
Running late. Gonna cook first
its like an hour journey
oh ok. ill just go shop till then
i cant tell
or is that just saying youre busy
ok do 1 rq then?
i gotta go grocery shop around then
im on jerrys
aight im ready
so thats good timing
i need to let christina in in like 10-15
im down
and not just &quot;this is demon scarecrow. give money pls&quot;
if they write some good shit
i fuck with it too
this is the year of weird eldritch horror champs
is so sick
his new walk with the demon arms out
very cool
very creepy
did you see that fiddle prototype
after that game
i finished placements silver 3
l m a o
cursed me
my 35% wr
true
ok im relogging
its kinda tempting to actually
also did you get the bag with prestige points
ay placements
Holocaust Jesus is there
its not but Jewboy Jesus is
i wanna see if Jesus the Jew is free
omegalul
&quot;Iran is ban&quot;
is vague enough to not get the hammer
maybe &quot;Iran to glass&quot;
its a fine line
yea but thatll get banned
you could trigger a lot of ppl with a name like &quot;RIP Epstein&quot;
is that available even
yikes lol
lol thats good
i just think its kind of gross
no wtf
yea its kinda dank
or some other less weeb shit
ay should i rename to Cucky the clown
patcching in rn
but yea either way
theres like a 99% change you place silver
do placements with me so we stay bronze
placed bronze 1 on ccool
i need my fix
ay bitch
cya
polar opposites make for good content
cause michael reeves is a crackhead and its great
the only streams i watch are lilys
and i have no rank
now that my mechanics are rusted as fuck
im so down to play
idk why
but cant stand watching it
i want to play league again
toast and janet broke up so i cant even get that content
but everythings bad now
yea feel
thats some quality ass content
and his true facts about animals
you ever watch zefrank
and im just out here rooting for the cleansing of inhumans
bitches really be out here saying she's a justification of japanese imperialism
dude people HATE edelgard
he didnt finish 3 houses tho
my favorite is emerald with mudkip only
right
fuck this isnt 4
tbh i dont like the smash stuff but his fire emblem, pokemon, etc shit is good
i would sub but i feel like im 7 years older than the core audience
he did a world of light nuzlocke which is dank as fuck
did you ever watch a guy called alpharad
pce. im sleeping too
yea exactly. cant mark me off if you cant prove im wrong
cause theres no answer anyway
i saw it and was like shit, theres no way they cant give me an A
wack ass course
its philosophy of fucking TIME TRAVEL
gimme a job and get me ot
also i have a philosophy discussion tmrw and i want to die. fuck school
so fuck them
yea exactly. the rules as written make no sense for a story
since by the dmg calculator hydrius shouldve been like cr 13
i just realized after hydrius that you guys had way too much available
but i think itll balance out the party utility
and if it doesnt work we'll go back
yea theyre actually usable this way
most overworld spells are ritual
thats a ritual so it doesnt matter
after the change i think they can be closer to the dmg balance weight
rn theyre all super deadly because the party can blow full resources on them
yea. im adjusting encounters down to compensate anyway
while keeping the narrative
yea so i think this is the best change for balance
so that you get multiple encounters and short rests every long rest taken
this change is a variant of the rests for open-world focused games
so then long rest features are always up and are op
but for everything open world theres no way you get attacked 8 times in a day like the DMG suggests for balance
and sleeping 8 hours isnt an option
cause theyre for dungeon crawls where the halls are teeming
usually they make no sense narraive wise
cause those right now also suck
nights are short rests. you can still get hit die and short-rest features back
or can we afford to camp in this foreign land for 3 days to get them back
like do we push forth without our resources
id rather it be a narrative decision for the party
The day of the week changes tho. Days with fights or hard travel won't count toward rests
3-4 dangerous encounters every full rest of resources
Actually I think 7 days light activity for full rest is my favorite. With 1 day of no activity counting double
Hydrius can carry some utility now anyway. He has nowhere else to go xd
The 2 full casters and paladin are outperforming the barb/rogue hard
They're meming you
You put out top utility, damage, heals already tho
though im personally attached to 5 days of no activity or 10 days of light activity, with the ability to mix
figuring out what a long rest is by vote
btw we're doing each 8 hour night is a short rest now
its a pessimist yea
i guess by the name
idk what a doomer is tbh
lmao
no im racist
xd
me
idk who that is
who doesnt like cocaine
lul
fair. its kinda arabic for me tho
chic?
its nice
oh yea ik that place
or like a private thing
which restaurant
thats always fun
true lulw
not a bad way to get some ez legends
you do get points free for spirits and shit tho
you dont even bet lol
is such a fucking shitshow
dude spectate mode in smash
nvm
play scribbl
vro go home
are u home
xd
played more of it this year than league
rn i think its still chillin
ig
True but they should do really interesting ones
Special league sucks anyway 
I'd honestly be ok with like 6 week season. 1 week special
And special league every other season idk 
Or make rta seasons shorter
Do a post rta season and mid season patch
Just need to patch more imo
Riot take notes
But then their counters are buffed eventually
Just some stuff should get nerfed but doesn't for a while
Like nothing ever becomes stupid op or shit really
Their patches are always really sold
2a mina is oppressing daphnis rn
actually the 2a cats are nuts
or farmable
a lot of the top tier mons are 2a cats or 4*
which is so weird
like the meta is good now
the patches made a lot more nat 5s viable
souls truly crushed now
saw a clip where she killed a julianne through trianna, vanessa, his, and a hwadam passive
its insane
s3 is fully: no glancing hit, bypasses resist death effects, prevents revives, buffs her with soul protect on kill
you can slap a bitch rq
like if you run that into fran/verde/loren
but has 12 more base speed and doesnt need to pass acc
she doesnt hit as hard as daph when he def breaks
and 1700+ against 2 buffs
so against a will runed mon her s3 has 1500%+ ratio
brandia gets 50% against immune targets and 30% per buff or debuff
ignores trianna vanessa hwadam julianne 
also no glancing on s3
so garo, miho, theo, etc
ye. raki ignores resist death effects AND revives
we've entered the upside down
and raki is better than ethna
unrelated note brandia is now daphnis
ye
is character building xd
and i like it because talking it out and deciding
i think theres 2 plans where to go next
but relevant
it was pretty autistic ngl
That's a long shot
True. Hopefully he read what mars had to say but 
Shared autism and all that
I feel like only you can tell what he thinks
Ah. You think jett saw the 815 change
Tf it's 2
Pce
Rip. Sleep then. I'm gonna watch streams or smth
:thinking: 
Or create 
Instead of imagine
Why'd you say make up then
Bruh wtf
Does your laptop support external keyboards
Asians xd
Also you'd be surprised. None of Christina's friends parents know her name and her parents don't know her friends names
Just those letters
Not the full thing
Aight tell him hbd for me
Or is that weirdchamp
Oh right. Does he know me enough for me to tell him happy birthday
Aight. For sure
Nm. Nothing to do on laptop
Ay 
Smh
Degenerate
Ey nig
: (
im close to getting christina back as a casual
im lonely out here nigga
join guild
play sw again
bruh
: )
For now you need Anna to free you from the ice
For now you need Anna to free you from the ice
You are the magic spirit
Cause that was a G move
Barring deliberate fuckery
We'll see. I'll make it so you can save her

gonna get your kiss of the decade in
what about new years eve
yea its smth alright
scuffed as FUCK
its not a day off?
wyd for new years
yea. rn i just run her with vanessa and hope they dont have their spd lead
like 290 is faster than most people's woosas and shit
yea ik but if it was 3 into spd she'd be at +170 which is NUT
and i hate it
but its only 12 spd base cause 2 went into cdmg 
its efficient as fuck. like 90% pre-grinds; only missing an innate roll and like 2% on def%
rn her slot 4 is the shit runes
only 23/24
reapped from 3 flat def rolls to 3 spd rolls
lol. i got hella lucky with her slot 6
bitch thicc
ey you like my ethna tho
xd
fuck you want more
bolverk
bitch you have ethna wind panda 
theres 2 devilmon events rn and i told the guild to accept your join request
also get back on sw
but maybe not until next next semester
cause theyre moving it out of our program
i feel. rn its like 50/50 if we have to take this bullshit hard class next semester
yea but like if its every friday thats scuffed

even if you finish whatever your goals are there quick itll be a place that can be returned to
trust me i put a lot of surprises in the northlands
kinda dank actually
its like some real chaos shit
invention

CN level 12 witch who apparently &quot;blows through like a tornado&quot;
ig more like witch
oc wizard
powerful ones tho. pacification will be easier than killing them
its gonna be elementals xd
also elementals

you know the weirdest thing about vacations tho
I was only in San Fran over thanksgiving 
Nah nigga Iâ€™m taking finals. Going to Taiwan Wednesday morning
I'm at usc
Wut
ill get u the first one and we do the 31 scrolls over call or smth around christmas
27s instead of 31
pog af
the r5 shit with janssen
It was in the same situation just with people you agreed to be with vs ones you were with at that second
Nigger we're also gone all winter
is different
like cancelling last day vs cancelling 3 days ahead
yea but there was an implicit obligation to go to session 
though im still salty you last minuted dipped us for last campaign of the month/year/decade
and shit
and who we are
we have a month to get them up to speed with lore
i think itll just be a thing we try out
before how well session went anyway
the whole idea was kind of spur of the moment
we know theyre cool
if he doesnt scare them off
thats what mars is kind of doing lmao
but mars said collin is pretty cool
cause we kind of asked for the perfect player
idk if we'll end up getting 1
yea those were the consensus picks
top 3
so
Read the replies and lmk your top 3 tho
That we voted on as the coolest
I had mars message 5
especially that double leo
ngl these AOs are pretty galaxy brain
this is the cleave guy
pick up
aight vro
one sec
yaqoob mohammed
no it was yaqoob
and how his number was marked &quot;scam likely&quot;
everytime i hear vro now i think of him
some indian guy named yaqoob was my microsoft support for when our game server went down
hello
same
fucking jett missed the whole hook about goliaths last session tho
rn im just doing campaign
did you think of anything to play
yea
they deny you burrito?
damb
im just bored and games facilitate conversation
anything really. we could smurf or you get on jetts steam and play risk of rain. or overcooked, tft, etc
lets game. i have to work after dinner
oh right
its too early to be coming back but too late to be going
wtf
are you going to work
where at
yea im only 3 games in
no zhonyas either
no i was like 16/2
fun
one trick diana in silver
they said this should be more technical
hopefully
yea but still. redoing is so gay
im lowkey amazed the roblox interviewer was so bad they called for a redo
its smurfing time
i got placed silver 2
yea
i just gave her yen's runes instead lol
ye
no runes
got talia
shows ya girl got money
i fuck with it
but also definitely for women
some of it is sick
ngl
i kinda like it
it looks so fucking good
did you see the witcher trailers
oh fuck it was jett that played lol
could do that
grindea got updated a bunch
you wanna play smth after. i dont want to study today
yo
team
Blessed be
ok
rip
and tilt will free me
im in a writers block
1 league game rq
i need to do campaign and papers after anywy
understandable
kill me
im free of animation
t e a m
someone should slap that bitch with her own truancy laws
lmao
to out
bro mf kamala harris dropped from like 2nd
i got until like 630
yea
1 league game before i suffer in animation for 3 hours
you free?
ok
reeee
typing hard
game rq?
Lol either way too much liability 
We lose 
Gets banned
Ww every game
Parsley
Or jg
Aight. Do we know a mid 
Cause bot is the important side by far rn
Yea but jg is easier with aggressive adc supp 
Ideally are you mid or supp
He's aight. Not aggro tho
Should we ask Diego for clash
lmao
and his accent is so fucking great
daniel craig is a southern detective
also don johnson
no but patrick stewart, the last james bond, and captain america are
is an amazing film
oh also knives out
thats toxic
imagine &quot;jinx yuri hentai&quot; on your back with the diamond icon and the literal word &quot;diamond&quot; on a shirt
oh no this shirt has ign on it
instead of weaving
since shes rewarded for staying on a person
yuumis more toxic now tho imo
on riot
ranked reward is the ability to spend more money
maybe better than lulu
but also shes single handedly the best anti-assassin support now
so maybe
ok at least you can kill her easier
b r u h
why is her heal so large
that change is so questionable it hurts
or draven building only ad and having 1.8as
but youre talking about xayah hitting 2.0+ as with 2 items
kaisa benefits less cause she builds double as
like xayah
thats actually insane on adcs that already build 1 as item
who needs movespeed when you get 3k gold of stats
is so broken
holy FUCK new zoomies
at least she doesnt follow tp
now you just really afk ride
taking the skil out
hmm
but it grants more stats
w has a 5s cd if she gets cced
oh nvm these are nerfs
q hurts less and lasts less time
her shield got bigger and restores mana
oh shit saved
oh fuck they buffed yuumi. we need to get a girl to just afk on the cat
jett fs
ideally
whos team
also clash is back this week and next
or apprentice
apparently that irelia is fakers replacement
theyre straight worse than a lesser star counter type one
what are neutral spirits even for
i thought he was chrom for some reason
yea that fucker
its op as fuck on marth cause theyre same series for that stat bonus
i have it
if thats the enhanced chrom or whatever
victini broken spirit
because those are bitchmade
only 2 green 1 blue
with 2 aces that enhance to legend at 99 lol
dude i farmed like 6 red legends already
and theres some spirits for crafting legends that never show up
does the selection ever get bigger. i see pretty much the same ~10 legends
real cheese is those spirit board legends
so i can roll up to gyms 15 levels overtuned
and farm them in the early game
dude all i want to do is find those high level wilds
these are truly dark times
christina made me get her sword and now i cant do world of light
got too greedy by trying to burst into irelia w and was punished hard
qiyana had her fucking ankles broken
bruh
it was hella disappointing
i just wanted avacaods
and were out but still had all their 9$ popcorn bags and shit
that advertised 10 for 1 avacados
scam of the century was this roadside fruit stall
saved then
ah nice
rough. like black friday shift
thats early wtf
is jett still here
coming in was clear tho
like 2 feet of powder
the mountains on the way out were super snowy
its amazing
i dont think it stopped from when i arrived to when i left
also it rained so fucking hard in norcal
man claps tho
pretty leftover runes
50k hp 180spd
runed ritesh hes actually kinda goo
Insane 
Lmao yea. 4k for reroll
I cheesed the legendary with crit chance
It's fucking hard tho
And aces in all colors
I got wario legendary
no wonder i do like 2% and take 40
with like level 36 2* ones
ok turns out you arent supposed to be hunting legendary spirits
literally threw my switch over that bs
is shit
spirit board
smash is a shit game
Get this red tint wildfire b.s. Out
You ask me it's the regular inferno vfx that gives me cancer
Idk man the vfx are calming and chill
All the new bushes blinding me
But I can still run it back
My team isn't with me
I low-key may still go. Dinner isn't until 3 so I can make a quick run down
She got issues
RN t
But Annie's like not even home t(n
We had this family thing of anyways going to the zoo on Thanksgiving to see the animals
I wanted to go to the zoo
Bruh
Why's it dark as fuck
Oh damn it's 10 nvm
I woke up early but was gonna go back
Why are you up anyway it's like dawn 
Idk I think I'll get 1 swc for talia 
Christmas pack always has a trans scroll tho
You right
Idk I think it's usually the 15th to the 25th
That pack expired tho and won't be back for a month
Bc even if I get a nat5 I need to skill their ass lol
Idk. I was gonna get the legendary and devilmon pack 
New pack is 6 runes 4 grinds and 2 elemental legends btw
Perna tiana hathor talia
or 2 swc ones
should i get the new pack
so if i drop 80 on sw for as like a thanksgiving present to myself
is insane
10 ammo to poke with rifle
also aphelios has some shit numbers
is cool
stardew patch
by going to atk% 2
on all of them
also the stats are scuffed looking cause hes gaining like 350 atk
and too thin
hes too fast
no its for 1 shen
that loses 8cd tho
theres an inbetween 84 spd 92cr version
or +90 78cr
+72 98cr lushen
lucky
dinner is boring as fuck
i want to get away from thanksgiving
also sucks theres no time this week when everyones free
i just want to go home and play league and shit
also tru
ok there joe rogan
has issues
gwyn
yea its probably you lol
wtf is that tho
is there a browser game worth playing
when they can just auto attack and maybe win
which is hilarious considering 99% of wind pandas use their s2 then die
hes actually usually squishy enough to die to daphnis
hes weak as fuck to loren/verde combo
hes not an issue when i run normal mons
panda cant cleave
or summon a fucking odin
gotta run the kahli cov cleave into that aids
didnt matter
banned lushen and got 3 swept
1v4
wind panda fucked me up
after winning 6 yesterday
so like i lost 7 rta matches in a row today
kms
im stuck in animation class for hours
riot OMEGALUL
so whod ban him
yea but he doesnt stream
lmao tarzaned banned right after winning
hopefully she keeps the passive on towers shit and can still 2 shot them
sucks tho. i liked my splitpush assassin build
nashors/zhonya instead of ludens/deathcap
now she looks like she wont be able to threaten one shots as often so shes more hybrid than assassin
i think it was pretty big for her to have more uptime
yea idk how i feel about that
cause you just waited on e
before a typical mage/assassin ult came back up
before her pre 6 sucked but after 6 you could all in for kills 2-3 times
it sucks now that she has to wait for r cd to all in tho
its just ori ult with delayed damage lol
pog ult
who tf is in that scribblio
into leaving
im pretty sure his plan was to tilt me
dumbass wind panda user sees daphnis alive 4 turns after he used hellfire -&gt; C A L M M I N D
slapper man
+1528 atk, +112 spd, 80cr 202cd
you should see my shimi hes so thick rn
if i had a psama id be rolling
its not too big
nah usually with shimi garo in the draft
thats the big weakness
or draco and try to outspeed
usually they ban bastet
i call it the 4v2 comp
also fuck real cleave i just do draco bastet kahli cov daphnis
damn my cleave kinda nuts tho
i gotta work but i want to procrastinate an hour
also do you wanna play a game or two of league
okay ish
thatd be like 
if it was like 1-5% based on the phse
Oh shit. And raki avaris
just need to get a set on julie
i think my runes are fine to cleave close to c1
max roll
g3 runes xd
and hes got like 400 atk 15spd and 15cr on me
my sets are almost all legends and grinded
dude idk what fucking runes that guy from the video is running
so lushen has to be able to slap without atk buff
theres nobody leaving bastet lushen both up
im assuming if lushen gets through its cause they banned bastet
but draco can roll cr buff
40 on neutral element lol
idk if itll kill
yea but if theres only lushen shimi or smth
atk is too low tho
+1500 atk, +107spd, 93cr 222cd
committing to speed gives cr but 8.8k isnt that much damage
idk if im in love with this lushen set tho
yea its just bad for those games where it comes down to a 2v1 or smth with bastet draco vs their last unit
lushen only 74cr but 10k on crit
shimi needs a few grinds but hes solid
squish
rn my draco is weak
im trying to set up my cleave yea
no its for rta
they deserve the win
and like if theyre cutting me with will runes
to not get cut
cause zaiross is fast enough
i settled on like +93
210 never gets cut after bastet only
I feel like 80 gets cut a lot
+114 8.8k lushen or +80 10k
t1 is a homunculus
and also anele
tfblade is resident sleeper
teams
i hate the 2 leading teama
Who else is doing well
Damn wtf
so its hella squishy
but its  flat hp on 6
the thing is also that my bernard set is +191
yea hes actually still super good
its over for the bern
yea. fuck bernard hes going back to storage now
but its only 4
also i thought whistle was down to 3 turn cd
only had 1 aquila extra
im a prophet
draco on 12
and there we go
scams
first 10
kinda sucks
tbh the fact he has no mobility or self peel
and hopefully not a nat 5
1 minute then 2500 stones for draco
get in melee of their adc and kill them in a second
but also if youre 1v1 it probably shreds
it definitely seems like the one meant for offhand primarily
pistol is quick cause q wastes shost
thats 50 throw and catches
yea but how tf do you ever get rid of the chakram lol
also 50 shots seems like a lot before swapping
Rifle/cannon is pretty nuts
Cannon R into Q is like a budget neeko R
needing to catch it is so gay
still not sure how the fuck youre supposed to play with the boomerang
but its really hard to get the max possible from his kit
hes like invoker where you can be a retard and use his abilities suboptimally and do ok
but can still tag them with it using the rifle passive
and he has like cannon now in OH
turret remains and tags someone with rifle
rifle oh
i mean you have interactions like boomerang mh
his kit is so fucking complex
Aphelios is invoker but adc
i popped off on ryze
ik
1 more league game?
game?
Good call. League is better
although olaf in f1 is such a killjoy
idk how she never did
i need to make christina watch it
like little sebastian
its ok theyre up in horsey heaven
jett killed the donkeys with that 1
you were asleep
i figured there should just be some kind of penalty for terrible perception tho
wasting time in cities
i mean i think its just culling stuff like the bear
yea its cool
like in a tv show lmao
then suddenly you arrived
in favor of making you guys have in character conversations for like 10 minutes
i prepped a lot for the road but it didnt seem important so i was going to cut that
yea
or like 1/4 idk
should i target 2 or 3 for a hook
btw do you think session pacing is too fast or slow
its ez
but like if you have junior credits
now is late for positions next summer. usually january they start opening for fall
call out sick whenever xd
get a salary
you should find some internship with your degree
thats lame as fuck
are you getting double for black friday
agreed
terrible play
extended shift scuffed tho
aight
you wanna play league in an hour?
Meet us at the theater or need a ride
i hate this so much
3 weeks to upgrade 1 level of the ancient sword
claude gay af
no claude is the worst
edelgard route best route
this fucking guy sucks
i dont even like edgy dimitri
is so damn slow
BL act 2
scuffed. doomed
wtf do i even do with that
2 swift runes double roll spd and then 1 into acc
you know what sucks actually
are jett and mars into it
whats the campaign past intros
so i have to pick 1 to gem
unfortunately no innate spd or atk%
11 cr
oh also a swift 5 with 25 cd lol
and a grind
just need a cd gem
atk% with 15spd 12cr 4cd 4acc
i finally got a good swift 6
lol
stellar endorsement of campaign
like a 1 on 1 intro rn would kill me
ik but rn i dont feel like rping for 3 hours
think im gonna play 3h actually
i still feel like itd be weird
should i join campaign
on streams
it looks not bad
should i get sword
thats chillin
i think they applied my a list discount or credit or some shit so
ticket was only 8 instead of 15 for some reason
i got you c12 for 1045
Yea fs
Just gotta get to my pc
I'll let you know then
We're getting it in a hot minute
1045 am amc7
Yea it's still got seats
1045
We're going tomorrow morning 
Also do you wanna see frozen 2
You told me that earlier xd
Lmao
You didn't have to specify in dnd
Ik
Nice
I'm heading home. How is campaign
Xd
Or sleep and go night hiking with me 
Stop being crippled
With no violence
I just don't want to rp 3 hrs
True. He's got jett miles mars
If you decide to too hmu and we can do smth
Ngl I think I'm skipping out
A lot
You have to interact
You know parsas thing is all rp
Reeee
Century city
With my parents xd
You wanna come to din tai fung 
and are you awake rn. gonna go to 3rd for dinner join up
yo did you eat yet
help
this is more aids than i thought
best known for his skill in stabbing whales
seal-clubber t'chanu
racist to eskimos
i could make a really racist eskimo guy
lmao
or dwarven barbarians called the anklebiters
i was gonna say we can be a pair of angery gnomes
whatd you change to
you wanna play tft?
This is it so far
Maybe dark cat can give me cancer outside toa
Yea he's 50
I think it's 50
And 15% atk bar boost on 2
Eshir is getting 20% damage per buff stripped and 100% proc rate
But eshir jultan water wolf have potential
Idk what cats will do
Fuck
New 2a werewolves and martial cat 
yo
and put in the email address
then hit forgot username
but you have to change region to public beta
it takes you to the recovery page
did you try cant sign in on the pbe laucher directly
and live password
its not the same as your live username
did you get on
and log in again
when it prompts you hit sign out
go to the pbe client
yea dont do that
so i think theyre unlinked in the database
once you sign in you have to convert the league of legends account to a riot account
its good
but when i sign out and in
like its trying to sign me into my live account when i open pbe launcher
ig
you just have to sign out first
wtf
no it let me sign in
hold on
it says i already have a pbe account
if you can reapply
im going on their site to see
??
&quot;pbe is not available for your current account&quot;
im gonna try
Are you even sure itâ€™s the right email then
Did you try reset password
Iâ€™m almost on Iâ€™ll try in a sec
Aight. Gonna cook with Christina so probably busy until 10 anyway
Aight. Gonna cook with Christina so probably busy until 10 anyway
Fuck animation. Left early
aight fs
i dont wanna cut into your sleep if youre getting up 6am
when do you have to wake
i dont get home until like 1030-11 tho which is reee
and how cool the rain is during water map
i think it is. ppl are talking about it
yea i was gonna say i wanted to play some pbe
pbe season
more like
preseason
this looks sick
yea im working on what to say
idk
tell mars?
you can make me admin and ill kick tho
also again you have to add me to the group
lmao
i didnt block him i left him on read
but he sucks for campaign
well yea im not gonna stop being friends with him
I think you actually made gestalt so you can add remove people
Yea gimme 30 to finish lunch
Mars wants to manage so itâ€™ll be on him
Yea weâ€™re getting out of the city
After he chills out
We can bring him as an npc after a while and see if heâ€™s better
Yea. I thought you guys wanted reset anyway tho?
I donâ€™t really know what to tell Parsa tho 
I think quickly is best
Lemme finish lunch and fix group chat
Idk how to interpret that
Well it's a start
ala letho
did he say hed participate more
aight thats good
if only cause of the schedule
yea im pretty sure he will
jett?
aight
unless you did
ill ask mars about this 
op op
i got like a 60 spd triple hp set
lol no
or is it not worth without meditate skills
should i 6 ritesh 
ye ok
and also maybe pushing start back so jett can be there
but really its just will he be open to removing parsa and participating more
yea i mean theres context thats important
theres no way he misses it
its a pretty simple yes/no question
typical
lmao 
but ive been using my dimension energy to 2a wind fairy
i would build a kro for gb10
and 1/100 nb10
never db10
i fail gb10 like 1/15
also how is your db10 less safe than giants
loren's real identity is dragon knight
in the yd video
did you see loren 1v1 verad
cause dragon is a bitch
i fuck with it
alright alright
oh hell yea
yea
and talk about setting, characters, motivations, etc
if this is the solution we go with we should get a group chat going again
its ok
same
but ik what you mean
that sentence sent me on a journey
i like this solution
i feel better about this now though
if theres someone you think is good though im not opposed to adding them anyway and if that fails we remove them no harm done
i think its fine
but say someone cant make it which is kinda usual. are we still ok with 3 then
jett and miles can participate more since theyll both be there and parsa isnt overcasting
ok so optimal solution:
4 pcs, start at 830-9 and contribute equally
idk
or wait arent we starting 7 bc of parsa
3 good contributors for half then jett comes in is fine imo
we wont need another
we should come back to this. if miles is open to participating more
yea
and talk slice of life stuff
her rpg groups are like the ones where they do character art
oh ik. i really want her in she just has refused every time
any other people you think would work
i can ask her. im down for it too i just know miles isnt big on it
yea ik. she just really wants more character interaction type dnd
cause idk anyone else we havent asked. id like to add christina but she likes more character focused rpgs
first tho we need to see if miles is going to participate more without parsa
instead of just trying to judge them on dms like mars was
so we can have them make a character first
its definitely easier to screen tho if we have a party tone and shit
depends. kevin is maybe the chillest player we know
and say no fuck that
should we put the random thing to a vote or just make a call rn
also get his opinion on the random
hes gonna answer you sooner imo
but will miles want to stay without parsa
alright. i think thats a fair statement
if we feel 1 is better
or add one later
but maybe we try 1 random at the start and can remove them if it doesnt work
im actually down ish for that
and half-jett half-miles
the thing is if we kick him were down to you and mars 
he just needs to learn to stfu
like wtf
idk why they even show then
would be chillin
like that amount of talking
fair. honestly if miles just played like he did with letho
not saying shit to him
i deadass just right clicked his dms to mark as read
aight. did you 2 tell parsa this
and ill look out for it
like if you feel cut off then say it
yea. i think we should be calling people out more
yea p much
and make it public
that theyd have shared
and take a portion of it
that theyre committed to
but right. everyone needs to write smth this time
miles told everyone his actually
jett never wrote anything
noxalas wasnt shit
were there
penny and lucia
lmao
nobody wrote shit
afaik miles only said he wants to dungeon delve and get stronger
or miles
literally tho i still dont know what parsa wants
and have at least some way that everyone can get their thoughts out and considered
i think the solution is to both have everyone aligned similarly but with different side quests
yea ik but mars and i also agreed that it wouldve been if the deck didnt skip a lot of campaign
pretty often
derailed
dereailed 
but also cheqir and yew
yea that was fine cause you could center the plot
because theres no agreement beforehand
super dysfuctional
its deadass always like that though
thats just a different way of saying they dont want to be part of the story or world
not stuff just generally in the world
i think the big problem is people only picked up on their specific lines
its really hard to make the antagonist antagonistic when nobody picks up on shit
yea that was a particularly tilting thing too
but if he didnt talk then its fine
so i thought of putting it in the chat and leaving again
i told him how it was gonna go when i was ranting
ye
did he spoil gestalt
mars has good points
ye
maybe. idk shit about their platform really tho
<ss type="confused">:/</ss>
so im down to roblox vmware amazon
ok. didnt get the wish position
yea thats good
i thought you had a spd db10 already
thats good speed
slap that dragon down too
1v1 queen
good monster
Absolutely abhorrent
Gross
That's so long
That's so long
How fucking long do you work lol
How fucking long do you work lol
You should talk to him. He's got his own points to make too 
I feel like I made that point already. Maybe to Mars
Like &quot;i spend my week making a grove &quot;&quot;
It was that there was very little of it in the chat and a lot of shit I couldn't work with
I don't mind it all in the chat honestly
That's an improvement
Ic
Spam
What slam
Instead of one line woven through 5 points
Ik I'm just tired rn. It's like writing 5 lines and tying them together constantly
And it really isn't much to ask that a party be cooperative
I've told them to change how they communicate with each other but it didn't work
Maybe but I'm tired of being the one coordinating everyone and relaying all the thoughts
Or relay party into
But then after the call I get talked to individually and constantly have to relay opinions
Like it was super effective when we were there talking how to make combat better
And improvements
Bc I want you all to sort it out and talk expectations
Yea. That's why I'm not really thinking about hooks and details rn
I'm also super tired since I slept 3 am woke 8
Honestly just shows tho I was right about 3 people care. 2 just coast and go along with it
Parsa sent me a fuck ton of messages I haven't checked
I ran a few other ideas by
You can talk it with him and see
I need like a few days or smth
He said run the one I want to run an rn that's nothing 
After that we'll make it a vote or smth where to start
Nah mars gave some good advice. I'm just taking a break until some core problems get sorted out 
actually tho mars pointed out thinking of stuff is useless cause we dont know if people are open to changing the stuff that regularly dooms us
then story takes place in silverpine/the feywild and includes delving forgotten shrines and shit ig
the mentors know he is the reigning lord of the fey in the area and his internal turmoil must be the cause, so you must track him down
since he left, the weather is violent and the elves grow dark and violent. humans without magic can do little to defend themselves and so cower in fear
where your mentors have sent you to track glorfindel
mars and i also thought of a hook better tied to old gestalt
Dragons in that campaign or others tho
You have to exploit their arrogance and pride
Facing a dragon should be like facing a master wizard who can also squish you like a bug 
Also dragons make great bosses. They're hugely cunning and have superhuman intellect so their lairs make sick dungeons
Or focused on killing this chosen dragonborn
Well do you want it to be more focused on like saving people as you gather them and push north
Or an aboleth that slowly enslaved a horde of gnolls and now wants to slave the humans with its army
Ig
It could just as easily be a necromancer and his army trying to resurrect the dragon corpse
And they want to claim him gravesite
The return of a god they thought was dead is the uniting force for this horde
Why not a dragon what. They're literally the gods of kobolds and dragonborn
with the theme of wanting to slay a dragon-to-be
really it should be more about saving towns, searching for artifacts to stop them, etc
but the red dragon hasnt fully emerged and so hes still mostly dragonborn
dragonborn, wyvern and lesser drake-like monsters
its fighting hordes of invading kobolds
well theres no real dragon
maybe even trying to slay the leader before he can become the dragon
the adventure is protecting towns from the horde, moving the populace northward, whatever good people would do
and so the hordes march north. kobolds and dragonborn of all colors, led by one who is slowly becoming a true dragon
his host has awoken, a dragonborn of particular strength and malice
that aspect of tiamat's soul has been slowly reforging itself for years and now it is ready. the fort and barriers on the waste lands where his children are imprisoned are weakened from the Assassin's actions
and so on the map the desert mountians are the bones of the greatest red dragon ever seen, and the last red dragon to plague the world
but chromatic spirits force themselves into suited dragonborn of their color upon recovering from a death
e.g. a gold dragon is slain then the gold dragonborn choose who becomes the next dragon
metallic dragonborn choose the most noble of their tribe to become the spirit's champion should the previous one fall
and so of all the dragon's children, the dragonborn are the greatest, having both intellect and strength
etc.
and when a dragon is slain, the soul reforms and seeks a new host. kobolds are the weakest of the children and unfit, too small minded and frail
the colors of dragons are different manifestations but there is only one for each color
the hook for the new place is that dragons are a manifestation of the dragon-spirit, the souls of slain bahamut and tiamat
just that it could somehow tie into daggercourt
i actually didnt think of what to do after the conclusion of saving this place
idk
getting in the world
saving towns and shit
getting established as capable people
and shit
but this level 1-5 stuff is like a lead up into working for nobles
we were all clear this is still ending up back in the city just as a base to operate from and not in
he can fuck off
you know what if that happens
after saving this area and ushering the people to safety
so if you guys do end up as proteges then youll want to return to your mentors
and thaeron is the closest &quot;safe&quot; area
and trying to better the world
its still part of the old campaign tho so theyll have heard the letter from morozov pleading for aid
i guess?
maybe gnolls or smth but i like kobolds
and so as adventurers youre trying to save villages and towns while getting out of the area
only the oculus's explosion has weakened wards throughout the land and the fort can no longer stand against the hordes beyond it
so like this map and you start near the bottom by the fort
so then when you arrive and join with morozov and them itll be scaled the same but fit better
i told mars about one idea where you start in a different part of the world where magic isnt as prevalent and work towards daggercourt having heard about the new magic and events there
you guys need to talk to each other and determine how itll go together and how to make sure everyones getting an equal input
So there's no sudden accusations of railroading or whatever
So there's no sudden accusations of railroading or whatever
I think everything can be solved if the players talk to each other and come up with their collective party and campaign tone 
High levels and more abilities to use
Idk I thought giving free reign would make people happy
And it's tilting that in a co-op it's not equal cooperation
And it's tilting that in a co-op it's not equal cooperation
And miles jett going along with the majority almost always
Yours and mars
The only voices I hear regularly are parsas opinion 50x
Never happens. I mean jett already said he just wants loot 
The core essence of people communicating and working together and having a unified party front
All the progress gone
Cause inevitably someone hates it and boom
So then I kind of felt like there's no point now in trying again
So when I was reading chat and seeing how it went I realized it's the same thing. Everyone rolled and Parsa still talks over and shit
So what I told mars is everyone has heard 123. Nobody's gonna fix it and talk to each other. I eventually come up with smth I want to do and we try again but then it collapses. Maybe 1 thing gets fixed at a time
or like fucking npcs have cold-ball as a 2nd level spell
and also looking up monsters and their abilities is really fucking lame. i should start adjusting them so like you look away from the basilik and it petrifies you
but people didnt read the world building stuff so they just make their own bg and shit to work with the best-stat race and expect me to work it in. worst case being like parsas character from some unnamed steppe conquered by the duke
it should be character idea &gt; race bonuses for things
also the power gaming/meta is kinda old
swapping is gay, dying is at least an interesting moment
3 is characters but that kinda ties to the first 2
also related to like why is parsa always trying to persuade the party and talking on other peoples turns
2 - cohesion, why the fuck is the whole party 5 voices. there should be cooperation and shit that goes into making a party
1 - investment, somehow people need to care and pay attention to story and shit so i dont have to push it on them
the whole thing boils down to next campaign needs to fix 3 major things
sure
shes not my favorite villain but she tied the world all together really well
but making a new one is pointless when the same problem of no investment remains
it was all planned and shit and involved all the backgrounds
because i liked the old one
so i kinda came to the realization i dont want to make a new story rn
and not bad
or like hes there half the time
jett cant be there so idk really
miles and parsa wont
so i talked to mars about it and even if he knows the issues and can recognize them
somehow you were the only one who was at least into their character enough to have introspection moments
and thats it
and their one arc
like people care about their character
and nobodys ever invested enough
also everyone expects different things from the story
so theres no story
or mars wants no railroading and then nobody picks up story hints
like parsa wants to do character arcs but we just did that
the major thing is i just want to run a story and every time someone complains about it
but like those are minor. yea i wish miles would interact more and parsa didnt just dominate all the conversations with his opinion but thats easy to fix we already know how
right so like we talked about smaller shit like metagaming and turns taking too long and shit right
Phone is gay
One sec I'll go type 
I already talked to Mars about the issues and idk where he's going next with them
Yea I was tilted af
dupe talia is still good but not as vital as securing first draco
draco is more important but a dupe one is useless
i cant decide if i want to fire or water summon
aight
either we cart cheese or build some houses for the dryad and nurse
i got iron from the crates
aight lets fucking kill a skeleton
traffic is the gayest of all shit
im back
I'm ready to fuck sans up
40 minutes. Leaving now
and theres good weapons in those chests
i mean you cant do wall of flesh without the hellfire stuff at least
handgun right
you have to do skeletron to get the keys for hell chests tho
also apparently this is the skeletron minecart strat. the world-spanning one is for the fish boss in hardmode
noice
i might go back to my apartment cause theres nothing to do here. if youre home terraria or smth
did you end up going to work
Yea wtf
Is that 3-11. Idk
Ew.  Which shift
And or food
Get the Mexicans and go hiking or smth
so do you wanna do smth tmrw if youre better
thats their whole company
exactly
yea why. who cares about not pokemon
cant hire enough ppl
legit jew compnay
its the same engine and shit
idk why they didnt just reuse that
and again the pokemon were scaled to size
they followed you in lg and you could ride them
hell no lets go was the best visuals of all
better walking
the sizes were scaled well
the lets go ones were better
tbh i just hate the new animations and models
thats strangely usual to pokemon
im definitely not until i finish 3h
i mean yea i didnt expect much
and whatever the fuck camping is
like how random encounters work
ig. story doesnt matter tho. pokemon games just need improvements on base mechanics
like a full version of lets go eevee
just give more pokemon
that you dont walk into
and no random grass pokemon
lul i actually like the 3d world
did you get it
ez
and be better tmrw
well keep doing that
dang. i was gonna suggest we hang with jerry or smth tmrw
if youre less sick we can hang tonight and get drinks or smth
with your friends

Also what do you want to play. I'm down for pretty much anything
Miss the kill but still have 2 turns to get them down
Anti revive is nice too now that it resets
Since he self def breaks
Deadass may go wind so he can one shot with just atk buff
Yea
He's so good. I used him in gw. S3 did 75k
I don't have the runes to cleave but at least I'll have the mons
Like g3 cleave uses bastet draco over tiana woonsa shan etc
He's the best atk bar boost for rta cleave
Next week
But I'm ready to do all my ancient coins on ss for draco
The only nat4s I'm missing are the good ones
But talia hngg
Ik. I have Melissa built and she works
Bae
Talia
Also should I get the 4 swc packs

like seara xd
and theyll update the ai
just need to wait for a skill change
teshar should have seara ai where he always uses s3 if its up
like brandia teshar
ik. they mostly do just not a few specific old ones
or its more like his ai is better and actually uses s3. hers is way fatter
especially s2
every ability is just better lol
spd scaling s1, branding s2, eruption s3
new fire homun is just better brandia
are nuts
good vlad one tricks tho
yea i agree. luckily a lot of tops are at least decent into him
his late game is nuts for sure. dont think he's SSS tier but at least A+
also 50k healing on vlad. balanced champ
which one
aight for sure
like anything. stardew, terraria, league, mc, idc
you wanna play smth

I had to beat it over his head but yea
So this one is gonna last
No he wanted a more stable long term one
That's hype
Yea
Last one
That's the most lit class I've ever seen
From the museum next to us
But with fossils
Bruh my next semester I take a history of the world class
Lol. Why no computer
There's too much shit to skill man
Exactly. I just want money for devilmon
Nah life slow af. Get me out
So I'm just gonna compile them all in a handout
Also I meant to give Lucia a vision with her rune but I didn't have it written
Never moves fast enough tho
Yea. Life be like that
They do virtual machines
Also Amazon but they haven't messaged back
Wish and vmware
Rn I'm in with two places I really like and idk who to even go for
Dude I hate job hunting so much
Yea
Pog
It's really big brained
with fran or smth as the banned unit
legit saw someones video on getting g1 with imesety verde loren raoq comp
i kinda like the f2p meta
and they pretty much win
legit i just try to get her verde loren into a 3v3
when hp is at -30 and atk is at +30 shes a god
yea she wins pretty much every 1v1
she does like 14k on a crit with atk buf/def break
basically just spd hp atk def
no crit or cd
im legit considering farming more fairies or devilmon her for s2 max
yea. mine is only like half grinded too
literally better than 90% of my nat5s. damn f2p meta
elucia shouldnt be a carry
this feels so wrong
they sniped my verde round 1 and bastet loren elucia still won cause nobody moved
literally won a 3v4 against an oke daph garo chow 
im like 6/6 today drafting bastet oke elucia verde daphnis aegit etc
milo ive become the cancer
Still have a gem and 2 grinds to go tho. Extra 20% ig
I feel like the hp is low
Got her maxed. 24k hp 1500 atk 1300def
woooo
just 11 more runs
90% there
nah its probably a few months away
for first day
i was thinking getting 3 sets today cause it comes with an extra d20
yea. i dig them all
dispel dice
very gul'dan
eldritch fire is the best one imo
those are my fav
yea ik. i want eldritch fire, dragonheart, verdant vines or whatever
and if praha fails s2 it takes an extra 4 rounds
she just keeps shielding and healing
4-8 minutes
8886
i want to die
also ive been doing fairy b5 for 8 hours
although my kahli scuffed cause i went for spd. theres plenty that could hit 45
yea i believe it
survived kahli
45k hp wind panda fucked me up
dude
ofc
my fucking hrungnir becomes hoh
and a lot of hp/atk/def ones
still missing i think 2 spd grinds
rn she's 240 vio+revenge spd hp atk
yea shes gonna be nuts
bruh i gave water fairy my deadass best set before she's even 2Ad
So if that somehow tracks I may move on still
The only thing I have going for me was I was recommended at Amazon 
Lmao ok
Yea
But if itâ€™s auto Iâ€™m fucked
If a human reads it theyâ€™d see Iâ€™m almost there
So thereâ€™s a chance but itâ€™s small
She also didnâ€™t finish that one
Itâ€™s fine. I just have everything riding on wish Wednesday or waiting until next semester
70 minutes
Needed like 10-15 minutes
Didnâ€™t finish 1 of 2 problems
Also I fucked Amazonâ€™s thing so hard
Ronald is alive and plays league. You should reinstall so we can int him
art history midterm tmrw
ye. im gonna just sleep
yea ik. god julie
if only i had the runes lol
with an insane carry
yea its an insane comp
also
i just want it over with
ik
these are mostly technical tho
ive been working on it
stress is gay
i want to kms
with so much on the line
i have amazon part 2 and wish part 2 this week
fair
yea fucking c2us 
bluestacks or nox
to get your json out
yea it sucks. you have to use an emulator now
2 months ago
so exporting is butt now
the tldr is com2us fucked everything
im ready to be so salty
with 2 of my worst nat5s as dupes available
FUCK YES DRACO SS 3 WEEKS
or better did you get ror yet
did you reinstall yet
Most of them are like +160
Better than 3/4 of my guild xd
nut
on the bright side my bernard +192
how the fuck are these people in college
but somehow 3 retards who did it right in the first one used the wrong version in assignment 2
2 of them are the same person both times
both times ive had 5/28 submissions in python 2
dude we specified both assignments so far that students MUST use python 3.5+
so hes just barely faster than vanessa to strip into def break
yea. hes a respectable +133 vio/will
just gonna cycle turns for atk
also im doing this new thing with my aegir where hes all spd no atk
fast revengy boi
need 2 grinds so like 134
not bad
+126
i finally got my verde on vio revenge
wheres mine
thats fucking insane
aint shit but a fire chasun
feels pointless
nah i dont like watching summons
draco pls
i havent popped the legendary yet
yikes
finally
off world boss
legendary scroll
bruh
league?
The first one with usc. Not Jefferson
Science Center or smth
Usc
Yea. Like 2 blocks
btw are you free to butcher a pumpkin
sure. either in a down time week or in session. the academy might have something in their library or a bookseller 
so they dont think youre insane
with more detailed knowledge
you could wait to find a book or smth
except those already given away such as Glofindel's sword Anyeira or rilatar's staff Vilya
yea, every story agrees that the saints died there and left their sacred artifacts behind as they ascended
some stories say the corpse of Nilgesh himself is coiled around the mountain and others just think its giants or other monsters
its not like whats there is common knowledge. some myths say that its demons who want to prevent the return of the saints
or a private goal
depends on if lucia wants her crusade to be known
and its time for him to die
motherfuckin malphite has lived long enough
against a mountain
so you gotta wage holy war
but nobody has been able to go there because something kills all travelers 
and the most sacred shrine in all the world
the Azure Peak is supposedly where the saints sacrificed themselves
i have an idea
lol
theres internal heretics i guess
both <b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">technically</b> allies
the closest foreigners are the Duchy of Auren and the Jin Empire
also who does lucia want to crusade against
wut
to make it interesting
i mean there just has to be something
azir xerath can just get ap idk
you dragged it on too long anyway
if youre in a post 16 game and its not ranked who cares what happens
renekton/nasus get 1 more rank on r
make the ashe/liss/sej quest grant bonus slow
let diana/leona gain armor or smth
post 16 in non-ranked is lame anywa
yea ik. they should make way more
i think also souls
if she kills him after theyre both 16
senna steals threshs souls
one of them always gets the thicc nuke off
yea thats why the optimal speed team is lushen double talia sabrina
she just needs them under half
melissa needs 5 debuffs
shes straight up better melissa
if i could even see the +3 id know already
its a waste of time
that suck at 6
im sick of keeping blue runes
exactly
and i think its fucking great
like b10 can drop anywhere from +0 to +15
also somone suggested dungeons now drop powered up runes
to sate the rainbowmon
yea ive fed more grim reapers than anything else
theyre both so insane
idk what i could pick either
its impossible
like i legit could not pick between the 2
trying to make the choice
then i kill myself
or tiana perna
could be clara gargoyle
very true
but this is fun
thats the logical choice
if i drop money its gonna be on the devilmon pack tho
xd
31% chance talia
.333 * .935 = ~.31
1/9
so your odds of a dupe nat 5 are only 7/63
oh no its 6.5%
swc is 5.5% i think
1/3
so my odds of a dupe are also
i have 21
also i learned theres 63 non ld nat5
it wont happen
nah 
2/6
1/3
ik i highrolled already so its unlikely but
for talia
i kinda want to get a swc pack
and sell the shit rolls
then power all up to 9
same. i farm up to 700
to make 6* every week
yea. idk how some people have so many runes
so like every 2-3 weeks
my process involves farming until i get enough 3<b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*"> rainbowmon to make 20 4</b>
yea. the nuts thing is tho some people do 1 6* a week
efficiency
then just farm him with 2* until 40 max
so the process is 6*-&gt;level 3 4<b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*"> to 30 with him, level 2 more + 2</b> in slot 4
cause i always end up with a trillion 3* rainbowmon
like just get the 4* to max
yea. i usually use my newest 6* to farm food for the next one
he doesnt need insane cd
ive seen guardian garo with like 140-150
everyone has faimon on auto farm now i guess
like for new players its insane
full 6* rares
but its a damn good set
apparently it comes with lapis or smth
2 of those runs were upgrades form e
even sadder
lmao
is just his old one
the vamp set they gave for free
yea. hes nuts
insane player
and im pretty farmed
his laika is deadass better than mine
that man got thicc runes
did you see durand's new laika set
the slot 1 is a decent rune
her stats are aight
whats her stats
thats fucking nuts
also the surfer sabrina is faster
his 2nd hits all at once instead of one by one
is dj lushen
the real speed up
its so minor tho
i like how my teams look
yea theyre good
fucking game
got a brownie magician. just not draco
I dont think it's worth it
Sabrina doesn't even scale super hard with skills 
Yea but if they do it'll be the wind ones
No wtf
hes in my area so if you want you could come here
oh yea
for some reason unity only builds android games directly to an attached android phone
yea but you can build ios apps to an emulator
mines scuffed
christinas is nice
and old
its like cracked to hell
terrible
and i got one from the school to test on
the game im building rn is for android only
s c u f f e d
so not day lol
well we're gonna be going back like 10
if you wanna butcher them with us
christina and I were gonna grab pumpkins on the way to sm on thursday
rip. are you doing anything for halloween
league?
yo
vio on both right
true
or just s3
is that w sabrina hit
insane unit
is nuts
yea deadass her s3
yea put them on vamp for levelling
wtf
mine is just saying temporary error
also is your gmail down rn
and wipes it
yea she just moves right before boss
like most i see are 20-30 spd
yea i think talia goes last
its pretty sick
globally
isnt it heal and damage
its not a shield what
btw did you see sennas kit
no xiao lin
yea but now what lol
dont feed unique nat 4s thats how you end up without a xiao lin
well theyre sending you a message
or like set a default system font
are you sure the menu didnt just moe
im sure theres a way
get used to being a human
good
lmao really
in the first place
why do you read demon
thats the dumbest shit ive ever read
every attack is a 600%+ multiplier
yea twins are fucking insane
id probably hit it with racuni olivia copper
cause it looks like it
i wanna know how many people see that 2nd defense and think its ez copper
tell your guildies to hit me
idk how that happened
i mean my bastet is 16 acc
if he werent 5* no skills
khmun ritesh praha sounds kinda dank
hes shit
i actually unruned my avaris
you know thats khmun right
only 162 spd tho
hes like 31k hp 1700 atk 900 def
idk the 3rd there
+ bastet?
i could do like khmun wind monkey
should i switch him for daphnis
does eshir have enough hits to kill laika tho
my laika is like 75% resist
oof buddy thats rough
my khmun slaps tho right
like 1-2 down or none
how far did you get on them
just to bait copper
ik one is fucking elad jeanne theo but with a double def elad
wait isnt my def super troll
LMAO get fucke
Pog
And one time devilmon from 2a a mon 
Patch also made every Friday and Saturday all elements day
gemi is pleased, having gained ~25 new converts and strengthening the belief of many more
so there will be a source of manual labor in time
so in some time there will be a full blown village outside the estate, for now just a barebones camp
also the way ive been generating results is deadass rolling a check or two with advantage right. double nat 20 on religion and persuasion for the week. Lucia not only sways hundreds back to peace from rebellion and gathers good will towards the church. but also convinces about 100 or so people to move outside the estate to start a village there since their homes burned down
Aight. Peace
They put out a cinematic
But maybe it's coming soon
I thought there'd be more 2a by now
If only
Just dies 
Mine no defense
Until someone with Dias shows up
I'm sick oof waiting in raid kicking no res lead randoms
That's all
He needs a resist leader
Pixie and her reset lul 
True Chad darion
Should've been vagabond
Pixie is shit
Man I want more 2a already
i just dont really know what id use him for
im gonna make a kro
after elucia
kro too
sig only moves twice
but kro straight slaps artamiel
the runes are kinda bad too
with kro
did you see the toah 80 artamiel cleave
yea that sucks
value
you could yea. but that taor s3 buff
waste of animation time
galleon useless
if you have the damage
you can even swap kahli for lushen
its still fine. trash waves go a little slower but not significant imo
verde twins raoq kahli
lmao
level fodder in slot 5
if you dont care about time
with like a galleon for extra safety
can 3 man giants
also lushen talia sabrina
gotta play the vio cancer meta until then
so no point yet
but like no draco
it should be for me too cause i want to cleave rta
and its still solid
its still ood cause you can gem on ~8 + grind
so even if it rerolls like cr cd atk with no spd
yea. the good thing is swift can be a nuker set too
purple swift is where its at
the odds for 2 in spd is 1/16
legend swift is a bait imo
id reapp that all day until at least 16 spd
i deadass still have no hp% legend swift runes
reroll it until its good
that hurts
but thats niche
i run zaiross for resets on revives
yea thats the ideal
so theres no atk buff
cause your team is like tyron jeanne twins mav/spectra/whatver
also makes her better for toa
you dont have atk buff up there very often
its so good for dungeons
you do have a talia
hoh and toa faster
db10 faster. nb10 faster
and ld
instant sss fire/water rift
than any of those nat5
actually tho sabrina probably helps you more
ARGEN lul
well thats still a good result
yeet
meh
i should write an essay but
also are you looking to play leagu
mine is like 2:30 but only 85%
what is your team for that
its awful
shit takes 5 minutes a run
super pay 2 win bastet praha monkey lmao
i finally found a water fairy 2a b5 team
Ree 
YAS AGAIN
Dead backwards
That windwall sucked ass
And just afk
They should put him on like ashe
Like he's only good on kaisa
Nuclear also sucks
But yea also their style too 
I meant the song lol
Every match
They need to not play kda
Vs kaisa smurf
Soloq yas
B_n k_sa
Teddy played craven too 
Skt 
Varus was played 
Not yasuo
Find a third adc
They should just think rn
Wtf
Just gave up inhib tower
They couldn't first pick both
Yea Idk. They should've at least taken one
Qiyana
They're banning like
Lee sucks into them
I mean ban kaisa ryze then
But scales
Is as good
I think Elise or olaf or smth
You can't really get far enough ahead on him
True. Also idk why canyon keeps playing Lee
Kaisa sweeps otherwise
Exhaust fucked him
Yas did aight in that herald fight tho
Weird drafts 
Yorick doing nothing too 
Jesus
Yas adc is so shit
Actually potentially usable in rta now
And I love it
I think the biggest buff was praha
It's really close
Btw are you watching worlds 
Resist oblivion
And make teshar ai good
I want more sekhmet buffs
Vamp Lord is at least better pve
Vero too 
Taor buff sucks
No the Rica buff is huge
I think the other 2 were better and got bigger buffs
Charlotte buff is weird 
Gotta cleave her with full will or a Julie to avoid nemesis
She became a whole lot scarier on ad tho
It's not like she'd be too good
Ik. Why didn't they just buff her strip too 
insane
50% chance but still
WTF PRAHA AOE SLEEPS
nice
justice ignores damage reduction
vamp lord buff is now 3 turns
tho i think charlotte still sucks
also all the OGs
they buffed Vero
well you called it
oh also i forgot to get back to you last week. i was gonna say lucia spent the week testing into the academy, becoming a Novice pending a 200gp payment. also gaining access to novice courses and services
for clowns
clown votes
and reddit thought they would go to finals lmao
fnc got fucked up
also FNC LUL
legit
rolled 91 on concordance
cause lautrec begged for intervention
actually everything went nuts
maybe
a normal cleric on holy ground is pretty unstoppable
anyway idk what parsa was thinking. even if she willingly accepted judgement what could happen
but he has the folens operate the church instead
the official head of church is rilatar elin
if you look at church role shes actually appointed
parsas character still wants the archbishop to fall
everyone but penny is a fanatic to their own sect
she just doesnt want the power to fall out of her hands because the next archbishop will likely be unable to keep the city from utter destruction like she has
she openly accepted the judgement of the Divine Miracle and even then Carius intervened to spare her so in the eyes of the gods shes still good
the archbishop is in a grey area
the archbishop or her daughter
to nobodys surprise the party was evil enough to just be ok with her shit and took the reward from her
also syvani has an army of enthralled slaves
and so the conspiracy is that the Archbishop knows but refuses to let her face public justice, instead hoping to deal with her privately
but imperfect, built of ruined flesh instead of celestial fire
but she has one now, Omega, in the form of the archangel, Seraph
but her experiments mostly failed and her artificial celestials inevitably went insane and murdered people
until Fina sent one to Lautrec when he found his congregation crippled and doomed in the Citadel
syvani was moving slaves right but she would secretly keep some and carved Ancient Words from the era of the Saints into them in order to try to create celestials which hadnt been seen in the world since the Calamity
did you read the tldr for session
do you have risk of rain
pog ass 22 spd vio rune
you wanna play league for an hour
Also I love daphnis so much. I was gonna get a skin but they're both so good
So dodges and armor cuck mana gen 
Just need it so now mana is gained by damage dealt
Should've always been four 
Three rows is dumb
Next season has way more potential I think
And fantasy
Seems more natural
I like the elements over race
Super iconic ult
Yea she's the perfect tft champ
youre right
its like a new game
i read it all
What's new 
Nah
idk what to pick
with daphnis or woosa
pulling through
swc scroll
YOOOOOOOOOOOOO
so lets play league to solidify that feeling
ive been doing practice coding all day and want to die
ah nice
you back?
gay vro
yo league
and the swift one to oke
so i was thinking. should i move my fast vio set to loren
he still kills the panda
and with no def break/atk buf
cause if the other 2 die hes at 5 stacks
hes a weirdly good wind panda counter too
into wind defenses
yea i like to run him with chloe
is value as fuck
also bs5 during free energy hour
idk what they went for
im hoping to join their AWS team or machine learning
kinda lol
it might just mean being seperated from christina for a year if they make her go to seattle
yea. if not ik wish pays a fuckton
just gotta hope that their postings are still open
holding out for amazon because ik their exams are easy and i got the answers to their round 3 interview
i got referrals to wish, gusto, and amazon
im getting 5 EU scrolls
if i get a job offer before the swc pack expires tho
yea i guess
until they buff him
yea. that or just leave his ass in storage
give him that chandra s1
lmao i was thinking like despair ritesh
life is pain
i have literally 0 violent runes that are free and good for ritesh
lul
Yo are you free like 7
Also for the academy and elementals there's a novice class, an adept one, and an expert class. Lucia can spend her week trying to test into the academy
Christina and I are gonna see the new maleficent at 930 if you wanna come. Otherwise we can drop by and chill a bit after
Yea sure. Probably later in the day
aight
you wanna come over after you eat then
thats fine we made food
idk when are you free
emily had some shit come up so connor couldnt go camping so that died
you wanna come by later and do summons with christina and hang a little
or when i hear back from a job
idk i was gonna do it after camping or smt
didnt do it yet
its time
4ld 3 legendary
2 water and fire
8 wind
104 mystics
league
wings are aight
bruh i want that chimera mog
jett and diego are in tft so we can aram rq
also do you wanna play league
Btw parsa can't do next week so we're doing main session this week. Ik you have the other one but everyone else can so idk I feel obligated to. Anyway. Open invitation. Whichever you choose is chill
gen
led
of
aue
leg
aue
leg?
for 6s off each run
imagine doing all this
xd
im still missing that one
lucky you
15 minutes
in a bit?
aight
league?
its just so dank that you run lvl 1 3* into r5
hes the hardest to build in the team tho
but he was hoh and looks like should be an option for anniversary hoh
when i want to raid/gw
i only have 1 imesety so im shifting his set around
yea. but thats cause imesety
than like anyone else over the years
then again this man has done more damage to the r5 boss today
im salty i only have the f2p emperor
as far as wind panda counters go
its like rina 2.0
and gets insane stacks off him
ignores his defense
he tanks him
yea ik thats what im saying
cause rn i have to float 2 of lushens runes over
after i skill oke ill do bale
1750 230cd is actually doable
each % is basically 1cd
up to 30% increase on s3
yea but you can just skill up tbh
im at +1750 250cd barely hitting the 30k minimum
with both of those you only need +1600 and 230cd
cause no atk towers maxed or skillups
i had to go really far over the &quot;minimum&quot; bale stats tho
its nuts
and theres a channel dedicated to finding teammates so that hasnt been bad either
yea. i only failed twice cause someone didnt build the right team
rip crystals
38s runs
bs 5 is  legi
damn
?
you want to see the joker film 
fran 5* is unusable
oh yea you should
by tanking him and yoinking hp every time he calm minds
like he counters wind panda
but honestly you probably use him enough that its worth
you can. he just gets tankier at 6
sick pull
exactly
i want one just cause hes a support who doesnt need vio or despair
fuck thats cool tho
thematic as fuck
thats sick actually
damn pog
Good enough lol
Is it good cd
They only need 70cr and bale awakens into 30
That's a bale/kat rune then
Last 12 hours of rta
Even bad rolls is nuts
Damn that's sick
So Iâ€™m safe
Also I nearly caved and got a xp boost but thereâ€™s an event on the 6th giving one
As like a celebration of campaign lasting until then xd
As like a celebration of campaign lasting until then xd
After my paycheck covers all the costs of shit I got over the summer Iâ€™ll get you a pack or smth
Ez nat5
Iâ€™ll get you a prem and let Christina summon it lol
You have any big occasions coming up 
Someone confirmed it activated the nat 4 blessing
Cause no blessing pop. Itâ€™s just a free upgrade to a summoned nat4
It doesnâ€™t replace a mat 5 tho
Gz 
good svae
oh fuck
?
like the noble heir as an npc
and run it again with a few tweaks to make it better
i actually like the setting tho so if or when its over i was gonna get anyone who can and wants to and find a random or two to fill out the party
as much as possible until we cant anymore
i dont want to but we always have personal stuff come up but i want to go as long as possible 
also what i meant to say about stopping in a month or two is like thats what i expect from the party
for any of those classes you can go with academy trained or thieves guild or smth
aight. think about it on the way
im good with anything you want to make
any ideas?
yea. i think remaking is a good thing. can align better with the party
yea it was an unlucky set up
and joins the church full time
can just be cant handle the job
doesnt have to be died
again you can just alternate weeks
so im just not doing that now
but i also cant be the one wrangling people forever
i do want this to last as long as possible
you can remake
every time we do campaign you get bored in like 5 sessions
you or miles or mars drop randomly
jett cant make it half the time
i mean you knew this was coming
but like that was expected. i just need to finish the setting building 
since this is falling apart anyway
i was gonna stop and find randoms after that
alternate weeks for a month or two
or just alternate weeks
fuck them you can smoke weed any other day of the week
im still mad no draco
Literally just runes everything swift. But itâ€™s insane swift sets
Literally just runes everything swift. But itâ€™s insane swift sets
So that g3 cleave person did an ama on reddit and showed runes and shit
welcome to the new age
the real secret was kro
it really do be that way huh
true. usually has def break/glance/unrecoverable too
but shield is nice anyway except that shes a turn hog
panda can solo anyway
lmao yea
?
+1200 def xd
so i dont need delphoi on that team with her
turns out double def bastet can actually 2 man front
r5
this is a game changer
i swapped my kona and delphoi so that the immunity doesnt double up
which only needs blue runes to get
yea. 90% of supporty mons will work with ~100 spd vio sets
like my tyron had a 5* slot 6 with 11spd
even 5*
blue vios can still be usable
idk. ive found some good runes from seemingly shit ones
good for twins
no spd
keep some with cr atk or cd
maybe your standards are too high
and i REALLY want gemini
i also missed gemini
they offered him twice and i missed him both times
and nobody has res lead
running with randoms is shit cause they take forever or you need to paus a sec
if you only get 1 reward
you should at least be able to place all 3 teams
even when you total 80%
gets you no extra reward
5
i hate how running 2 teams in r4
is an insant win
slow and reduction
yea its pretty busted in db10
got def
its not great or bad
659
no wait its cr 5
5
and res
16 spd 17 acc
but idk if i should go for hp def or atk
oke slot 3 has a flat hp i can gem off
My tesa has none and does fine
Idk vero and Theo do the same with or wiithout
Maybe teshar 
Fucking vero was the biggest skill up waste
it was already wasted
the 150 set was on louise 
which is insane with leo on the map to slow them
cause oke and monkey both get full bar after stuns
with leo oke monkey + stripper
actually i have a sick team idea
 fuck that kid
i want them back
no i used them on leo
but so unskilled
my oke is so sick
god im so mad i dont have devils
taor is old brain ai
usually with garo
i use the raoq verde duo a lot
yea
all the stupid jeanne ones especially
99% of the time a defense is copper bulldozer
like i just see which of my decks is closest to optimal and pray
so idk how to play off just picking a counter team
yea. tbh tho for gw i always use one of my deck teams
yea hes gotta be used somewhere
nah i need more atk buff + boost mons
i just want his s3 to boost attack bar
buff vamp lord
and his s1 is ass
vero s2 is ass
also just easier to skill
tetra is new meta cleanser
fuck vero
no wonder nobody uses vero
thought it was just one
also i just realized her passive cleanses a turn off ALL harmful effects that arent stun/freeze/sleep
nepthys counter pog
hmm tetra cleanses silence too
lmao insane synergy
quality of life change
pog
oh yea
good change
that youre done
now
it like tells you no
oh yea
yea but her passive is just a better veromos one
but the heal is nice and clutch cleanse/shield
really just the provoke cleanse 
niche
shes super nice but counters the shit out of jeanne
and then finally cleansed with s2
i just watched a monkey have a giana bomb on him 5 turns in a row cause she kept extending it
dude water mermaid extends bomb time every time she moves lmao
same. thats the kind of shit most guilds have
its not cringe so its in the top 10% already
thats good actually
whats your guild called
joker is a real gamer
you know about the auto target zaiross change right
pog
uses 3rd skill
not 15
lmao no shes actually 5 ac
and she still landed def break every time
back before her passive gave acc
my shaina is like 15acc
theres no way its that high
boss
yea. 36% should have like 70% chance of landing on a 60 res bos
whats his damage stats
you dont really need him to tho
unlucky
nice. gb still kinda sucks imo but the siege and tartarus rewards are great
fat rewards
good shit
youre on siege and shit yea
oh good. full guild perks is big
its not a mexican one again right
sick
so i might just cave and buy a xp booster
but a lot of other shit
and theres no exp boost in it
also the next event is the guild missions
thats as good as it gets without twins and insane runes
usually everyones gonna move twice after her
although she works going last
its not an insane amount but its a decent set
Otherwise if the boss wipes everyone else in her invin she wonâ€™t kill
Khali good but she needs like 35k on s2
He could work. Probably well
As raoq
Thatâ€™s almost the same thing
Next
I need to fuse like 40 ninjas
Yea ik. Could always 2a another raoq tho lol
Yea thatâ€™s why monsters with passives are way better
Same with everyone except seara
Suzano mad tank
Still cleaves
Thatâ€™s not bad actually
Lmao. Not despair?
Sick. Thatâ€™s a big milestone
even though theres legit no point for me to with shi hou and aegir and shit
i kinda want to just run this shit to c2-3
im pretty sure this guys runes arent stupidly better than mine
yea sure
if you get an A/S
its such fat rewards
yea. look for one that actually does lab
did you join a guild yet
i cant ever buy one again
yea ive let so many time out
it feels stupid to buy one
no but they give so many for free
but i need an exp booster
im still working on my oke and bale
thats pretty sick
yea by a lot
is your kro 6
easy
loren will make it
if its not safe
and it takes waaaay too many unknowns
so i just farm 2<b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*"> into 3</b> now
i always end up with like 80 3* rainbowmon
also thats why i buy all 2* from the shop lol
thats a good order
but its consistent
its slow and you have to go left-&gt;right-&gt;boss
new team is verde fran loren
twins doesnt do it anymore
hes a fucking legend lol
this guy clears db10 in like 14 minutes lmao
this is sick
apparently i shouldve got a texture pack
you progress really fast for not that much each day
aight. deadass tho do guild shit
each week
is farm for the legendary magic boxes
the real big brain play
if youre insecure
or legendary pieces
buy water scrolls then
is just so much shit
+ lab
also siege rewards
hope for shaina to solve the def break problem
and buy scrolls
for like 2k gp a week
and siege
you should just do guild stuff
your taor shouldnt have any acc tho lol
seems untrustworthy
wtf theres no way
or 40 and you need 25
boss only has like 25% resist
thats like everyones weakness tho
only lose should be galleon resisted, raoq resisted, kro resisted
Skills wise
Which one do you have
That order optimizes def break chance before taor moves
You shouldn't need atk buff. Just def break 
Ideal
Galleon-&gt;raoq-&gt;kro-&gt;taor
True. Maybe it's a turn order problem
Nah mine lives unless it's enraged
So she can kill through immunity 
Ooh you could swap galleon for kahlu
Boss might move
Nah she doesn't push back enough
But never fails
Slightly slower
Switch gally for Loren 
But that's just kro
With eruption
Nah that sucks. If anything the fire one
Pray 
And pay
Put your team on full vio
When in doubt
90 at max skill
80%
I think kro is 100%
Aren't you running kro raoq
The fuck
Dude I straight up know nobody who wants to build the spd r5
Yikes working at night
I'm ten minutes from home
Damn it do be like that
I want to play now
You can't say that to me before I'm home
No talia
No kaz
Dude idk. No third lushen. No fire ball
The extra thicc
I'm still waiting on lushen 3
Cause he's less mitigation than fire panda
Oh yea he's great. You need tankier back line tho
I want a second on vio tho
Yea vamp 
For raid
Really it's probably the single best skill on a tank
Also it heals him
Cause passive lol
Yea so he gets to use it more
Well if she's no atk buff
Same as a brandia s3
55k with brand 
But god damn does it slap raid boss
It's not that op pvp
Which also slaps the boss
Meant to be spilt like skogul rock
Yea his s3 is like 2400%
For the bale solo he just needs 30k+ on last hit no brand 
Like you need a 60k kat 
But that needs better runes
You can use jamire in kb5
All free units
All free units
Nah
Fair. We need extra fat runes anyway cause no atk towers
And run it with me
Yea. I need 2 others to build the same team tho
time to level and 5* them all
kaz done
I need
You have ld nat 4
Fuck you 
Yea. I think she's aight for speeding up necro and toah
Next set is for deva then oldie
Next set is for deva then oldie
They're all on twins
No vio damage runes left lol
Fuck it
Yea. But I got nothing else to build so
And I somehow never summoned another
I think I can but that's a waste
And my boy needs 30 mid and then 15 more
Cause water hall slow as fuck
Yea. Kaz is straight up a bitch to fuse
So hopefully I can just dip 
I finished my part of the project tho
Ah. I have a meeting till 4 so I'm just gonna grind sw during
What. Like metaphorically or literally 
Scuffed
For fall?
So you have to apply in spring
Yea that's rough. You switched a ton
Ik you were at like 9 units or some shit lol
Can't you just take it at the same time
Damn rough
Oof I thought you already did
When do you hear back
Next fall or this spring
When are you transferring
At least you get to work with him a while 
I mean you should but
That's pretty cool
Is he working with you now
Degenerates
I do so many scrolls
I'm still salty I have the worst nat5s
Pog. He has so much potential
also i didnt realize you have to hit collect on the 2000 day reward
yea its fat. i just need to float a rune between bale and lushen1
the set may even be too good cause hes at 100cr when you only need 70
is like +1600atk 240cd
but the set on cov who has crit awaken and 10 less base atk
need to fuse kaz then him 
so im gonna do the bs5
so i realized i can build a fat fucking balegyr
thats not bad
damn nice
wanna league
you done farming?
theyre on my friends list in a game and level 31 so i assume its someone we know just getting back into the game
we know fatkidonascooter right
free af
raoq lushen homun
i just three man the sds now
im gonna
farm it
pog
get that kro
hell yea
also all dungeons are open rn
is my theory
when you buy premiums
the game gives you less
so like if that keeps up my next one is adupe
but also my last 4 nat 5s have yielded 2 dupes
so theres a good nat 5 chance
i think itll be around 100 mysticals and the 2 ld from toa + 50 pieces and then 2 legendary + 100 pieces
even without packs
for sure. there should be like ~50 mysticals
might even just buy prems on toa day
fed some 4* for legendary pieces
all drops and events
30 total from daily between now and next toa
gonna get that 2000 day pack for 20 scrolls
ive been inspired so save up
yea no its fucking insane
No counter besides just running no will rune monsters
Strip
Damage
Atk bar boost 
118 base speed
He's nuts 
Woonsa cleaves fucking everything
This bitch is like a c2 rta account already
Aight. YEA WHAT THE FUCK 
I want to learn ashe
You home yet
cause thats the only way to sink the elemental ones
and using the pure crystals for reapps/loot
someone gave me the dank idea of fusing homunculus for food
ALSO
nah embrace your karen side
And don't eat inside
I feel like that's the kind of place you get drunk at the bar at
Oof. That's the only thing I liked lol
But that's hard to fuck up
The soup ok
True. It's just bread soup and chicken with no utensils
Did your grandma like the violence
But he won in spirit 
Too cool to win
He does clap some cheeks tho
Unlucky
The edgy one never wins
me too. the melee is pretty brutal
and people beating each other with metal sticks
grannies just want to see violence
true
annie got 2 and the scarf last time
youll get a flower or smth
lmao. pretend youre a girl
what knight are you sitting under
itll creep her out
tell her happy birthday for me
damn. sounds fun
league?
i can do like 1 league game tho
nah im playing fe
i guess i can do campaign stuff
gay
i got time for a little
league?
I need like 100+k to be happy
This is chump pay
Yea but I just need a job
Yea but I just need a job
Cause the daily packs are just way too much value
I really just need 35/15 days
Maybe 10
Hey that's 2 weeks. 8 hours
That's a lot of packs
So the school pays me 750 every 2 weeks
Time
Now is mature tone
Nah I fucked enough in high school
Damn millennials
Just talk about where they want to live and shit
Like &quot;what are you long term goals and how are you two working at it&quot;
Idk. If you phrase it right that's fine
Against all logic it seems like it
Wait ok. Is she happy with him 
I haven't talked to him besides at your place for months
Well that's still fine. The big thing for me is it's stressful as fuck hanging with Diego
Is he transferring with you
Actually what's miles trying to do anyway 
No matter what feminism accomplishes
That's a front. 99% of girls won't date a guy that makes less
No girl wants to be the carry in the relationship
But he's fucked if he doesn't get it together
I can't say anything to him I haven't already
But like Diego wtf
Idk. Even then I wouldn't but that's not too bad
That's not a livable wage man
She said she's content making 60k or some shit
And the government takes over half of large inheritance
You spend like 20 million over a lifetime
I mean same but that never lasts
But I'm legit worried for them. Mostly Diego and gwyn 
I can't they think I'm rubbing it in
Like everyone's stagnating and it's worrying 
Nobody's trying to hit a big career or anything
Yea you're good but idk about everyone else
This is like the optimal time in life to make it big
At least you're trying for Berkeley
It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion
And his only goal is uniqlo and weed 
He's got a gf now to take care of and shit
Idk but he didn't need them before
Talking to him
Like it's just kind of sad
Idk. He's got no ambitions now
Idk him now
Legit tho. Dig changed
Also Danish
Eh. I don't like hanging with dig now. I feel like he's just awkward now
That kid is unredeemably awful
Fuck danish dumb ass
Also. Fuck you do campaign
So I'm not too open to cleave
Most go vio but I go swift
Also cause I'd pick her every siege battle honestly 
I was straight gonna build a second on vio
She's new chasun imo. All purpose support
Ooh have you built Fran
He's low-key S tier
Also cause he gets garo lead
Is thicc
Atk bar and immunity
But I'd take the draco in a second
I too have multiple acquila
Very meta right now
Bastet draco cleave
And I badly need one
I realized I've never summoned draco
Looks like it. Usually last weekend of the month is all dungeons tho
No lows?
Oof. How far off are you
Plus he gives speed lead to imesety
And he's built with 50 spd
He's like 37k no defense break
Mine. SLAPS
Yea he's cool. Ramahan too 
Sets up a 2v3 AND she 1v1 almost every monster
Strip and def break in one skill
And makes gw stupid easy
Do a Loren actually. She's god tier all dungeons
Unless you do toah. Then no homun
Kro and homun imo
They don't really outperform him either 
Also 2a kro exists
Yea but twins suck PvP now
She still slaps giant
Also I thought you have wind chak
Also I thought you have wind chak
So 52 scrolls a month. Then with the events and drops I should be 100-150 a month + 2ld and ls from toa
15 ms over 15 days and 750 crystals
You need like 150 ms on average. So my new plan is get the daily 2 pack
Yea that's the statistical outcome
i really want them wings
and if i win im set
to avoid decaying before season ends
i think the play is to play one on the 28th
1 loss and im doomed
its so risky tho imo
so im in the grey range of safe
but the cutoff last season was 1561 and it goes higher every time
c1
do i push higher or just hope the bar doesnt go above
season ends oct 5
7.8%
ok so im 1572 rta rn
still no iris
got light sylphid off monthly scroll
but i need more fire vagabonds
yea shes nuts
could use harmonia too idk
or fedora
i was considering building her
discount giana really
f2p strip+stun
like he does it regularly. also this was c1 so idk
but it clearly works cause this guy snap picked them
oh yea its not good
roughly 80%
its like 3x 40%
anyway
but clara strips and stuns
yea idk i kinda fucked up picking into it. didnt draft double immunity cause i thought he was like f1
lands all the stuns every turn
full will despair
this fucker drafts tyron shimi poseidon clara and some gay shit i banned
and im salty af
i got poseidon cleaved in rta
i think its worth
its pretty sick
and dk
dice mag
also sea emp 
yea lol
to make it worth
time to farm akha and elsharion
me buy ifrit skin
stable connection unstable hands
league attempt 3
lets go
aight
finishing eating
yea. 10 minutes
life is pain
i just suck now
i have consitent league ping
You wanna get tofuya before campaign
Just doesn't fit the aesthetic
It's actually cool
Bruh that smc building is actually done
Yea. Hype
And then their tenets are just be like the saints
Yea. You should read it. It's the churches official history
Especially church and thieves guild
Yea. Everyone else has a good bit of background
Idk enough so that's been slow
Except lautrec
And lore about everyone's backgrounds
Plus I made some more relevant ones like a properties for sale list 
Yea it's easier for you cause it's slow and not all at once lol
But it'll be sick cause all the city lore will be there day 1
And likely villains
And your characters will be npcs
Ik most will leave but Parsa mars probably won't so they can guide the randoms
Is when we finish this I want to re use it
The real reason I write all that
But like
I might start giving inspiration for reading
I wrote a stupid amount for campaign these last 2 weeks
I'll figure him out. He's also nuts ao
Cause you can't draft Vanessa first 
He's hard to use rta
Yea
Just niche
He's good tho
For the blessing 
I fed that one
6600
I literally burned all my crystals today
Diana 
Hathor
Gany
Tiana 
Nah. I was hoping sears
My vamp sets are butt to. They all have speed
I'll find some
Hmm. Fair point
For 10% reduction tho
For 10% reduction tho
Lul
Acc
Also wtf
I can grind 6 res to attack on one rune eventually
should i go more attack
30khp 1550atk 1kdef 77cr 185cd 60res 0acc
Yea. He's cooler
Yea. He's cooler
Both wind
Who
Wtf
For a dupe laika
5 premium packs
Value
Fat 
But 1% speed was more value somehow
I could've got 4% atk hp def
14-&gt;15 for 2040
It's cheaper than the atk one
The crazy thing is
Finally maxed speed totem 
Three years
Damn. Iâ€™m still 10 out
Iâ€™ll be good in like 15 actually. Hmu before you start next
Iâ€™ll be good in like 15 actually. Hmu before you start next
Maybe in like an hour
I need to walk home and finish an essay and shit
Yea exactly. Plus I only did 6 ish so 17 is still triple time 
Just canâ€™t do much cause last week I couldnâ€™t work until Monday and the week is thurs-wed
I did add on 3 hours so Iâ€™m at 17 for this week tho
its my first one so if they audit it ill look clean and theyll never check again
and just lie all the others
nah im gonna be honest this cycle
so like theres some wack juju balance going on that i want to maintain
besides that one birthday pack where i summoned it all away
id say it can fund sw but i havent been under 5k crystals for 4 months and havent bought shit
idk thats so suss tho
i feel like i should just do it
i asked this other cp how many hours he worked and he just said &quot;5 but i bill 20&quot;
lets fuckin do it
sure
yes
league?
until you try pvp in any way
i feel like its such a dank idea
did you watch yds sw permadeath video
yea its pretty fucking taxing
and now i cant go back and delete it
yea. i was kinda retarded at the start and uploaded a bunch of pngs
music files are multiple mb
but like jpgs are ~100kb
so i get 3gb for 5 a month
well they upped the limits apparently
and it wouldnt count towards your r20 upload limit
well before you could upload to the other thing
or upload your own
now its just a few small ones
the biggest supplier of music on r20 shut down
february
so now sounds are just doomed
yea. they got rid of almost all the music on r20
thought so
is it too edgy to record voice lines through a modulator for dnd
storage guardian
buff this man
but now twins exist
isilen used to be necro god
just missing fei
thats actually my ideal cleave
any 2 of those dd can output that
nobody in rta is over 35k hp
nah you just rune them swift
like you do 2 boosters + fei reno lushen
rta theyre squishy enough to where shes a must ban
then she sweeps the last 1-2
and a kona/teon on swift to get him to go first
for regular arena you use her with a slow fat lushen
the way she works is as a cleaner imo
anyone else they just ban your lushen and youre stuck tryna cleave into full will with 2 non ignore def
over your lushen
spd lead + ignore def is enough to make them ban her
you need fei to draft a non tiana cleave comp
fei is god tier idk wtf you mean
those are like at least decent
hrung and grego
i have 2 non hoh ld nat4
or iris
dark boom
couldve been
kms
ld lightning for dark elf ranger
I'll just avoid him
Maybe for a bit. Christina is doing art
Are you all hanging out tonight
fire sniper hoh is pretty lit
will i regret feeding away my last fire bbk
does it help build the setting or is that all built through session
btw how much of the handouts do you read. does it help with the setting or is it just a waste of time
same
he said i could int his game
you wanna play league with me and jett
ik i said every other week but this is the last one i have decent free time
btw are you good for friday
xd
1v1 rta i changed my diamond skills to there
not sure if thats whats making me bad or not playing for a while
anyway my ping is stable just circulates between 60 and 120
those people are bitches
and my runes are pretty ass. some people on reddit have like 30khp 1500atk aegirs with 230 spd on vio will its nuts
devilmoned him hes so good
fucking nutty monster
ik. also i built aegir
i can play league again lit
where you at
fire monkey is bullshit. some dude has his runed 40k hp and i lost 3 siege battles into it
set him as my rep
ngl monkey looks sick with wings
idk why mog packs are limited time
same tbh
hes got 3
which mog
hes not
verde? monkey? bastet? too many choices not enough wings
one for sure vanessa but idk who the second should go on 
all the rta i did i can only afford 2 wings
you know what else is hella scuffed tho
now hes like 20 so its ok
it was worse when my verde was only ~5 spd over galleon
and even more if he violents
you lose a lot of effeciency on the first atkbar buff
s c u f f e d
except galleon goes second
mine is literally the opposite order
should be galleon-&gt;tarq/raoq-&gt;taor-&gt;verde
my turn order hella scuffed tho
wait
thats my team
should work
whats the full team
if you cant speed it down she lets you go face without risk
dragon never moves and the immunity doesnt mean shit
deadass loren is 10/10 for db10
its turn instead of total speed passed
especially cause verde comps make the scaling kick in really quick
its all bruisers so even fran or loren chip damage is good
people dont really draft mega tanks in rta
she puts def break on shit so its like 4-5k
her dmg isnt that bad
also her slot 4 is only 11 spd xd
missing 2 spd grinds and skill ups
mine is scuffed too
insane monster. i used her with raoq verde a lot
or strip and def break and 40%
and def break
slow + 60% atkbar reduction every hit
she just makes one of their monsters afk
built her yesterday and climbed 150 points today
the real carry tbh
Wiiiiiiings
and its godlike
over time it went from 3 max to 3 min
bruh fusions with the new mid drops
It's huge
It went from 14k xp total to 22k
You see it
That new xp buff tho
Also that's unlucky. Are you just raoq farming or exp too 
When do you ever have more than 2 debuff tho
It gives immunity now tho
It gives immunity now tho
If lulu ever gets 2a she's gonna be busted
True. That's energy positive farming
Only 25 and 14 minutes to do it
Still slaps giant and dragon tho
It's only floor 4 lol
should i devilmon brandia
does miles live near you
tell jett that he needs a name that isnt TEMP NAME
ironic that it wouldve been better scuffed
it was hard but now dbm yells at you what to do
before when mechanics were secret and you couldnt google them
now
i think they didnt which is why its so easy bow
like rn its just too accessible
take down all the wikis and shit too
and made people have a .1% chance to dc at all times
i think they shouldnt have allowed addons
yea it turns out clasic isnt that hard
it was out since start
rag downed too
downed in 6 days from launch with half a raid under 60
fucking ragnaros is a meme too
the speed clear records are a meme now
good prediction
the dankest timeline
after shit talking marc merril on twitter
oh shit did you see dom got banned during his 24h stream
that would be nuts
like leo
how much dmg
whats the water demon s2 after revive
stupid balanced game
but you offset that with the consumable that gives 1 movement and the 2 range staff
she'd only be missing good speed
and innately anti armor
she would have anti cav, anti fly, warp, and a ranged heal
her white spells are the good ones. if only she got physic or fortify
lul
how. she trains reason and faith
although ive never had anyone get to A authority
probably both cause its more stats than even the A authority battalions
or they forgot a negative sign
is because theyre meant to be
is literally perfect on byleth
the reason edelgards supreme armor co
you know what i realized
who has one
its great
yea. ive got 25res and 30 def so nothing hurts
last few battles i just threw byleth in and let them int on her
i think so. im trying not to tho
its getting slower for some reason
i played 3 hours of fe and only got 1 chapter further
and just not tell him
yea. we can mob parsas place too tho
but youre coming here tomorrow anyway
nah i put it outside before i went to sleep
ill just summon one ez
if i ever get sick of r5
yea hes nuts
i thought it just disappeared
i didnt realize the wind and fire s2 healed you for the hp you steal from teammates
do you like the water one s2 or wind/fire
theyre all sick af cause of that s1
and i really want one
i saw yd using mephisto
yea lol. i even saw a reddit post about 4 damage dealer r5 teams
especially the shield
she really is perfect
the rejects from team 1
the patchwork team
im kinda salty team 2 shows higher contribution tho lol
same honestly
my second team has a shitty delphoi and swift fran
pretty much. they may have actually overnerfed r5
2 minutes at worst and i only need to find one competent teammate
my second raid team works now
bastet changed everything
bruh
y/n<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1567363547186" ts="1567363547" t="61"></e_m>
y/n<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1567363547186" ts="1567363547" t="61"></e_m>
make bastet 5spd faster but fran loses 5 spd
wait so are you going treasure hunting first for money or trying to help and recruit peasants/artisans
amazing
gross
thats a great last name tho
ew jeremy
fuck jeffs
you could name your enemy jeff

you mean like tanner
what
i think it is a real last name
that is actually a really bitch name
fucking /lorenz/
great. thats exactly what i need
or at least a major force in the city
i just want to be able to work them in as an actual player in the race for the throne
then kicked you out or smth
or maybe hes a really powerful noble and bought the position of bishop before you could be promoted
or they bought your parents store and made you homeless
like they ran you over with a carriage which left you injured for weeks type shit
give them some real antagonist shit tho
worst
the fucking
i heard that guy is the worst
znerol
and maybe one hated enemy
yea 2-4 of each
aight sick
jealous zealots etc
bad exes
like a priest she worked with and liked
thats good. just work in some friends and enemies within the city and yea
i like that story actually
ah i see
idk what that is
you also have a list of some contacts though
so thats the current state of the house
yee
also if you catch one gold fish its like 4 of them
you get fat exp during the fistfuls of fish day thing
at no exploration point cost
free professor points
the estate i mean
i moved you to the picture so you can see it larger
besides the handful of farmers
and the land is good but nobody works it anymore 
yep. youll have to purchase the mines to work them again
the family mines were bought out, most of the land has been overgrown
you have your butler, few servants, and a scribe
just the house itself is intact
most of the estate is in ruins
thats about it
on your land you have some farmers
explore manners
aight cool. im trying to guage where people want to go first
buying establishments like a tavern or shop etc
but recruiting farmers or buying a mine or smth can raise income
but basically the house starts out at negative income
yea understandable so i just made a handout
under the handout of your estate it lists people currently on your land and the money theyre costing or generating
aight. you know how followers/artisans work yea
to try and get enough to buy an establishment and start making monthly bank
mars plan was to first rob someone for money
ye. so do you have an idea what youd do first in campaign
and when you arent the weather is foul
the coolest cleric one is while youre healthy the weather is good on your lands
also every class has their own demense effects
no wonder arthas lost at light's hope
yea it sounds fucking impossible to take a cleric on holy ground
theyll be classed to others
but as you build temples, towers, establishment
so its classed to whatever jett is bc he technically owns it
well the stronghold is rn just a keep right
those are the 3 options
All enemies within 30 feet must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects
of the contagion spell.
â€¢ Shafts of golden light stab down from the sky,
penetrating walls and ceilings. The beams
target all undead, demons, and devils within
60 feet of you, even those hidden or invisible.
Targets must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or be annihilated.
â€¢ You and all allies in the stronghold recover all
Hit Dice and gain 30 temporary hit points
but theyre broken af
you just cant use the same one twice
for some reason the cleric lair actions have no cd
ngl tho the cleric lair actions are insane
i need to know what class the keep is going to count as a stronghold for
did you and jett decide on class/domain
Peace
Yea this was a fucking fiesta
My fucking sauce deadass dropped on the call button
Oops
In the future
Yea sadly
Ooh for sure
Hell I eat it straight up
I mean I do like it on both
It sounds like drugs
Wtffff
Or shrooms
Purple haze isn't weed
Wait hol up
But yea. She thinks I've only smoked weed
Which I pretty much was anyway
She's making me be clean now
Christina would kill me
I really do
I do
The best vegetable ever
Is 10/10
Also arugula on pasta
It's ok I forgive you
Yea ik and you did
I was talking about Parsa

Behold.  Raoq awakened
That's mostly what I'm using
The stronghold rules and artisans
Hmm. Look at it and see if it's understandable. I don't want it too complex for our group
Wdyt of the stronghold book
jett volunteered
but the maps took long af so i havent yet
same. i was gonna rewrite the letter to start with ruin has come to our family
xd
the nato reference on allies and darkest dungeon letter
Did you get the sheet and handout
It's very fitting
Laptop
Aight. When I'm on my lotto
I'll fix that rq
There should be one called known runes
They all should be
Yea group
Nice. Well lmk. I gotta go to class rn
You see the runes handout
As long as you change his war outfit back
He's great
I'm almost halfway through lions
Not bad
Should get the others to name the house the Eagles 
Is this worm three houses 
check out the handouts. i think youll like it lol
Well at least now he can't escape jail l prison
Crazy
Saves money
That's ok they're criminals 
None Tbh
Name one reason minors shouldn't face full jail sentences
If the retard police weren't too scared to jail minors we wouldn't be here
Idk why they aren't
Minors should be able to be imprisoned
Nobody wanted to do anything
Idk I did when he was stalking sasha
Same. Everyone saw it coming but he never got asylumed 
Fucking mondev
Yea ik
Idk she's pretty shit for toah bosses now
Gets bonus accuracy instead which is lame 
No attack bar decrease
They nerfed shaina tho
Homunculus cost decreases
Wind and light are easier
Also elemental rifts are only two stages
Fuck them anyway
You can't kat cheese it but like
The r5 change nerfs it so much
Yea exactly
Instead of 2-4 mid it's 3 tll-5
Hype
Magic essence increased drops
R5 boss only jumps once at 50
And you can say target miniboss
They removed stage two of rune b10
It's ok 
or i can make a new one
also idk if you can transfer gestalt learning
to their gods
and then minor churches ran by non-humans
im thinking a main church with its saints
yea but he had a ranger too
geralt
i dont remember mars ranger's name
braccus
vix
the saints are gemi
if i do a center churc
but idk i like the dnd gods
i cant think of a name besides seiros rn lol
like multiple small houses instead of one huge one
still unsure if i want to do a central church now or multiple to all the different gods
aight ill let you know
or let mars/miles/jett do it
do you want to be the noble son
work in progress tie in rn
The Duchy of Thaeron under the late duke Xavier Graves was known as the heart of the Etrudian Kingdom. Centered along the violent waters of the Divide, the capital city of Daggercourt commanded the Silvermoon Harbor, first and largest of the suitable ports along the river. To its north, the Silverpine forest provides fine lumber to build the sturdy ships able to sail the Divide; and to the west, the Emerald Vale provides a bounty of food and ore to feed the city. Within the capital the thrum of industry transforms beats the raw materials into all manner of goods that are then shipped down the Divide. Thaeron, and especially Daggercourt, grew wealthy and powerful from these shipments.

In the good times of old, the city ran with practiced efficiency. Xavier Graves tolerated no corruption under his rule and the dockmasters saw the construction of over a dozen ships every week, for none can ever make the return journey up the Divide. The noble houses were kept in check through heavy taxation and strict oversight while the commoners were appeased with government services and the opportunity to raise themselves up. 

Now, the marble city dangles on the edge of collapse. Killed in the night by a nail, the throne of Thaeron passed to the young Maxwell Graves. A boy of thirteen, Maxwell thinks only of vengeance and bows to the whim of his High Council in all other matters. Greed and corruption have clogged the gears of trade as more and more coin flows into the hands of noble houses. In the night, when mists from the boiling river blanket the city, a shadow war rages between houses. Though the vying for each otherâ€™s territory and wealth is nothing new between noble houses, a new development has surfaced. Through a dangerous and painful process, the Swellbinders channel the raw power of the Divide into an individual to awaken the Rune hidden within them. Using their Runes, noblemen now live double lives between day and night. 

Son, I find myself caught in this struggle and Iâ€™ve seen shadows in the mists at night. I know that the nature of my Rune has been leaked and they will soon come for me. You are the last hope of this house and I hope that you will come home soon to assume my position. I regret that our finances are in ruin and our artisans moved to House Lonato but I have left you our estate and the names of our old suppliers and allies. Return home, son, restore our house. But be careful who you trust with the secret of your house for there are those who will use you for your rune. 

aight time to die
so i cant really think
but again i havent slept well in 2 days
since everyone is going to remake backstories it makes more sense to have the others be mercs hired by this new lord
the edelgard you mean
so we can start right away with running your own house and trying to work up
so i was thinking alternatively that someone is the next heir of a small house after their father and older brothers are killed in the city chaos 
5 for any water is gross
false advertising
sue them
t r u e
smart choice
good
just leave
ew gross
so how did you get dragged to a charity thing
same
like shamir
always secondary authority if they only need one
yea i never solo focus a stat now
for free
authority on anyone is fat stats
i didnt. fuck the xp and stat cap increase
broken batallion
and cha
some crit
6prt 5res
+6mag
+7atk
0 damage from everything
i put edelgard's supreme armor co from last run onto byleth
easy game
mercedes heal
shamir ashe to snipe
lysithea to blow up bosses
rn i have sylvain dmitiri ingrid stabbing the shit out of people
hes kinda meh
yea i just benched him
wtf is that shit
yea ikr
lazy ho
yea her too
just being bitches about it
theyre all at b
im still waiting on her, ferd, and petra to ask to join
protect bernadetta
BwOwO
buuuuuhm
ominous noise
but the consequeces
im gonna add it fuck it
its so dank
but they forfeit all lands and rights when they do
and anyone can legally kill him
which is like a jester but his job is to flame nobles at dinner for the king
there's a kings wit in stormlight tho
i dont want to write jokes
thats not really an advisor tho
i need more that im sure im missing
im really tired from this canada shit
guildmasters
high mage
archbishop
lord marshall of the guard
also who would be on a dukes advisory council
only way to balance ng+
yea i want lunatic 3h
xd
get a life wtf
gonna s this bitch
and im already A with ingrid
im on chapter 8 of lions rn
oooof
hey sothis is my s support ok
like sothis but autistic
sosith
is it too meme to call the church the church of seiros
as usual
nepotism
but yea if someone is a minor noble its easy to rationalize why a house recruited them
lol not all nobles have one. roll a d20 xd
so i dont mind it
actually if one person is a very minor noble its a good tie in initially
and everyone can write in a few of their ties to the city
but when i have stuff ill post it
and figure how the church and all works
i need to write up some houses
yea you know how it be
but i like sorcerers for flavor
druid is fun cause you have so many options
p a l a d i n
its ok we all have that one class
ik you do
etc
or the church
or guilds
and to specific nobles they have grudges/allegiances with
just with slightly changed backstories to tie them into the city
but he also said everyone should make &quot;new characters&quot; that can be clones of the old ones from gestalt
im assuming michael still isnt
do we know if miles is in
i got dinner with parsa and we talked about campaign
r i p
now we know better
nah we had it planned tho
And not fly with them except that they operate 95% of floghts in and out and through canada
Ikr. Next time ok to book it through credit card
Fuck Canada too
Fucking air Canada 
Also I saw two blue lobsters
Xd Iâ€™m passionate. Debating making runes for those powers instead
Or Jett told you about the magic or smth
Or Jett told you about the magic or smth
Did you ever read mistborn
Never seen before xd 
Customizable npcs bless
Yea. Iâ€™m excited tho
Yea. I think it should be possible but punishing. You get the earlier boost of more lesser runes with the downside of needing to undergo removal
 If you canâ€™t though I feel like our group is powergamers enough to hold out on inscribingnuntil they have a greater
But if you can easily switch it then guarding the secret means nothing
Idk how to handle overriding runes cause I want them to be basically permanent. Like knowing a rune set identifies a noble
Inscribe
Otherwise farming babies is dark
And inherit obv 
Yea. Combat or the removal process may break it
I think I'm going with the system you can only get them by cutting them out of another but the process isn't guaranteed
Ik. I want more flavor ones anyway
True. I forgot destroy tho
Did you show jett runes
Poutine is life
Canada time
I'm at a park rn with Christina so like in a few hours
Yea I'll come up with more
Like vampire for taking on hordes
I like the greater because they give specific utility
Idk if I like the lesser runes rn as they're all stats
Yea. Those and will are rare tho. Not all runes of a tier are equally rare 
Those 2 stood out to me
Or revenge on a boss
Nemesis on tanks?
C'mon
I mean rune of violence
RN it's just sw clones
Cool. Also do you think I should stick with those runes or more out of combat ones
I have npcs to be met too so you can be with them
Yea on the road
You can take Evan too xd
No reason to switch unless people want to
First session is the road to daggercourt
It's the same world starting exactly where we stopped so
I was going to let everyone keep their characters
It's double duty. House lords and hired guns
We are legion.<context suggestionId="d5bfa0a9-5c9b-40b8-92f2-a939a1ef598f" impressionGuid="1B15EFE26AFA424B91A10AC10A1EB60F" serviceTag="69B8226F62E147519E910AE5AC87A59B" clientId="D62B3532C2DE4150803F89664827EB9E" serviceTraceId="DE2A773FCBB3410D9A1A7DB284C3091F" suggestionType="Reply" providerId="cortana"></context>
Corpses talk after all
Yea I agree. Murder invites retaliation so it has to be done subtly
Also ignore Parsa flame. It's usually over numbers which can be fixed
I was going to keep regular magic items too but obv not all of them can go into a ball so crests are the preferred of real nobles because many of them are also doubling as muscle as well
So nobody will start with them it'll be like magic items where you get them as you get stronger
So the plan is you join a house as mercenaries but imitate nobles at dinners and balls. At some point you'll get land and stuff to make it more believable too. But the party lives the double life of making deals and gathering Intel as well as carrying out jobs and stuff
Only then everyone could get one easily cause most enemies will have one or two. 
But making it a system where they only are created by births and need to be cut out for transference works too 
Otherwise all nobles would. I just picked losses only decently strong people could afford
I don't want it to be everyone has 3 so there needs to be some req for it
Also I might make less combat ones
I was thinking of using this system to make npcs and players more diverse and imitate crests. Wdyt
I'm here
We r gonna be there in 5.
im on the way down
Yea ok. I'll see you then
Or smth else 
What are you thinking for dinner. Ramen or burgers
Aight for sure
Aight. 430 or 5
Promenade or century mall
Ah ok. I'm down to eat early
What time are you doing dnd
Unless you're working
Dinner probably. I won't be there until 2-3
I have to drive down to sm in a bit
Lmao smart
Pretty much
Christina and I are going to Toronto
I can't play for a week or so tho cause I'm going to Canada
If I can get the other 6 is ok
I just hope Hubert and edel are the only ones who join her
I think if you go the others the monastery stays almost the same
But maybe it's cause edelgard route has no allies
Tbh tho I liked act one way more
Claude is gay af
I just don't like the deer 
I think I'm gonna go lions and save as many of the Eagles as I can
With hades or dark spikes
Later I had lythisea going in
It's broken for kill the commander levels
Idk when byleth killed him I had a spare option
With stride 
Almost all those fights I'd warp byleth in and rush the commander
Even Claude can be spared
Nobody has to die except dimitri
Everyone else I avoided in fights or spared
The only students I killed myself were Hilda and Dimitri 
Flayn had a fat aoe heal
I ended up sparing her anyway
I felt really betrayed when flayn left tho
Also I just didn't want to lose 2 of my best
I'm glad I did
I almost missed going with edelgard
Dragons need to be slain
Fuck them
The church is dragons 
Milo I would never side with non humans
I wish I had taken alois with me
I like to warp petra in 
He's only got 2
Caspar more mobile
I swear her crest procs more than mine
Actually edelgard is a great tank
And I hear sylvain is for dark Knight or dark bishop 
Mine ended up paladin
Ferd isn't heavy armor
His movement issues fix when he gets great knight
He's the best front line
You're still wrong about caspar
And you can't recruit sylvain free
Yea. The downside to lions is actually dedue
Dimitri goes from Chad to incel
Eagles are all ok
Lions only has ashe who's meh
Except lysithea and Hilda 
I don't like any of them
Did jett pick them or did you
She said so too 
Yea Christina is also deer 
She has no weak skills too 
Her only weakness is shit mag and luck
Her only weakness is shit mag and luck
She's fast and strong too 
And silver lance for mages
Horseslayer armorslayer luin
She &quot;counters &quot; by one shotting everything
No I mean is effective
So she counters everything but monsters
You use it to slap archers so they can't counter
It's called luin
I'll link it one sec
I'll link it one sec
Otherwise she slaps with the relic lance from her event with dorothea
Was she didn't have high enough authority to get a battalion
My only problem with Ingrid 
10 damage &gt; battalion
His passive is nuts
His base speed dex str are insane
Tbh Felix is a better pure sword than mc
AT least arcane crystal is endless
I think it's only monster loot or battles that give ore 
So I left all my relic stuff alone
Yea I couldn't repair shit
Until near the end. Like with my support levels
Especially cause I didn't know about breaking monster armor for loot 
Like I never really used anything but silver weapons
Yea but the silver is more base damage
No durability 
The wo dao suck
Is it predetermined what you get each level up
Even though they're trying really hard to shoehorn you into swords
Also I might make mc a mage or smth this time
I was gonna use the extra battle to level all the people I get
Yea but that's not hard. You can dine infinitely
Then use all the extra time to bond and snipe bitches into my class
My plan for ng+ is buy max professor level
So those 2 are gonna be my recruits from deer
But you need Lorenz to get the event
There's a relic to double magic range
Hard
So after pulsing back to the beginning I set it all up
And if you one shot rhea all the church retreat
And if he dies nobody transforms
Until I realized if you warp and stride buff byleth they get to the first transform guy on turn one
The hardest fight was against Dmitry
Anyway I'm playing like classic
I didn't get it
The fuck
I can't. ng+ doesn't let you choose difficulty again
Also I sandbagged act 2 by not killing anyone
No I fucked it and chose casual so I just restarted when people died 
And Ingrid riding around with the horseslayer and two silver+ to snipe the back
I legit threw her frontline every fight with armor slayer
My petra was assassin
Dude shamir is great
I want to grab Mercedes and sylvain this time too so I went with the female
I need them they're so good
I took felix lysithea shamir and ingrid
Cause I can just use reknown to catch up on progress
But recruit everyone
I might do the edel route again
Yea ik. If only we could've fought the darkies
The dolls give 5 mythril
10 umbral
Loot 
I even broke her armor for the lot
Yea ik. 5 raging blows ez win
And Hubert is the ideal dark mage
Edels axe is busted
Nah the important part is edel and Hubert
Which is why I'd replay the route
For everyone
Although I only saw the C events
He also has cool support events
He's my only great knight
Caspar is cool
I got lysithea somehow and she nukes
But I also really like the Eagles because they're dysfunctional as fuck
I like the lions people. I recruited a lot of them on edelgard route
So it's hard to pick
I know edelgard always dies
But I'm at the decision screen 
Idk if I can side with the church
Ik fuck everything that isn't human
But I also kind of want to see the other stories but idk if I can handle it
And I forgot to do all the support events so I could do that
But I don't want to do another route because I can't kill edelgard
And now I want to ng +
I finished three houses 
Aight sounds good. I'm busier in summer anyway 
How many sessions do you think to wrap up. I'm thinking to just continue where you stop instead of restarting
how was the game
aight. after then
so you wanna do smth
sorely missed
rip macro
same
damn that used to be my same macro
mid
also i have the rest of today off. you wanna do smth irl or online
this shit is broken
true but this is beyond good
not having the res is kind of a blessing
warrior enchant sustains you infinitely and even without dd his ult keeps him constantly full
aatrox healing this patch is dummy strong
tons of shit for open world and travel
inside forest is more maps and theres a folder uploading called imgur maps with more too
bunch of loose maps then the assets folder are pngs that can be dragged into r20 with transparency
road assets and shit
yea but the blood or no
any + hit mods or no
is it still there when attuned
whats the curse on it
6
blessed be
did you hear certainlyT is off the champ creation team
she went with the one with edelgard
idk maps are nice for combat
or did you just not do maps
also last week did we fuck you by going left instead of right
but christina wants to play it first
actually 3 houses looks fun
ye
like mid teleport
and one shocked and the edges of his face phasing out
i think if it was evandar i wanted to do like one normal portrait
so i may redo it
ive been doing it monotone but i kinda want to go color
idk who it is yet i just started painting an elf
also you want to see my WIP painting of evandar/vix 
build them
most of them are nat 4 you could just
stella reset on s3
jesus this patch
shimi full strips and steals attack bar
also laika now takes 1 more hit to kill
my boy revives all allies now
MOTHERFUCKING ELADRIEL BUFF
T F T
chadgar
just ults right away then 2 autos for another
shojin + seraph + tear
10/10 game
then veigar 3 does 25k per ult
nobody dies so every round you deal 25
disgusting
dude i got a 6 yordle comp with sorcerer kayle
since horizon walker is melee either
also nah im not sniping forever. i was gonna take dueling at 6
just my 2c
i dont think you should retconn the shield or nerf it with a curse or anything but you should consider handing out an item to everyone else in scripted treasures so combat isnt too imbalanced
and for dungeons ill come up with specific items that are staticly there
when i need a random magic item
until i see an item thats ok for the person to loot
and just roll treasure hoard at pc level +2-3
the way i do it is i go here
true but if you gave jett a bow he'd probably give it away too
while also not being potentially worth villages
isnt great but its got uses
like a decanter of endless water
but usable
not optimal obv
but also be guaranteed usable by the person who rolls too
it should scale off quest difficulty is what im saying
i think the thing is db2 shouldnt drop 6* runes
thats good
ah aight
Idk. Something like that
And at higher level guild boxes give magic items
Or even something smaller like a consumable that gives a feat of your choice
Also I think a high roll box should at most be a +2 item that's an immediate upgrade to the pc or a rare wondrous item. Personally the way I do loot is they roll and you can just have a table per character or a short list of acceptable ones and reward one randomly
Only 2 things are controlling a pc at all is weirdchamp cause it makes them act out of character usually and also you should make high roll loot boxes stuff the player that rolled it can use cause otherwise it feels bad. Besides that the bone dome was cool
Btw I think session was good don't let Parsa flame you too hard
are we playing tomorrow or sat
Unlucky
also we yoinked your discord channel
with me and christina
what about tft
league
id probably pm jett and parsa the new ending we're going with
the stuff they know in character is important tho like what the guild and town is
true
and what the 2 new maps are
like the town
i meant more like telling them where they are
if you think its better that way then do it
since its not exactly where anybody left off
also you should let the others know what happened and how next session is gonna start
ahri now stops dashes with charm
league patch is pretty good actually
the allfather disapproves of moving too quickly
rta rules lol
yet weaker
its the boots of haste but more consistent
for that 22% chance to action surge
ez clap im runing myself violent
or i think its 18 now
16% for 6* rune good
good
db10 rates
well yea that only makes sense the guild isnt gonna give away magic items which are crazy rare already to random new members
&quot;good job heres a bonus&quot;
&quot;well you didnt sexually harass or rob people&quot;
or doing it right and not getting a complaint
for doing it on time or smth
you can call it a job bonus
good luck
hopefully you get his cool staff and not his underwear
heres a box of random dead johns stuff
congrats you finished a job
yea
so it doesnt matter
nobody ever really bothers to take them
metal scrap etc
like rations or ropes
at that point i just say you find random mundane things
yea ik what its like
but in the camp it was weird
and they give them out lol
like they have tiered random rewards that are probably just things they have left over from dead guildies or smth
it actually wasnt that strange from the guild
tbh its like the one thing that feels out of game
or is it d100 * d20
then total is on a table or smth like 1-30 is the shitty instrument, 30-60 is else etc
+d20
is it the d100
also how does your loot box thing even work
xd
whats our loot and xp for those bandits
yea. also as a player and not a dm tho
10/10
yd's intro to today's video
&quot;we have some undead to kill eskettit&quot;
&quot;hey whats up guys we finished our first jobs here we can show you around&quot;
cool. i think thats smoother
xd
cause thats more people to split the gold
yea thats fine. i just think itd be sort of out of character for us to bring extra people on a job we have mostly done and can finish easily
yea just something to think about. otherwise we could meet them in town the next day or smth and just say &quot;btw guys we're killing demons come on&quot;
i was thinking we couldve ended it by saying over the next 2 days we cleared the bandit camp and next time we go back to town to turn it in and find everyone but whatever you have is aight
yea i think it went well. besides the loot boxes it was all in realism and smooth so good shit
nice session yesterday btw
you wanna start call with everyone but mars or wait on him
you know i kinda forgot cause im so used to him just being away
oh right
any idea where the other 3 are
tru
off a brand supp carry game
got the stupid emote
asdfasdf
or instead of killing they take the unconscious ones hostage for ransom or smth
and then if combat is too hard or smth you can just adjust their hp without saying anything to be lower or change hit mods subtly. thats my personal preferred method
so about the saving throws thing i think that straight raising the dc is like a bandaid fix to make combat harder. this list is the one i was saying with all the different possible disparities that do something similar without just being numbers
I just parked
e
see you ther
aight ill be there in 20ish
aight. meet there or i can drop by and pick you up on the way
on like one street lol
the one theres 2 of
i can drive. i was thinking that sushi stop place on sawtelle
or sushi
sure
did you eat yet
shes shit
idk why everyones playing that
except the qiyanas
yea. this doesnt feel as bad
nah s4 stomps were fast as fuck
kinda. i like going next quick tho
ofc ez
jinx
rengar top 
idk what happened this patch but its like s4 again
thats not really losing much tho

This is so much better than the source characteristics on monster races and elementals
This is so much better than the source characteristics on monster races and elementals
bless
its not julie anymore
my raoq is my new first monster in the line

im working on ramahan rn
tru
and skype decided i wanted it delivered today
i sent that shit last night
fucking skype
can you even see this
wait nothings going through
Yea the mechanics ideas are great
Just makes more diversity in special weapons. Instead of a +1 sword it could be a masterworked +1 sword of cold iron
Yea. There's a post on exotic metals like cold iron and infernal steel that I wish I had earlier
but with more description
yea. also that last generator link is kinda like the other city one
but the mechanics and worldbuilding writeups are super useful
tbh im not huge on the plot hooks ones cause theyre kinda generic
ye
this one 10/10
this just explains titles and how they worked
sharpshooter as a reward for winning archery contest kappa
etc
fight mechanics
plot hooks
its stuff like this post for worldbuilding
theres a lot of good shit in the top posts of all time
also i shouldve linked this yesterday
kk
sure
these were the links i was talking about for generic cities on the map
i had some ideas written but im in sb so i have to rewrite it
so you wanna talk about the map
Give toys
Fuck progress
I'm thinking blessing tbh
blessing or rune/grinds
got a dupe brandia
guess who
??
Also you need a ride to ax tomorrow?
Are you at work
Chinese suspension would've killed me
Chinese suspension would've killed me
Nobody here felt it apparently
Is it like yesterday's
I'm at the hot pot place
How bad was it
Dude I didn't feel shit
mountains and valleys or single valley or plains, forest, etc
yo whats your preference on area biome
league?
tft
gay
tft

feelsokma

1 ss for tiana
my hero
ping baron then dont help kill
flash steal last hit on wards
what al god
the game 2 lee knows how to grief
chogath the sleeper op. silencing bitches
griffin vs females
also
graphics and assumedly audio by release
i think its already better than underlords or the original auto chess
they just need to add panning around the map to look at other peoples boards
after watching underlords
it looks clean af
league chess
yo scarra put up a tft video
pog
rakan from trans
pog
world boss devilmon
cant take her out because she'll revenge stun you
strip into double stun
oh right. wait thats better
4-6 hits with 40% each
3rd aoe strip and slow
2nd same as fran
1st skill is 70% stun chance for vio/rev
wait dude the fire fairy 2a is broken
idk if its they take 1:1 or not but if it is its nuts
you lose 70% hp and they take fat damage
but inverted
yea ikr. also the light warbear 3rd is like molong
and his defensive stats make him perfect for raid
yea but hes up to 770
and both got +110 to their damage stat base
kro ratio went 570-&gt;720 and he already hit hella hard
ramahan s3 cd goes lower when you skill him down to 3 turns and has 880-1400 ratio depending on their hp%
i shouldve 2a kro or ramahan
thats a good time
any idea when were gonna run it
i have a labelled version but its my labels
understandable
bear
now the fun part of waiting 9 days for the energy to do kro or light bair
got bella 2a
and its mono element for the other one
cant use nat 5 for the rune dungeon tho
can bring my unruned raoq in
so twins + fran soloes inu 2a dungeon
It's lit
Yup the patch is rn
its finally here
you wanna play norms
yea
5 game streak ez
Also I'm fucking diamond pog
It's a metaphor for using heroin
Chasing the dragon is a meme
Xd
You don't like chasing the dragon
tfw you one trick sivir into diamond
or do you like guy searching for an eastern dragon of wisdom more
do you like the failed druid turned violent eco terrorist backstory more
Like ghengis khan shit
Like ghengis khan shit
Ooh for the North there's always cool horse warlords
I think those 2 systems were my favorite
There's also a post about mundane weapon upgrades
But kinda weird for dungeons
It's so much fairer for overworld travel and encounters
I actually like the week system but Ik Parsa doesn't
To maintain balance and shit
So you do 7-8 encounters in a week instead of a day for flavor
Also the alternative to a ton of fights in one day is the thing where short rests are a night and a long rest is a week
First one is God tier
Also if you need resources there's r/behindthescreen. R/monsteraday. R/dndmaps. Etc
And everyone's different background makes sense
Plus then noble status means less
And popped in
And you can hand wave someone joining later like they're just in the area
And pay / experience / items are just split to who's there
Maybe just the usual adventurer guild thing so jobs/quets can be done with less than the full party
But yea I think we want to do a more open world than narrow
Ruins of the empire
Lul. Idk I thought mostly about the main areas
Or throwback it's ruled by a frost Dragon
Maybe just goblins and orcs or smth
Except the snow areas
Well I have rough stuff like that for all areas
Nvm earth are farmers and shapers
And the air are spiritualists and traders
Earth are shapers and traders 
Fire are soldiers
So they lead. Or go become tidesages to guide those who traverse the rivers and seas
It would be a caste thing. The water are rare and you know provide them water
So left to deal with that which threatens nature in more direct ways
Hadn't thought of my character's background. Was actually thinking he went to join the genasi druids of the thorn divide but wasn't as peaceful as they were
Only the Messenger knows the way through. He's the guide for the elves, only appearing when disaster is near and needs to be avoided
I figured he'd be a wood elf from the area but like the story says the trees grow titanic near the Palace and bar entry
Anyway that's the big overall stuff I have. Lmk
So when the calamity passed they were able to enter the wider world
So when the calamity passed they were able to enter the wider world
Not sure about elves. Was thinking they were created by the gods of the celestial empire as a fail safe knowing eventually the other gods would destroy them out of jealously or the empire would consume itself
Then the dwarves were forced up by the calamity. Their older deeper tunnel entrances were lost but some still believe the cities stand and seek them, though most resigned to living in shallower cities or even above ground
Also why the desert and tech swamp are kinda shit. They didn't heal from the calamity like the center of the empire did 
Which is why magical items are expensive af in the books. They're super rare as nobody remembers how to make anything beyond minor stuff like bags of holding or potions
But the humans/orcs/gnolls/etc in the heartland of the ruined empire have more access to the magical gear nobody knows how to make anymore
Basically tho it was like the desert genasi and the techno gnomes were the lesser castes of the celestial empire and so weren't completely destroyed and is why they have better tech than the younger races that grew in the central ruins of the Empire
Cause I have cool lore ideas for that but I can write anything
Also what race are you thinking for the desert people cause I was actually thinking genasi
The only cool part of bfa
Or maybe tidesages are a thing
Like if you want to get across it you better go a few miles up river first
With numbers I imagined the restless channel as between 3 and 1 miles wide, average of 2.5. Moving at 5-6 m/s
I just like the idea of a continent divided by great rivers with a single source
But idk about that part.
Anyway the last part was going to say. 

Only then, under the burning eye of &lt;moon diety name&gt; can the bridge of eternity be revealed. Stretching across the lake, it leads to the hidden secret of mist lake, a palace tended to by the last remnants of the celestial empire (temp name). The final heirs of a grand civilization brought low by jealous gods, they tend to the final emperor as he grows beneath the waters. 
Well we can say we found an ancient map
Tldr. Nobody actually knows the Palace is there. Or the bridge
The great Mist Lake is the source of the worldâ€™s oceans, or so it is said. From its endless depths flows the mighty Restless Channel that divides the continent of &lt;insert here&gt; in two, along with her lesser sisters and tributaries. Yet few have seen what lies across the sea of mists, the boiling waters obscuring their secrets with a dense veil. Many brave souls have set sail in sturdy vessels only to be dashed against the enigmatic spires of carved stone that peek out of the tumultuous waters, the bodies quickly lost to the waves. The dense woods around Mist Lake are guarded jealously by the Elves of the forest and they never speak of what lies behind the lake, if they have even seen it themselves; for some who have ventured there claim the pines grow monarchic and impassable. &lt;Can omit this part to avoid giving away too much&gt; But the wise know what mysteries the lake hides. Once in a century, when the moon shines brighter than the sun on a night that bleeds into day, do the mists recede and the waters still.
right after i get to the graduation
i need to finish it
k
if you want to use it
i wrote something about the lake tho
was cause of how much 3k ive been playing
tbh the only reason i put that palace there
Good argument.<context suggestionId="e069862e-b7c1-4b26-942d-480a9a22ad3e" impressionGuid="E15B23A8DE3143618956E315E439022A" serviceTag="364589B14D034FF1B2716855A49CC804" clientId="E186D53CB2154951BE2EE48C2414F6AC" serviceTraceId="50D83033BECC4F4ABF0357F264400BB1" suggestionType="Reply" providerId="cortana"></context>
R I P
game?
Lame as fuck 
I have to go to Annie's graduation tomorrow
It's too far
Nvm
Fuck sleep
I'm getting on
Wait... Are we on 911
So maybe soon
What the current patch is
Actually Idk
Soon as fuck
Also ranked league chess drops 9.14 according to the reveal page
So he can put put mobs
Yea lmao. Hopefully itâ€™s a weapon too
that it was aids
and learned
i fused all my triana skillups at last
just wait for chess
nvm league is shit
to learn how to play teamfight
we should play real league
For league chess
Are you hyped 
also play league before i go lose series : )
i only have bella 6
wait no
i only got 2
that means tho that you need them all 6*d and runed
idk. still 25 whatevers
which is like 2 refills
and then its really only 25 runs each
you can get all 4
yea but if you run it 100 times with raoq bella + 2
aight 1-2 in series
considering its a 2* upgrade
yea but its not that unfair
and the dungeon sometimes drops ancient rune stuff
you need ~100 clears to fully second awaken
and at the end all monsters that can be second awakened get exp towards it
but one must be second awakened/second awakenable
5 stages and you bring 4 monsters
also the details on second awakening are apparently you need to run a new dungeon for them
league?
now i have to figure out how to do 20 hours a week
i finally got the offer fixed up and accepted
do you work today
youre subhuman im sorry
did you know lefty brains are so different from regular brains that most psychological studies leave them out
and waiting sucks
thing is their system is down so i havent officially accepted the offer
like an advance on the money
so im thinking of rewarding myself with the trans pack for getting the CP position next semester
it is
strawberry and toasted white chocolate
so im chilling with that rn
my parents bought salt and straw
aight

I need to sleep. Early flight
Yea why
Oof
I'm going to San Fran those two days
3 days
150 tokens
Didn't even leave any bitch ass prisoners so now everyone knows not to fuck with me
That felt good. Just had my archers rain fire arrows on them from behind a shield wall and shock cavalry kill the runners 
The last battle was 3 commanders 4 tiers above legendary and their armies full of elite soldiers vs his band of 2 peasant generals and their men
I had my emperor hunt him down personally like the dog he is
Together we owned half of China and took out another king but then he turned on me and now I own half of China
My own vassal betrayed me
yea but hes the exception
that isnt zaiross
like every other &quot;attack type&quot;
811
yes. hes got better 3rd than taor now
And my mechanics are returning
Yea. At least my teams are decent
i actually kinda like the muramana kaisa build. also i think my mmr normalized im at +21
I'm almost there
ay are you working
nah i need to apply more stuff
I'm gonna stay home today
Tomorrow or smth
I didn't get the internship so I need to go apply at more places
Aight
I don't have food home so I was gonna go to third anyway
Where are you getting your dinner
Yea I thought so
You work today right
Rip. I'm at the eye doctor's now 
you have time for 1 game?
that makes sense now
oh it had to patch because i earned a key fragment
k
its patching all over
oh ok
i didnt know the outlet had to do with this app
so thats cool
which just wont open
also i get home and everything works except league
anyway i bought these fuji apple caramels and i had a moment just now
so really that was never meant to be so its ok i ate it
in my defense one was &quot;candy clouds&quot; which was like a gummy core stuck all over with these popping bubbly candy things AND it was free with the 3 others i bought you feel
but im on box 2 and its looking like thats a lie again
so this time i got 4 and said id only eat 2
but i ate both
its so fucking good. i bought 2 boxes for christina when she was in hawaii
they do artisan candy
in century city mall
sugarfina
also have you heard of a store called sugarfine
but support is broken
her lane is legit good now if you max w second
i popped off mid into zoe 
not even just supp tho
500 aoe shields on 8s cd
i had a 33 kp game on her
you know lux is actually busted
you read my mind
nah im at usc cause i need to move out later
and im bored
everyones out of my dorm
ay you home
Ik. Closer than I thought
Im outside
I forgot how gay this street was
It took ten to park
I'll be there in twenty yea
Aight
Do you have power
I'm gonna mob yours and we're gonna get ice cream
Well my house is blacked out
I mean I know what it's like
Why would you do this to yourself
Let's go there I'll get you some
Actually you want to go to salt and straw
Fair. I got nothing the rest of the day so
What time are you thinking
Do you want to get dinner or boba or smth
My girl
Lux finally got competitive play
Also why tf is the day I'm back and can't play the day you aren't at work
Also why tf is the day I'm back and can't play the day you aren't at work
I did see. Wack af 
You working today?
so broken
is a boosting lane
naut lucian
like a C tier instead of F-
also post hotfix yuumi is ok
trading lp for tokens
more token farming
thats how weak she is
is barely winning 2v2
like yuumi lucian into naut ez
or one strong enough to fight
you need a lane that can disengage
that shit sucks
N O
like idk. they need ot make her ult stun instead of root
less cc
she has fat heals but not better than janna or nami
her late game isnt great either
to carry her
but like idk you NEED lucian or ez
and you take heal/ignite
so your adc can go tp or barrier
yea. you kinda get away with it cause you have 2 combat summs
unless you jump onto a teammate
and you need a dash to use her r right so only lucian works for it
her q doesnt do shit unless its a slow for a hyper early adc like lucian/draven
the problem is she has to get items before her heal/shields really do anything
which is way better for trading
instead of you soaking a bit then hopping on them
the afk yuumi shit just means your adc dies first then you
you literally just trade away your 200hp then hop on the adc
flash wont save you
you have 400hp level 1
no flash
shes a cat
no smite
ok take ignite/exhaust
even sona does more and is tankier
but bad
just nami/janna
definitely shit tho
1 did ok but it was mostly my lucian carrying
and had a better record but 2 inting yuumis
so then i went adc
like i had decent kda just wasnt really paying attention to the map
so i couldnt jg
not even my mental was shit
its the wins that count lul
but you know what
actually i may have lost more than 10
and im ahead of where i started
then i had 4 wins
at some point
8 in a row
i lost 10 ranked games yesterday
today
damn i have an interview at 1-130
when are you not at work
make a server again
also fucking minecraft new update is hype
are you working again today
lmao
you back?
Aight down
Kms
Christina left for Japan and I'm bored
i gotta drive home
duo 1
p3 84 lol
im same lp as you
i got one game
league?
gay
your schedule
Games were supposed to be at 5 lol
Except the computers didn't work so now it's smash
So they invited c9 and fly quest here to watch the league match between us and ucla
I guess this is dinner
Wild
And a whole table of little bite sized foods
And they deadass got full black tie servers and bartenders to cater
I'm at the usc game expo showing of student games right
feelsgoodman. play league
also im done with finals
ik. feelsbadman
OMEGALUL
also the hoh is light joker
we gonna be masters now
aight
christina has to move her stuff out rq
you wanna do one more
league?
We're at salt and straw so we'll be there around ten
?
What time 
aight
do you want me to bring incense
aight i guess
kk
lmk what diego says
sure
plus since you work together you shouldnt make them dislike you for his shit
realistically you should force diego to tell them since he invited
for this scuffed shit
thats pretty much the choices
well either we can do it your place, downtown, or just make diego let them know to not come
or smth
have to do it here then
see the thing is i know my parents are chill if its just you guys but not randoms. we
guild only group
no randoms
tf
What time are you thinking
people would actually buy so much more
we need american commercials like this
whos worthy of a 25 spd will rune
foreign commercials are wild
also watch this
fuck thats hot
5 on the grind
lucky day
4 off
also a 20 spd will hp 6
pog
finally maxed healing music
just one more and its lit
aight so i have one set fit for kata-bale r5
or if they were restaurants they were unremarkable
like whatever the new restaurants replaced
i thought they were mostly stores
if only they didnt run out of the crazy feta dip at like 6
so half chicken half beef meatballs is a game changer
i learned you can get half-half of meat
speaking of cava is 10/10 fast food
also north italia
idk cava, uovo, ippudo, hiho, are all new
or maybe thats just cause its new
now 2nd has the good shit
yea idk. i feel like i got older and now the places on 3rd arent as appealing
which arent technically on 3rd
i went to uovo and ippudo
nah i havent eaten on it lol
i think you do too
this is her 3rd or smth
she technically has more job experience than me lmao
like 3 of them do
her friends all work at fucking abercrombie
you know i told annie about the promenade discount and she told me i was lying
i see
didnt get either tho lol
christina and i were there thursday/friday at random times and popped in looking for you and diego
which 4
do you only work weekends
oof its pog
did you see endgame yet
im waiting for their buffs
nah fuck that
ive been hounding for months
listen if i scrap louise i can get that rage cr gem
now GZ ancient crystals
no longer RIP dupe
also the new nat5 shop is pog
aight. that MIGHT be when i go in for an onsite interview but its fine cause ill be back by night
cool
Unless you have a better place idea
Ayyy. We can do it here
Yea do it next week
I'd be down next week but otherwise nah 
And final Thursday
Shit dude I have a paper due Monday midnight
I'm in finals week
??? Are we doing it this week
I'm in sm watching end game
yea hopefully
otherwise ill just look for the other place
probably 8 weeks
im leaning towards trying to get a 40hr week
ill wait and see
cya
yea cay
yea but idk it feelsweird without equal pay or hours
which is weirdchamp
at 30 an hour for 40 hours a week
idk but like if i get both 25 an hour and only 25 hours a week christina makes pretty much double me
they get 17.50 an hour and pretty chill hours
nah just for money
theres a place in sb im really interested in but i just now did the application
like otherwise i could keep looking
instead of 25
no i mean like 30$ an hour
also do you think i should be a TA for a class
or at least get 30/hr
or should i push to try to be full time
do you think its worth to just take not that much money but have a lot of free time
at like 25 an hour
this place that does mobile games is probably going to accept me as an intern but its supposedly part time 25hrs/week
yo i need your opinion on smth
instead of patching normally
why does league always restore to an older version
4
im pretty sure we can do my place as long as we dont make a mess
for l e a g u e o f l e g e n d s
so im down then if youre free
also im out of class probably 9-10
idk your place or mine
I just want my wings man
She's gonna take a while
Either way. My Louise isn't even skilled or runed yet
more violent will sets to farm
fuck
oh shit wait i have a wind threat now
why are my blessings always dupes
choice between vanessa and charlotte
no skip button
i did a scroll for food
WTF
you wanna play a game of league before i sleep
just need to fucking animate it
i even read some of the manga so ik they make some serious progress
yea. i cant wait for season 2
Yea ik I sped lul 
I'm here
5 minutes
rn
nah ill go get you
namu
anyway come to kbbq. were going to bud namj
&quot;yes, I like milo&quot;
you wanna come with?
also were gonna go to a place called &quot;oo kook&quot; and im not even making it up
hes the best
did they introduce the treasurer
but still really autistic
yea ik. its the less autistic b-gata h kei
apparently someone animated that whole thing alone
credit scene
did you see the chika dance ending
anyway chika tho
i could get you. we arent going for probably a hot minute tho. actually trying to figure out our plans rn cause her friends are kinda far
you wanna come lol?
also nah no mouse and im going out to kbbq with christina later tonight anyway
hell yea. every girl is best girl
i wish. im back in sm until tomorrow afternoon
or chess
league?
1k damage at a time
residentSleeper
so shes never getting stunned
bitch kept blue and twins/tyron wont let her move
10 minutes into toah boss
for now it stays on her
yea. i may actually want to give this set to someone else but i havent thought of who yet so
need to find a 6* spd rune
kinda pog actually
vio/broken
also +142 ophilia
what kind of fuckboi puts his verde on swift just for special league
so then i tilted and stayed f3
and i banned his orion but then swift verde
i got cleaved by some fuck going garo verde into psama lushen orion
my verde isnt fast enough
no
do i risk it
and 3 less to drop
only takes 50 more for c1
fighter 3 special league
call
chess
tbh tho that bitch is so nuts id build a second anyway
yea. need a second full revenge fran but it should be good
also new raid team idea praha delphoi louise / fran stella homunculus
and all the generally good nat 3 suck ass
ive realized that to win that you just draft slow + spd buff
fucking slow debuff is nuts
and the yd vs chat
also this new yd stuff with the premium pack rta stuff is hilarious
put it on medusa for instant ulti and just auto win
on day ill have the 1200 damage 2 second cd zapper stick
hmm
actually its doable since items drop
fucking game winning if you keep whoevers holding it alive for 10s
so its busted
i guess they thought it wouldnt be possible
that thing is pog af
and does 1200 damage or some shit
dagon 5 has no cd
youre special
nice P
and then gods dont
and then it activates
but demon hunter i think cancels one of them
so then gods do
yea 2 demons dont activate
and hope they dont have anti and terrorblade
do you ever run doom sf
yea. puck cm razor gives mages so thats good
no gyro no sniper
idk
puck?
probably tide, disruptor, techies(?),
ideally youre 2 gods, cm, razor, timber, + 5
its weird tho cause you dont want to run mars early 
it reduces by 75%
yea you can 
etc
only one human so it has to be CM
like either no demons or 2
yea. you have to be really specific about what you run tho
fucking timber on that was doing 600+ dps cause he kept spinning
unit seems busted
also i saw a zeus comp deal 40 damage in one round
it would be really nice to raid with myself but thats at least lisa and miyang to build
panda
homun?
dias
darion colleen
no atk break tho
bl stella homun
fl louise praha lisa miyang
i mean i could build a second raid team actually
i see eruption more
wind?
he's the nat5 for people without nat5s
etc
his anti rez is raki lite
eruption is brandia lite
his fire aoe spd scales but hits less than my spd build zaiross and no reset
all his skills are just shitty versions of other's lul
so hes kinda just useless
but it turns out twins also solved necro for me
time to respec him
also i fully beat toah without homun
thats unacademic as fuck
who would ever put a question mark in an essay
it knows
skype said
It's working<context suggestionId="7933cdb2-eaf3-4a2e-9d01-0e7898e961a0" impressionGuid="FACF3F8D642F4D9B8B92ADA58BC82564" serviceTag="ABC335F81E73436D8F2B61C22F9BBC07" clientId="97557947285B4406BD96E29816BF1DA0" serviceTraceId="08316AACEBD1495EB8611227414D9AED" suggestionType="Reply" providerId="cortana"></context>
its very disappointing
yea. i really wanted to build an aegir
disappointing
and i was wrong about the anniversary one, theres no barb king. only lich or neostone
fucking trevor hoh is lame as hell
if i want to keep the speed i only have 41cr and slower she'll move after garo
im trying to get vanessa on cd but i cant get decent cr and keep her current speed
just makes them a threat instead of a nuisance
my tesa is 66 and it crits enough
and still rune cd
ive looked at g1+ players and most only have 50-60 cr
why didnt i rune cd
i ran spd hp atk tesa and vanessa for 2 seasons
also why am i dumb
fair. i think counter phase is the only passable one
also my light rift is sss consistently so i could build the light homun but i think thats the lowest prio of them all lul
so you cant bring raki that way
well perna doesnt hit those unless the other 2 are water
sucks defense tho
run her on offense into perna/rakan for free win
i mean i agree shes underwhelming but shes also a really thick wind tank
i figured she could make my raid safer
you really think louise is that low prio
i have enough for 3 rn and 2 later
what do you think the order is in these 5: racuni, olivia, antares, louise, ophilia
im really hopeful for this rta season
there is also a nasty full fire comp idea with vanessa garo racuni ophilia tesa or even sekhmet if she ever gets runed
rn vanessa is faster but not tesa unless garo lead
also do you think tesa should be faster than monkey for set up or slower to get their immunity stripped
like mjolnir TA and battlefury doom
so you get some hype shit
still means a lot of items in the last 2
it goes to the survivors
items drop when a person dies
also did you see all the auto chess changes
no more 50k hp amarna living and full res
better one is average of 26700 worse is 26200. its 10cr higher but less cd and atk. 9.5k with bern
also i put my second lushen on rage and now theyre both really good
better than jeanne maybe
ophilia actually has a pretty lit first skill
and hes got the heal on 2 but she has it all packed onto 3
her first is still also shittier than his
but comparable
so still worse
she'd also still be 16 base speed under
yea but idk i think its something theyd do. cleanse or immunity
where woosa has 1
nah if it was only 2 turns she'd have 2 turns of no immunity
on 3
wait ophilia shields too
yea. i feel like theyre gonna give it one of the two eventually
its just a heal and shield
it doesnt cleanse
they might
they gave lulu immunity
fatter than woosa shield but less immunity is fair
they need to put 2 turn immunity on that ability
lmao true. shield is fat tho if you somehow need one
ophilia has 3 1 turn cd down skill ups on 3
both have 2 1 turn cd skills on prayer of protection
louise gets 20% to her heal and 1 turn off its cd
skill her or louise you think
so idk
but its also only 3 turn cd
yea its only 3 hits lul
its kinda dank
so while theyre forced into hitting you the other 2 gang you
cause you literally have to hit her and her thing ignores will
full swift with 2 dd
shes the meta g3 gwd
i probably missed another nat5 in there...
i probably shouldnt have put toah off for 3 months
Josephine next com2us pls
Josephine next com2us pls
Louise off a random scroll like 2 weeks ago remember. Never built too 
I just got Ophelia off toah legendary
Only water to go
Wind and now fire
Nvm in the Paladin whisperer
only a khmun skillup
imagine 750 stones no gany/oke
sounds kinda worth
another guy apparently refilled wings for 6 months and got all towers maxed
people are building second chloes for it
af
f2p
but the new one is chloe -&gt; imesety -&gt; galleon -&gt; lead(elsharion/shihwa/etc) -&gt; balegyr -&gt; kata
although i guess you have jamire for the old one
since you like chloe so much theres a new meta for speed r5
idk i just use the dark one 
shit youre right
its beautiful
have you ever seen 2 level 25 monsters with +6'd runes tank over a million damage before
never die
just extend light fairy invincible on the ragdoll floor
dark is god tier for toah cheese
man of culture. apparently only 6 are good. rest are under 45khp 100 res
&quot;I also really like the transmogs&quot;
for a free win
really any wind threat
apparently you just run rina into every seara/ritesh/wind panda/
&quot;siege and world boss&quot;
fucking commitment
4 bulldozers, 4 coppers, 3 imesity, 2 Olivia, 5 racuni, 2 theos, 2 tesa, 2 elsharion
14rinas built
someone hit g2 with barely any nat5s and apparently is pretty full f2p in gw/siege
I want to put Vanessa on CD too but her other runes have no cr
I ended up building tesa on cd
9.8k hp 580 def
also wtf racuni stats are shit
meh
somehow both his tankiness and damage feel kinda men
i dont need to do pve
also fuck elad and fuck mav
idk if its enough damage actually
yea. its insane for a s1
fucking clapper skill
with his spd buff his 1st ratio is like 800
yea its nuts
50k on first
spd buff atk buff def break
also fucking garo is nuts
yea but it deserves to be on a rune with more speed
but i kinda fucked that, couldve been better but im saving the gem i guess
def% was gemmed on
nah theyre all grinded
but i used the blue gem and it rolled 5
i couldve used a legend gem on the def% to get it higher
fat
15 spd 31%hp 12% def cr and cd intrinsic on 3
nvm i found a fat endure set
or vio/broken with better stats
vio/will tesa
 so wind cant hurt me
at least my best are all fire tho
the wind threats are all nat5
right
ill rerune sekhmet and raki too for this
verde 
vanessa triana fran garo racuni tesa jeanna tyron praha monkey chilling
i mean its a good core of units besides no wind
so i can yoink both big water threats
OR i build aegir myself
water is kind of a cursed element
the ones that can solo you can counter with tesa
aegir is kind of one but he wont solo 3 
not threats
theyre mostly supports 
idk i think waters not a huge problem
or people literally draft their rush hour defense on you
zaiross cleave countered
ban your lushen
vanessa garo triana
too many nat5s counter it
it kinda sucks in real rta even with tiana
for wind
i dont have shit
but yea im still kinda fucked against water
and if they last pick one i just ban it
yea but obv i dont pick that full team if i see one water threat
depending if im first or second
vanessa first or vanessa fran
cc comp
also i can draft into praha jeanne tyron
besides monkey
true but theres no real water threats right
do you think drafting vanessa garo fran monkey racuni is too fucked when a dd gets banned
i guess verde could be one
yea
l u l
monkey garo
i need a 3rd dd
cause it sounds like its doomed
maybe get all your shit looked at
and just paste it whenever you need it
or go online and find one
copy my p
or copy paste the characters
at
just get it looked it
its doomed
idk man get fucked i guess
thats really funny
hahahha wtf
thats so fucking weird
lmao wtf
p?
for a bruiser build
which is fucking insane
close to 10k 
with fran atk buff
i tested it in gw and it hits 9k+ per
yea its so fucking fat
when he should probably go first to strip
but now i realize i runed monkey to go after vanessa
cause its got def break into kill built in
i like the core of vanessa garo monkey racuni
vamp broken
is that garo isnt on will
the problem with my vanessa garo racuni one shot core
ill rune her and shit after i get wings
im just gonna do racunia and antares
i told you rn im only building for rta
nah when tf am i gonna use her tho
both it is
nvm i apparently have farmed 40 3* rainbowmon in the last week already
theyre both meta af
fuck
racuni or antares
cause if it attacks it has no atk bar to reduce
i just realized my full revenge louise build doesnt work for r5
Same. Night
Then we're set
I like it. They're cool. I just need 2-3 to max my tyron
Sylphs op again
And shaina megan set him up
Also he cleave better than zai cause you draft double spd lead
Now he's just better
Yea. He's always been my go to spd lead for lushening
So usually misses one
78
Not insane runes or anything
+1400 atk 91spd 196cd
Yea
If you set up atk buff and def break
Also shimi on rage spd cd atk does 15k a hit
It's a dream ok
Yea. Hopefully gany or oke next week off stones
Yea. Hopefully gany or oke next week off stones
I told Christina after I burn all my remaining crystals on refills I'll only get packs for a month and save it all
Hopefully I can get a pair of those too 
This season aura is also wings 
Finally. No bitch under 1k bonus atk
Monkey is swole final
Happy with the results tho
I spent all day fully redoing runes
Also my Bern 300 now
I'm runing for real rta. He's good against others cleave too 
I think every rune is perfect. No flat stats
Monkey is like 6-7 slower. Needs a grind
Also exact speed of vanessa with her lead but since it's hers she goes first 
Rep worthy tbh 
His atk went up 200 today
Check my garo runes now
coming in with wings and auras and shit
and everyone in fighter+ is c3 in real rta
its literally cleave vs cleave
special league
i hate
maybe this is why im behind on nat5s
like 1 premium a week
apparently most people just do packs
+ siege yea
cause someone did the math and f2p you can get the 4k crystals a month
yea. another thing is i talked to my guildies
i need her on will for my cc comp
or double nemesis will
also do you think despair/will praha
pretty nice
garo to +1200 now
fat increase
3% + 6% to 11% + 6%
if you remember my struggle over having 2 and 1 gem
also i rerolled and grinded the atk% on that second cd fatal rune
he still works with garo or olivia/copper cycle comps
just not broken like he was during the jeanne meta of cc chains
nah he was still considered A tier last season
also should i build that cheese olivia/racuni or just stick with antares and aegir next
and people always go for him first
30% revenge chance
chiling pretty lit
ive got those
does monkey or chilling count
just praha. unlucky
is an oof
tyron jeanne into no immunity comps
but hes violent will so i can
idk how to use this in rta
discount verad/poseidon+ done
and just cuck someone out the gate
like full swift/will
do you think sekhmet works as budget oke
fuck the gany oke rotation is next week
yea its not bad
xd
free money xd
also lets me buy shit with amazon coins so
i use bluestacks now
but i got the monkey one so im only at 11 stone
i like the lushen mog
transmog day event is kinda sick
hp spd cr
dont need atk for verde tbh
that dont have cr
i have a lot of fast revenge runes
i could use some of those tbh
even a blue can get 4%
i have in every set but rage
85 is the sweet spot
im still waiting on a rage cr gem
the cr isnt a clean 80 tho but cd is a clean 230 after
1% all around
its just the dankest upgrade
so theyre back to 1 apart
its on the slower lushen
i just got a grind for 5 flat
actually the rune itself is 1%atk 1%cr 1spd 1cd
its 5 over 1% atk
14 flat
oig
found a rune with 14 atk, 1cr, 1 cd, 1 spd bonus on lushe 
5$ for 11% value on every refresh
its sick
also new daily pack raises your max energy by 10
This season aura is sick
Don't want to do Louise yet cause rta
Aegir kind of overlaps monkey, chilling and elsharion overlap and he just got buffed but I don't have yet, and antares is niche
Aegir chilling or antares first
Like maybe Orion
Gonna be a fast boi 
Yea. That and my 25 spd guard rune need a home
High roll legend
+5
My Verde gonna be full revenge 270 in 5 more of those
Got a 27 spd revenge rune post grind
Also I've decided. 7k crystals rn. All on db10
Christina and I are gonna see captain marvel rn and jett said you're on 3rd
Also are you off work
Shaina stun?
Yea it's not like taor is super crucial
with +142 and 85cr
theres also the high iq take taors spd rune build
theres also a swift/guard with +14k hp 1300atk +118spd 76cr 175cd and no acc
so that build is swift/will 12khp 1300atk +92spd 175cd 82cr and 25 acc
no that is compared to current
it wont change his atk
no hes +800 rn
except for the part where its still only +800 atk
i kinda fuck with that
Deadass the +140 build puts him 255 base. 290 after Vanessa lead
Yea but speed
even if they arent all good
i get a lot of legend 6*s 
also is will my lucky set
without the atk bonus tho
cause i can get it to +140
or just go ham on spd and ignore the will set
do you think +500hp +525atk +21spd +4cd +16acc and will is worth losing vio 150def and 18cr on monkey
45k+ hp and then just shield for 15k a turn
seems kinda troll. i was otherwise thinking just vio triple hp%
i dont really use her any more
and give louise her runes
also do i just say fuck you to chasun
are you high
?
her heal is thicc
i hear louise is the best everywhere but rta tho
i really wanted josephine
water is josephine
fire is ophilia
wind
are running so low
also my fucking vio will sets
cause i never get the right element
not the water one
also by paladin i mean louise
but did you call they'd make him better than poseidon
also yea you did
xd
got a paladin
guess who
hard counter to unicorns
also antares is kinda good now
verad lite
nvm hes better i saw the new awakening bonus
Poseidon lite now
Lmao tyron buffed
Strip into def break provoke and dd
I finally reruned Praha and speed tuned her to go first then vanessa jeanne garo. With fran I think it's a good combo team
Rta me I want to test a new comp
vampire
did mystic first
had a mystic and the monthly lnd
fuck me
her base stats are dank
even res runed and level 35 my jeanne is at 30k
i swore he had like 50%
or debuff
that fucker never fails a stun
are you sure 30 isnt acc
i heard it was literally 0
oh wtf
nah cause the 45% is even on the mons that awaken into res
r5 is literally 0 tho
so im only 15 off
well apparently 45% is enough to guarantee you never get resist outside of base chance
literally 0 resist
its like r5
toah 0 resist lul
like i dont think any monster does
cause even bosses cant resist provoke
with verde
this bitch is probably op in toah
is lit
100k exp per now
also bless the dimensional rift buff
aoe 2 turn cc into vio proc
i love her 3rd skill so much tho
so i can run nuke, jeanne, triana into verad comps
i need to put a nuker on will
and not a high rolled perfect res
but its a blue rune
the only comparable rune i can put there is def%
her lead is fucking stupid high
yea it is
that would keep her vio will
i also just dont have a better rune there rn
but gw she's better off using her own lead i think
i mean i could run her at 100 res without lead for rta and stuff
hmmm
her leader skill is res
oh wait
the cancer of gwd
+140% hp, 100 res, 30 acc, +112 spd
nah its 100
lul
98%
shit no
she's at max already with just those
i have 20 res on the s5
1% more effecient than a hp% rune
ungrinded
will slot 6 with 10 spd 13 acc 19 hp
is there ever a world where you put a REALLY good res rune on jeanne
ez clap
cowgirl sd
LMAO my first hall of light run
you doing anything tomorrow?
just need the cowgirl i guess
surprisingly easy and quick to level the kaz harmonia ling ling
ive gotten fucked by this bitch so many times
aight guess its jeanne week
i miss the reapp pack
essentially the conversation
&quot;nah nah nah. its not a ponzi scheme cause were using our new money to settle our old debts then get rich on taking cuts&quot;
&quot;that sounds like a ponzi scheme dude&quot;
&quot;were gonna pay off the previous investors with the money from the new investors&quot;
fucking retard admitted to running a ponzi scheme on stream basically
no it was ice poseidon
Garo rune
Yoooo
like not a swat call by a viewer but legit fbi investigation and search
did you hear some streamer got raided by the fucking fbi
at least it means i can get it somewhere in mid season
fuck it
kms
kms

s l i m e r a n c h e r
i hate this new skype
c a l l

for goblins
people were rolling round 6
the last time i even looked at the game
aight lets do that then
idk which one are you feeling
the good old biweekly try
since its patch day
or league
eskettit
oh god 2 weeks ago or smth
theyre generally known as homeless
just grimy
its nice
+ an hour or two to train back
2
but christina is going to sb for the weekend so idk
i might go back after my class since i dont do shit friday
do you have class tmrw
no i mean idk if he has a shift friday lol
ill ask
idk if hes even there
cause i have to go back into town for a passport renewal

i hadnt been in a while
end of an era
jerry is probably leaving campos
l u l
yea understandable
cool. i can hang sunday cause my assignment is due sat midnight
when
sick
if he starts under 15%
lightning roar dot cant even kill him
cause garo is a god
but works
so fucking jank
lone shaina zaiross colleen hwahee backline
with 2-3 backliners dead
a lot of times it was him or laika doing the last hit
or hes at like 20% when lightning roar hits
garo cant die to beast unless it gets to its ult
90%
lmaooooo
garo laika frontline
i got sss on wind
i forgot
OH SHIT
you had vampire ardella wtf
is lit
or straight one shotting with atk buff
no setup
10-12k on pernas
but like still
on triana with low def
no def break
mine straight does 12k on s1
and its kinda gay
garo just straight hits harder
down 2k after 5 6*
and im still running out fast
like i dont feed  2*
i mean im not even super ineffecient with them
and this is kinda worrying
cause im down to sub 1k
are you out of unknowns
oh shit
tf
does arena even give exp
who couldve known 2 years ago he'd be meta
i shouldve skilled aegir 
at this point tho im only building for rta
level 35
i have one mostly full skilled
and hrael
2 acasis
with 15 ms and legendary
i bought that starter pack
id still be set
and not the s3
if they just switched her element with ethna
fuck me why is raki fire
covenant is a gw nuker anyway
otherwise itd be impossible
and decent attack
+15k hp
so you can be despair will with 100cr
is that you dont need cr subs
well the point of running cr on 4
unless you run her with vanessa/triana
yea. cd is too squishy tho imo
as fast as possible with atk subs
is the way to go imo
yea. max skilled ethna spd cr hp
everyone has fran verde
feng ethna garo
you have good rta units
build your garo
and idk if i couldve done it without my phone
yea but like i worked 7 hours a day right
puke
no phone
or just a few days a week
are you full time
and auto shit xd
you can just leave your phone and battery somewhere in the break room or smth
get an external battery
i mean its still good
yea youre fine
or like 15-16 an hour
i was like 111 a day
was garo dupe tho
and like i was only there 7 weeks
after summer i had enough for basically as many packs as i could justify to myself getting
yea but youll be set after a month or two
xd
isnt that why you got a job at uniqlo
just for garo
i took laikas good runes off
or really you got better laika
yea but you got laika
and hes a fucking beast
i use mine rta almost every fight now
thats still smth
so you got a really good nat4
what about the legendary
l m a o
otherwise hopefully i can sneak into c1 somewhere in the middle of the next rta season
big brain
theres a 1/1000 chance a trans scroll is in there
nah the real play is actually the anniversary is coming soon
ignores immunity
and now hes nowhere
i remember him everywhere
fucking tyron
spd lead and spd scaling aoe
hes still really good imo
lapis
first nat4 shimi
level 15
just finished faimon
yea she is now
i will
if christina gets a nat5 before me
for a better cleave
yea i need woosa or tiana tho
At this point I just need more will runes or a wind threat like ethna or diana
if i used yesterday
this might have been doable
i climbed to 1420
well shit
rta c1 should be 15% cause nobody plays
fuck me i guess
1550 is c1
1388 rta is 13%
counters vanessa too hard
fuck oke
cleave bitches the rest of the season and repeat
and just get my wings
im gonna cheese for conq early next time
too many good people climbing
i gave up on rta this season
hmm
also when do you start work
its mostly shaina since the boss takes her
ive seen triple strike take the boss 80% to 0
3 min to 1 min runs
i got 3 legend 6* will runes in a day
the fuck is necro
so idk what to respec him for
but now the thing is that its good without homun
also necro is so much more bearable at a good speed
if i didnt drop from 1400
200 to go
also 1350 rta
its just MA now
what happened to your profile picture
True but itâ€™ll take longer 
Cause I could just farm fighter for points rn
Idk if itâ€™s worth the effort
Which one
Plan 2: hope none of my shit gets nerfed and grab it next season
Plan a: push to 1550 for conq this season
Holy fuck I'm hyped
Holy fuck I'm hyped
Instant buy 
Dfghgsdhhfsa
YO WTF FRAN IS AVAILABLE AGAIN
You wanna hang before 11
To be 140 and follow right on Megan
Exactly. Really the only debate is maybe swift instead on shaina
Just maybe not rifts
Yea but also necro
Switching all the vio runes
Just the cr really
I couldn't even make her that much better
I could see what non vio runes make her fat as possible
They're both atk cd atk tho. If either vios they both hit really hard
Yea
Overall I think it's worth more
And 22% &gt; 13%
A turn is worth more than a crit
13 cr is less damage than 22% extra turns
Lost 13 cr but got atk and 2 spd 
Lost 13 cr but got atk and 2 spd 
Yea I traded it to vio
Thicc sabrina and fast shaina
Oh fuck ya
My cleave team is perfect for special rta
Shit you right
Just the other two
Just the other two
Christina is in Hawaii
We just finished are hills mountains and what's the difference
Give me an autistic conversation topic
It's kinda nice
Nothing left to collect
I'm like full done with the event lol
And event devil
Monday passed
Did you skill him
How's galleon doing
And make you feel bad
It's ok I'll send you all the cool pictures
Shin black and spicy
Not that maruchan standard shit
Quality ramen too 
And snacks
We bought a fuck ton of ramen
Yea. Should've bitch
Just past Bakersfield
Nah we're in the central valley
I'll deal with her after camp
Yea it's fine
Since Megan 270
Her at +130 can only be cut by a monster at like 260
Maybe I make shaina as fast as possible on vio 
Hey man I have one God set ok
780
She's the highest of any twin I think
And how thicc. Original was 98 and 68 spd both vio
Violent or nah
Or more damage for pve uses
For omega speed to go right after Megan 
At this point do I give her kahli set and a spd rune
And I'm just so tilted
For days
Yea but I can't use her
I'm so mad
Drive 
I got shaina on the side
Garo pog
and farm 12 4<b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*"> and then another 5 5</b>
Night reddit is wild
And then 3 minutes later I found a post of some doctor criticizing circumcision and a ton of alt right cucks attacking him in the comments
Fuck Indians holy shit. Literally all degenerates
On some gw post of an Indian girl
Just look at this
Just look at this
Dude I wake up 3 am and go on reddit right
cause if they arent immunity theyre dead
chloe+twins is common
and gw
2 fast twins in arena beats bruisers cause they just goon them
if you run her with shaina yea
like shes unusable in pvp then
thats pretty jank tho
unless i build sabrina just fat as fuck
but it kinda fucks me on rift beasts
and i can get her like +125 on vio for rta
other thing is i really need my shaina fast af
28%
yea 
+92
yea its just that mine kinda has to be nuke
but zaiross can theoretically do that
cause rn hes just a toah dotter
actually i was considering it
nah lemme just build a fire homun rq
lul
whos another swift attacker
so i might give them elsewhere
yea but shes got good runes
so idk what i built kahli for lul
but cycle fast enough to win
then you just snipe ad 4v3
cause you only bring 2 dd so one usually banned
no you dont rely on one shotting 2 on turn 1
especially cause my megan is like 270
but tbh nobody runs will so the other is just better for now
cause the last 2 have cleanse on resurge
you just turn cycle one of your nukers with imesety olivia racuni
2
the copper/bulldozer is apparenly not instagib 
same but olivia is actually nuts too
and see
or should i build the shaina version first
it just means twins wont get it instantly
i have the food for 2 more 6
cause apparently the real core is imesety copper bulldozer olivia
and racuni
olivia
and that i should build an oliva
i think its sort of the second
or my cleave is wrong
either im unlucky getting 3 people in a row with fucking wings in fighter
40 energy to max 3 2<b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*"> or really 40 energy for a 4</b>
blue 6<b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*"> or purple 5</b>
Tilts my ass 
Tilts my ass 
Point is why tf is woosa going after triana
well that's like a solvable issue
16 works too if you just grind it
Then your slot 2 finishes swift
that and 2 18 spd runes grinded to 21-22
Just get blue to roll up to 18 and you're there
That's better than my best lul 
Also didn't you get a 24 spd one
All blue swift runes and hero off set gets you to 290
No it's actually 118
His base is like 115
His base is like 115
Even without lead if that's not 280+ then wtf
Set
Woosa should have your fastest swift see
God damn degenerates
Fucking woosa shouldn't be going after 
They're only 270 after lead
Will
Violent
I'm talking my violent will Vanessa and triana consistently get turn one
General rune quality in fighter is ass 
Also unlike real arena you only need 50% to climb
I don't want to farm will I just want my auras
But whatever
Seems fucked by Bernard ban and outspeed into cc
or is that too fucked by megan ban
or bern megan zaiross lushen shimi/shaina
cant do the regular one cause no bastet
need one more nuker tho
imesety, megan, copper, bulldozer
also i was thinking of an rta cleave comp
like a nat5
are pog
also slot 3 spd hp res violent runes
A second unskilled is still good for siege
There's just not that much I have that's good
But he's kinda fallen off 
Racuni maybe
The one I'll have a 50% chance to have by tomorrow
Yes that one
Although shaina is a good backup pick especially with her runes
Everything else you can f2p unit
Sucks that rta is the only mode you have to summon for
Could build delphoi better
Tesa
I mean yea my second tier picks are like Theo raki 
I'll push for wings later
I just gotta be able to stay fighter for now and get those heart aura or swirling ones
That's the issue
I mean I don't have others
I was thinking taking the good runes off her and elad for Vanessa verde
Everyone bans my Vanessa when I just want to give her a shot
Gay 
10-0 rta placements. F1
Elad kinda pog too 
Nessa finally runed pog
Buddy
You
Fuck
StayBrutal. S labyrinth g1 siege and war
Wtf is fire sylphid even called
3.5
from a 2.7 chance to .35%
27
1/28 today
ok
3 days
:thinking:
You ever see how moiboi was last on summoners war a day ago and is now level 49
Or even hp res
All spd and cr with hp and atk% but only base rolls in them
Tru. I like bruiser damage runes now
Cd and atk useless
Could've been much better with spd or cr
Idk. Maybe just for a less important nuker
Yea. Cr fine spd 10 ok. Atk fine
Not sure who to use it for. Kinda dog rolled tbh
That rune from yesterday
He's now shit on you hou
Also shit hou deserved it
Guillliame but gay
Jean
Drum roll
I got
You hit 16 and become God 
Ascendant is a pretty accurate passive name
She's so gross at 16
Also I watched new kayle gameplay
Optimal auto response tbh
<ss type="yes">(y)</ss>
Both the other fucks were dragons abusers
Necro sss tier
While dealing 400 dps
Necro got 4 ults off and like nobody died on my side
And medusa 2
Real carry of the last game was double tide and necro 3
Still bishop 2 tho
5/5 yesterday
Kunkka?
same. fuck that game
are you ranked yet
yea im mostly thinking positional shit is gay as hell
it just needs way more development time
and im so happy about that
they said they might
i just want ranked system revert
its not bad tho
yea i see it
which one was unmasked kayle
max level aether wing is gonna be some mecha hitler shit
yea i think so
too bad her abilities are kinda boring
her passive has some great names tho
yea
from summoners war
its like the cyborg valk skin
i like riot
and they should do more
its a more classical style than riot usually does
and thats what matters
the art is good
its sick
looking like a celtic valkyrie
viridian is the one where shes vs morg
have such good splashes
dude aether wing and veiridian
But morg is sick
Yea. Lore and theme tho I like kayle more
I'm playing league just to use aether wing
Dude the kayle rework is sick
I've never completed an item so it doesn't matter d 
5
like not even 10
id legit pay 100k mana each to defuse them into mids
at least lows are fusable now
also high essences feel like a punishment
holy
that and the essence buff makes fusion so free
lows arent unusable 
damn i like this
im being gaslighted by sw
what is this
wait could you always do 5 at a time
for years
was i high af
but its 2 and 10??
no i thought it was 10k and 100k
was mid-&gt;high always 10
i thought it was 10
fusing essences is 2k?
wait
eh that killed it

lul
did like 100 in that hour
i smashed magic 8 during free energy
deadass think i have that
for 12 harms
ok so wait its 240 fire mid, 60 water mid, 300 magic mid
thats dedicated autism
o o f
or timeout
yea but most just perma that
fusions nerfed confirmed
20 fire 5 water 25 magic vs 35 fire 15 water 35 magic
what anarchy ass streamer
who doesnt ban that immediately
rebecca next one pls
so the 3* sd are twice a month
thanks, I hate it
yea there was a water frank one
or just the wind cat one in early jan
was there a second one in january
so theyll probably do it again
they opened her SD in november last year tho
thats 2 a week
...
well shes 400 gp
jojo has 15/10 raoq, 20/15 cass, 15/10 kuhn
harmonia way cheaper than jojo jesus
water bear: 5 water / 5 magic
fire vaga: 5 fire / 10 magic
rebecca: 15 fire / 10 magic
so i tuned out
idk it felt different
so i just dont care
nah idk the meta
cause i had no idea what was going on
i tried sneaky last night and couldnt take it
i havent watched league in so long
and its only 360 crystals a fusion
to get your 2 and 3*
about 2 years ago someone did the math assuming you start from 1* scratch
yea. and 4* fusion arent bad
is so huge
but 3 turn cd on passive and 1 turn off heal
like lushen and xiao lin are just a little extra damage
after that khmun &gt; triana cause shes fusable
raki s2 max is pretty necessary
curse of the thot maybe not worth
charming voice cd makes her at least less trash
i still have sekhmet and raki to skill
hell no thats way less worth
but triana seems worth
i didnt think it was worth for xiao lin or 2shen
i need 12
i think its actually a debatably good use of resouces fusing harms
my vamp set was the worst one of the3
maybe mine is just badly runed
maybe with a max skilled triana
idk if hes even good rta
all he does is tank taors
idk how to use him
the only 6* i shouldnt have done was garo tbh
still waiting on my lnd ones
ive gotten 40 legendary fragments this week
same
how do you fight that
boi has 3 lives
watching him tank by dying
its so fucking funny
theo was the tank
vanessa triana theo
actually the gayest gwo i had work today
still usable
oof
nemesis big gay
just no fucks given bring her into anything and she'll cleanse the damage if theyre cc
best runes
also will runes
240spd on vio
even without skills she provides insane support tho
i need 10k for hoh
cause im not paying 400gp for each one
need the rebeccas first
never bad
ran her every gwo today
my triana is a beast tho
is hard
yea but to get to 40k hp with spd on 2
maybe theres merit in a slower but fatter khmun
yea. max skilled its 8.75
yea but my shield isnt maxed so its a 7k shield
+142 spd
so like 34.5k
+23700
when you fight him
its not as much as it feels like
even with 40k his shield at max skill is only 10k
whats a good hp amount for khmun
consumer of candy
wheres your beedril, destroyer of worlds
but youre bad
i was gonna say gz
yea but khmun synergy with laika is better
damn whos losing to this shit
wait its just theo
this siege
my khmun laika chasun defense has more wins than me
and you get silenced to death
nobody dies
atenai darion and light magic knight
i got fucked by the fire one in siege
pog
no talia
no lightning
also 500 stones
if you didnt get one earlier
on the last craft
also the rune event has a guaranteed 6* legend
speed team dragons for a reason
xd
do runes
or dark serpent
hes a fucking monster on 4* tower with emma/luer
dark armor isnt even bad
or bulldozer
yea i was thinking of him + dark armor tho
but now its kinda too late
also should i build basalt i finally got one
com2us when
i need a rebecca sd
cant give him my view
i dont support tards
imagine getting banned from tardzans chat
ecksdee
they ban me
and when i call him a scumfuck degenerate piece of cardboard
dont you hate when boxite runs down and ints your lane
omegalul
is box  royale
so what youre saying
im done with box of legens
Boxarina resetting all over my ass
goddamn goxen ulti
i fucking hate that
Jox just killed me with his jump
ah yes
a shooter where you dont render a gun or characters is no effort
thats effort
i dont want to be just shitty CoD like them
but since everyone is doing a multiplayer fps
i actually dont care at all about this class
yea but you have to force people towards each other
not sure which is better
or a random area
just force people into the center
like the fortnite zone
with some penalty for being still too long or smth
or do i go hunting for boxes
do i be a box and be safe
against people tho its dank
this shit would be so bad against AI
idk if its online or lan
its supposed to be multiplayer
is this not fortnite
yea they do
so they have to catch you moving or turning
you could just be the stage
if everyone is a random box and the stage is just random boxes
but then its obvious whos the players
at least my meme isnt gay
cause thats both gay and bland
but i really dont want to make a regular fps
ik
sneak around hunting other boxes
its lit
box
you just are a bo
and tbh i think it sounds dank
since it saves me a lot of time animating
because this is my idea for class 
aka prop hunt but everyone is the prop and the hunter
and you have 10 shots to hunt the other players
milo would you play a game where you are a box on a flat map full of other boxes
at its finest
jew investing
i used it all for siege crystals
its true
With tri 
With tri 
And all I wanted was to play bruisers 
Adcs too good with free life steal and true damage
That's big gay
Wtf do you mean jungle is saved it got nerfed
Bless
Also I was so ready to play league but Diego saved me
Later yea
I'm making food rn
Why not
Verde covenant kahli tarq/taor and defense breaking nuker
Fair. Just replace Bella then 4head
Kahli + 30% but no self buff
Yea as a tarq sub or smth 
Alright but do you really need 5
Fuck
...
Nvm I went to get him so like 1220
Nvm I went to get him so like 1220
No jerrys a bit late. 1230
Weâ€™re gonna go over like 1215
It might as well read â€œat least one good rune of your choiceâ€
The only temptation 
Reapp pack
Itâ€™s back
Oh god
20% with howl lol
Last week it was 4% with Vanessa Praha Theo laika
Guess my defense win rate 
Kappa
I mean Tirana needs to crit
Itâ€™s a legend rune but one bad roll so purple pretty much
Also is a slot 5 vio 15spd 7hp 9cr 13res rune worthy legend spd grind
Wait no itâ€™s a purple rune with 1% cd more
Every time. Craft op
Hello comrade. We are here to seize the luck. Give it up fuckboi
Jerry has Friday off so weâ€™re set
That ainâ€™t violent <ss type="sad">:(</ss>
Guess Iâ€™m bad
Shit. And no rage blade or fatal legendary atk%
And no vio hp 6 better than purple and none with over 4 spd. Great
Upon trying to rune triana tho I found I have a 40spd will set but no 4/5/6 vio runes better than blue 
Just beat a verad ritesh betta with trash delphoi imesety
Delphoi and the goons dropping 50k nukes on people 
Wait I runed up a 5* imesety and now my copper comp is op
Hmm
Do I max guild flags

So now I need to farm more of them
I save grinds for purple+ runes
Yea exactly
Well guess my Skype is down cause nothing's sending xd
Pretty shit
Yea I checked. +132 before grinds
And with maybe 30k, 
Which isn't that good
Yea but like at best he'd be 230 spd
My nuker runes tend to be the better ones
<ss type="wonder">:^)</ss>
all scrolls except legendary are scam
no lightning
dude i got 5 scrolls from immemorial box
fire pack
scrolls
yea but like
just kinda thinking if any are worth
probably wont need to buy anything for a while
idk
reapp or immemorial box or devil
just waiting for one of the really op packs now
yuh
i kept hovering 10k from all the free ones
im finallly under 9k crystals
after 2 weeks tho
otherwise tiana zaiross psama is always gonna fuck me
spd lead, stripper, bruiser, cc
i need okeanos or smth
i guess tiana zaiross still works
vanessa triana praha +fire bruiser
like what do you bring against that ad
i think will tho
maybe vio nem?
vio will triana
its onto necro for will
then when i have a full vio set
 but nah im gonna run drag
i thought i was on giants
no i meant im doing dragons
actually no dragons now
omegalul
just burning through 10k crystals on giants
im straight af
me 
yea theyre pretty big gay
also isnt banana bread the fuckng codeword from spyparty
but im not with that cause i got hw and shit
i think theyre playing with one of our other guys
thats so fucking dumb
its sunday my guy
that was yesterday
didnt finish conq last week so now i have to
also when tf is rush hour
or praha-&gt;seara
whats better tho. teshar-&gt;perna, sekhmet-&gt;hathor/bastet, raki-&gt;ethna/beth
im telling you they need a 100$ pack to change a monster's element
or whatever water one is
and cam went the other way
to best
also isnt it funny how vanessa went from worst valk
qb kat jamire
gwo
would rather alicia/jamire/rakan
but shes aight
also dont really want fire unicorn
do not want praha on talia week
bastet, chiwu, gany
so bad
i want the nat5s next week
and one with just def for offense
cause you just have one with a lot of hp for defenese
yea 2 pandas is totally fine
one i dont want a dupe for
i think its praha or smth
which nat5 is it
woooh
cause i dont think the blessing works
how salty ill be
oh you dont know
i think one of my nat5s is that week
but the thing is
but maybe ill get the less op one
didnt get shaina 
3 weeks
talia on ss
or talia
nah youll get galleon when i get shaina
its back
oh shit
nice
and my phone isnt working
and my internets out
im still at 4 for accuracy
xd dont talk to me about immemorial
to use my grinds on
yea same so now i need more purple+ runes
xd
cause im near grind/gem cap
i need more runes now tho
the most upgrades come from raid
yea i feel that
for sure
a good rune is rarer tho
and one in 2 or 3 of those turns out decent
i think i keep one rune a refill
you got some shit luck then lol
giant you can 3 man
like if you have to rune dragon/necro it takes longer or is less safe
cause his runes are all in giants
lushen easy af to rune tho
especially since hed only be 30k hp
idk +140 khmun is still pretty bad
most people do
but fat
i want a 3rd shen slow as all hell
before grinds but thats at best _147
i was gonna say my khmun would be pretty shit at +132
also my phone skype messages wont send
fuck you i need those
My nuker runes tend to be the better ones
Idk if I have fast hp % runes
I have raki unfortunately
Not as cool as avaris but hey
Ik. But it's cool anyway 
He's ok without skills and easier to rune
Yea. Maybe I build khmun
I made one and it went into amp
Hopefully to get amp maxed only
Like I need to fuse 12 harmonica, at least 3 jojo, and 10 ling ling
And nemesis
And violent
Needs full skills to be useful
Like fucking triana tho
Those are smart
But the other 2 are easy to rune and skill
Idk and light dm that's kinda troll
I have tarw
I actually do want to build a kahli
Those are arguably more useful lol
But I'd be fusing skill ups for days, sad, or waiting months, respectively
Like I wanna build triana, khmun, Jeanne 
Lol I reset store for howls
And they're all skill up dependant monsters
I have enough for 3 but I don't have skills for what I wanna build
You build 6* really fast wtf
More useful than kaito
Aight. I'll tell him
Aight. I'll tell him
Either that or Christina wants hot pot. Which are you up for
<ss type="puke">(puke)</ss>
Sucks
Shit my mouse must've moved then
It's why it's fishing like once a minute or two instead of every 30s
Repeat over and over
Like it'll keep hitting it until the bobber phases downward then it's fishing
Until it syncs with the server
No it just does the repeated door open and close for a while
I just don't
I just don't
Also fuck rta
No look at the number
I'm guardian now boy
You didn't answer so you tacitly comply
Yea ok we reserved it. It was way cheaper

Could book here too 
Guess we're leaving Saturday night XD 
Guess we're leaving Saturday night XD 
Hmm
Actually they're booked Saturday night
Sat evening or Sunday morning departure
You wanted two nights or one
So like 30 a person
So it's cheaper at an airbnb. 155 a night for a 3 bedroom house
Incredible technology

Night

Also my Wi-Fi sucks. Get me out
They just don't see the big fucking cross I guess
They're goddamn heathens
The people in this cabin didn't get it
Nah he just needs to not wet nurse his fucking step son
You're the first one that recognized it as a crucifixion without me saying it
Those are like horse nipples
Bitch wtf
Bitch wtf
You like my contribution to the gingerbread house lmao
Cause it's been like fucking zero for two days
We're only here 2 days and I'm actually happy it's the last
Fuck it's so cold
Cause like despair stuns still give atk bar from second skill
Plus shi hou can be despair but shaina has to be vio
Yea but twins are busted for rift beasts. Especially dark which rn I suck at
So I need a different one for him
Yea I'm not building shi hou yet cause I want to save that vio set for her
Aka free win in pve with water boom
Fire chakram
Also cause shaina in a week and I need the thot
But I didn't so I'm not depressed to start the year lmao
I debated burning all my stones yesterday cause the nat5s this week are nuts 
Deadass think that it's more fun than smash
And float your ass with best thot rose
Train up to the number one spot
Listen buddy I'm gonna buy that game
I'll fuck you up Mario tennis tho
Xd good one
Didn't get my new years kiss 
Low-key sad I didn't go to the new years party
If I see him again I'm retroactively hitting him
My knees are fucking bruised from that kid tripping me yesterday
Cool
Well Christina wants our own room but I don't want to make you solo so since the car fits 5 we could find one more like Jerry or smth to room with you
Aslo I'm literally on a run rn. It's lit
Sweet. Also do you want your own room, invite someone else and share one, or share one with me and Christina
Up to you
Actually since jets not going we don't have to come back Saturday night we can stay till sunday and leave in the morning
I hate skiers 
And I fell 
Some ski kid cut mmr off yesterday
So the terrain sucks

i am but im stuck in class till like 7
And I want that Odyssey gem 
Augments yea but the final mission is beat hard mode with only 2
But Jesus fuck I want to grind that hard mode shit day one
If only we had gear drops too 
Holy shit those missions have me hyped
At 22
After a 1k spear hit
Literally q a brand for 1700 yesterday
85% nid win rate
But retard losses
Lol. The was a good win after
Noct nerfed to shit. Unplayable
I want ccool to be diamond ideally
I'd be down to do it another time tho. Just lmk when
Yea lol
1250 damage targeted q at 24 min
Milo. 3 S or S+ in 3 games. My only losses on her recently are still pop offs
Fucking rude dude
Yea
It was always when they were saying good job and stuff
Lmao. That's savage then
I've never once winked outside of conspiracy
Idk. What's the fucking reason
You ever realize how much old people wink. I got winked at by like three moms
Aight
But ya I'm off work finally. Gonna walk home and chill
All I asked was why he built cleaver over dusk lul
Will save my soul
League later
Help I'm bored at work. What do
So if you want you can take one or two for rp purposes and reasons
Well since he's from the old dynasty you should work in some cultural arrogance. Like they still believe they're the chosen people by the twins. They don't quite have as many sorcerers but it's not as rare as other places. It's more respected there than in alkathar where it's feared, since any warlord without a few battle mages isn't warlord long. And they still use magic for daily things, like a razor that never cuts the holder or a pot that purifies its water. They see it as a sign of civilization as opposed to barbarism without it. And as a samurai which is almost noble you'd be expected to know one or two of the utility cantrips like prestidigitation, mage hand, minor illusion, produce flame, control flame, etc
Did you finish your character back story
The new place is like a palace. Walled villa with a sauna, indoor and outdoor Jacuzzi, piano room, two four post beds, and a garden around it all. This is nicer than like the penthouse of most Vegas resorts and cheaper. Fucking love Thailand
Pool
The place I'm at has a pill that goes through/around the whole resort
All of them. It's so dumb
My dumbass family just wants to shop 
It's like a stereotype island paradise
Ya. I've drank more coconut juice than water while here
Thai. A little English and Mandarin but I can't understand or communicate shit unless it's at a touristy area
Skype wanted me to say what's the difference lol
Probably both tbh
Also. Customer service here is so much better than any place I've been in America. It's kinda nuts
Yea. Near fukhet there's some islands. I was on phi phi last night but on the way there we stopped by King Island and saw a ton of fresh af seafood
And these lobsters without claws
They have this prawn looking thing here that's like a foot long
They're fucking weird looking
I saw a basket of live mantis shrimp these people just caught
It's steak here too. I got filet and lobster
Well they'd also probably kick you out or not let you in
While team is all just in like shorts and tee shirts
You know what I love about Taiwan. Any college student like me can just mob into a five star hotel and for 45 dollars get a full five course meal and treated like a rich old dude
Doesn't opgg record your last ranked game in the tab and a date by it
I can't opgg myself rn
Before the 16th?
When was my last ranked game played
Groaned. Yikes. Here's my son groaned
True but does gemi mean anything in French
Lol. It's like making your kids name Tyrone 
That seems unconstitutional. Right under cruel and unusual
Also I like the name gemi. I named my farmer gem-i on the crystal cheese farm
Like a brother watched by the Warlock sister that keeps them in line. I thought it was super creative
I saw a cool character pair idea that I don't think anyone could ever pull. Or not of us anyway. But it was a tiefling child of one of the lords of the nine and a Warlock pacted to them
The tale of a samurai and his two thots
Hahhaha oh yea. I forgot Parsa and Mars were rolling women
Fair warning tho you guys know I like magic as a key part of the world and so 4 martial characters may struggle more gaining fame and reputation 
Yea. The castle is the justicar fort in ammnadel. It's south of falconrest, just north of the Capitol
It would be a good way to have him join the group tho
Having him know lysnader may be hard cause he's a young human raised in a castle as a holy knight lol
Damn sick 
Not bad. What did you roll for health
Ok. I think I talked to you guys about having all the New pcs be a group already. Just so the dynamic doesn't get as fucked as last time
When did the samurai get there 
Yea. He was north but not obviously anywhere in particular
Besides king ulariel alkathar who's notoriously difficult to gain audience with
Also I think it's logical that either he was there to see Prince Aleese cause rn were in his lands, prince merelth who's neighboring, or highprince alkathar because he owns the most plate and blade sets
You can come up with more leads. Stuff that would immediately raise suspicion if he heard or saw them
A few things he'd have brought with him that can start the trail are like a necklace of jade in the shape of the moon, a robe of crimson tougher than steel, a dagger of shimmering steel that pierces illusions, etc
Ok. You could flesh it out like he was seeking alkatharian allies because he owned no plate or blade of his own and sought to rise in power. But when he arrived he was killed along with his retinue
I think it's a naganata or smth thats a great sword
A katana is a longsword pretty much
He'd be sworn to a warlord or high noble
It's versatile so either
Yea that's kind of traditional to the dynasty
The old kingdoms are the lands of magic. Dwarves, gnomes, tieflings, dragonborn, and others all fight for it
Ok. The land is still guarded by the old wards that protect it from outsiders but without the celestials it fell into the hands of the high noble families that all complete for power, the only thing is that they still gather each year to hold back the fire plane and determine who the Lord of sun and moon will be for the year
The most feudal places would be the old kingdoms in the west or where the dynasty used to be
Yea. Any particular one
I love it. It's like 3k more for first class or 400 for exit which is nicer
That's the thing. You can consistently did this. It's nuts
Dude they let you choose that row now
No noise and no cram. Feels so good
Exit row seat with unlimited leg room and noise cancelling headphones is like sleeping at home
Also I think I've figured the best flight experience
Fair. Nobody's streaming tho
I'm never awake to know
Wtf do normies do before noon
So I arrived but it's 5am here
It's so strange
The three hottest girls I've ever seen have all been in an airport to or from Asia
Fine
I'm here
I'll get you first. 10 min
Roll or stat buy 
Ok. I don't mind
We're almost there. Come out
, yea we have a spot
See you in a bit
Aight we're on the way
Yea
Yea. Just waiting for Diego to come here
Yea he's coming
Lol. I didn't make him a contact so I have to figure which of a thousand contactless numbers is his I guess
I can't find it on my phone
What's Nathan's number btw
Unlucky
I can pick you up
Yea. I'm checking with Nathan and Diego 
I see. Yea I don't use them so you can
Did you get a PS
4. They're all old af tho
Probably. Why
Six ish. It's too early rn
Nah I'm home
Also I'm down for dinner if you are. Shinsen or Kula sounds so good rn
Holy fuck
Dude the movie was insane
There's no way unless he's ap
Trap 
Dude I want to try lethal tempo jhin
But honestly I'm done for today so I have time to get salty
I mean I was going to 
Tbh tho. Parsa is the exact kind of player the new system rewards the most and his play pattern is abhorrent
But I have a project so I can't talk about world lore stuff until later
I'm getting back from lab
Miles is on league voice or smth with him rn
Also he's gonna need help with how spell slots. Hit die. Rests. Etc work
He's brand new tho so we're starting level 1
Yea
I'm almost there. Few blocks
Were here
Meet me at the mall
Coming?
I'm outside
Almost there
Yea
750
Aight
I'm in your driveway
I'm good all day just message me when you're up
So I might bring the big tent too 
With less rains and snow 
Apparently the forecast for the valley is 30-50 and not 6-30
I'm walking
In 10
Bless I'm out early

ok go on disc
Fucking China ddos
Incredible 
im good
aight
but i gotta eat so in like an hour
i was gonna say play some cuck game
ay fucker
you wanna duck game or mc
then itll send &quot;Hey. We both know you can't play that champ. Dodge now and we won't ban you&quot;
i was thinking less positive but maybe if he plays a non milo champ
gonna look into it this week &amp; next
i havent coded anything but that should be easy based on their api docs
idea rn is a script that regularly sends requests to riot for if he goes into a game and texts him reminders like &quot;dont feed, dont be toxic, whatever&quot; but will ocasionally &quot;malfunction&quot; and text him these at like 2am too
and i want to build something to fuck with milo
and send texts
I got a dev account for riots API and for Twilio so i can hit both now to pull summoner/game/whatever data from riot
yo i need some ideas
tf
how
you wanna game
thatd be good too tbh
november come already
its poppin now. stormlight 4 100%
by 1 point lol
my second was skybreaker
bitch thats gay
lmao the feelings order
i really thought id have skybreaker or truthwatcher
whatd you get
elsecaller
i made the plantation literally just dump the food into fire lul
minecraft?
looks sick as fuck
done
well the house is pretty don
you wanna go on disc
milo and i are gonna mc after this game
well
you wanna pop on mc a bit
trapped a bunch of god tier librarians in a shack by the witch hut. including a mending nibba
though i realize im not all that creative at architecture
gotta join a meeting but i started a mc house
idk
maybe the others will have come back around or smth
i can roll with that when im less busy
and eventually consequences happen 
do whatever you want that week
i kinda wanted to do msm cause its pretty traditional dnd
if we ever do a campaign again you want to retry mission santa monica or do smth different
that hasn't gone great
i tried teaching him to code but
so idk why anyone wouldnt like it
like i said quarantine has been nice for me
ig. or to be away from his mom or smth idk
i dont have to put on pants and hang with my gf and cats and shit all day
i fucking love quarantine 
idk
but its pretty obvious
and hes just irritable and shit
no he said he wants to go outside more
the other is a faggot
one retard has depression and is lashing out cause of the quarantine 
just avoid milo and parsa
i could too
if they want
just too busy rn
and then get either collin or another random
i think after the project part of my fellowship is done in like 3 weeks ill see if miles or someone else wants to run a game
yea ik what you mean
if they get their hands on a staff or wand or smth
and honestly in a campaign with wizards allomancer is still busted
atium is insane
id honestly probably just increase flares by 1-2 and the allomantic ability either goes 3-6 or 4-5
it is short rest regen tho
its like monk where they should just have a few more uses of their abilities
idk why tineye is gained at such a high level
like i said this is surprisingly balanced
or like 34 on average
at level 5 thats 4d8+4x mod a turn
each coinshot is 2d8+2xmod
flare damage isnt bad
dont think allomancer even has to short rest
cause you can push and pull and riot and soothe without slots
idk basically having power all day long is really big
yea thats still huge
bitch even with 30 strength i dont think his standing jump is 20ft
also str doesnt do shit for ranged attacks
is just a mistborn campaign
whole world with only barbarians fighters allomancers maybe feruchemist sorcerer or smth
1 attack i mean
and the other to attack
you can use 1 action to coinshot push yourself up
and throw his weapons around
idk they kind of just hover above his range
this shit sucks against like demons and elementals
cause it doesn't take 200 damage to kill them like a barbarian or smth
and non-allomancers are literally level 5 at best 
like i said this is sick for a mistborn setting campaign where the majority of enemies are just commoners with weapons
but holy shit theres a lot of utility built in
actually this class just does no damage at all
but like i said you just have utility so move enemies instead of hitting them unless you go into thug
its a longbow
coinshot does 1d8+allomantic mod
and has no other utility
but runs out quick
it just has bigger spells and better melee than allomancer
which is also able to do good melee but also cast
oh actually the closest class comparison is hexblade
which would be fun with like 3 allomancers
imo it seems like its fair in combat but has a lot of out of combat use that you have to hard spec into
idk just being able to use coinshot/lurching whatever is pretty weak compared to like a paladin that can cast even half spells
it just means you can be a coinshot that stacks wisdom or charisma for socials
you never double dip
but if you go into physical stats you never use allomancy 
that scales on AA
which why would you if you have coinshot
and you don't use physical stats for like anything but melee attacks
instead of like +5-6 like normal
i don't see how. you don't have a main stat so early game your hit is +4 
ok fucko
ctrl+scroll
zoom in retard
this is kinda sick tho
the one with all the retards in it
yea i just gotta post a link
wait add me back to the main chat i got something i have to post
social distnace
shouldve just stayed the fuck home
its the dumbass protesters who wanted to do it here that are at fault for drawing the looters
tbh my only stance is fuck the police but fuck the looting chimps more
but rn i feel like i should be in the group chat triggering gwyn xd
well you basically got your answer to your first statement within it
loot any rare drops
how are you during the riots
yo
is milos birthday today or tmrw
omegalul
that works too
i mean i can be in the car and yell at you
lul
from a responsible distanc
if youre still in your place downtown ill pop over and say hi
anyway fuck them
which is incredible
not even parsa
and now that its out there i actually know that was the issue
and said hed rather play terraria
legit told him the whole shitstorm happened because he both cancelled on us last week
wasted enough time waiting for this
im gonna go help christina move out
tell milo to fuck himself for me
and people cant even pull that off
this was probably the last one for at least 2 months
the thing is idk if ill even have time
if nobody wants to then its doomed
idk i put too much into campaign to not run it but also
i tried that but
maybe its for the best
literally all started with milo blowing us off lasts minute and saying some shit so
idk what now
i told milo to go fuck himself
shit bitch
well
lmao ok
minecraft?
yea but its also that it extends outside his character
yea. you can drop your take too
obv
and tell jett like either care more or just sit out
i kinda want to talk to at least milo and miles and see how they feel
like if we bring collin in he was inherently good in gestalt
thats good. i think parsa out tho solves at least the second problem
but idk what to say to milo and miles about that to make them also want to do that
with like basically improved sessions
and just play out santa monica
i think basically what id like is just to drop parsa and get collin in
i mean at least in gestalt i kinda just stopped involving him
but the shitty parts are so prevalent
yea ik thats the good part
at some point
everyone else has at least had something good to say
im kinda settled in on like parsa not being in campaign if i run it
were so shit
but the last 2 weeks
and yea i like dnd and its probably the best part of the week
killed literally every bit of excitement i had
then trying to swap before session 2
but like parsa being negative right before session 1
dude im lost. i really liked everything that was built
but also cant stand doing like 10 hours a week of prep and shit just to have people not show up
i still want to run sm with them but like id rather have collin than parsa
idk what i want to do
i wasnt gonna do that anyway
maybe after my fellowship ill try again with these guys
yea i have a copy of it on r20
honestly fuck all of them
its just parsa and jett being faggots
or say anything positive
or read handouts
and i cant even get people to show up
im telling you theres like a few hundred hours of work in there
oh right. its all just under the old stuff folder
drop amonzako round 2
lul. if you ever want me to i can import shit from other games in still
so its completely pointless even playing
but even then nobody shows any actual interest
thats basically what i was gonna do
never once had parsa say anything good
so anyway fuck them. gl
like its 10x more work to put everything together and even then you cant get them to read shit
is that nobody cares. like the whole thing with parsa literally being negative all the time and then we wait for jett and milo only for jett to decide he doesnt want to play
so you see the problem with running for these people
so maybe you can get some use out of it
yet completely abandoning it is a shame since theres a lot of work in there
between parsas negativity in general and today i just decided i dont want to deal with this for a while
and i think youd do better with it than miles
would rather do other stuff with my free time
its too much work each week just for shit like people falling asleep or not showing
its close
r20 cant give the game fully but
you have dm on the alpira game now
Who knows xd
You know someone might know the alchemical recipes
Also you're tied with the monk anyway 
Yea. But it's fine you got more stats for dying xd
yea but if you die you wouldnt make a level 1
yea but if you die you wouldnt make a level 1
youd be the level of the lowest party member
sure if you want. i will say that the town is on the coast tho so any day trips are kinda stuck there
Right
Yea
ez
boat arrives with two notable passengers 
aight. i think itll just be first thing session
or the large albatross ship and you passenger
that you captain
you want it to just be a small ship with you and the guards, like light food supplies and ishi
also ishi is pretty sick
aight
Since it left before all the shit went down
Idc. You can bring like 3 bodyguards or some materials for the town. It's the last shipment so it shouldn't be vital 
if so then yea sure. guards over materials
are you important enough to have guardsmen dedicated to coming with you
Idc what really. Just that you get to arrive in town with the supplies and be all cool
Which crew do you want to meet essentially. And idk they'd probably bring food or lumber or people or smth reasonable
No like the boat is coming to drop supplies and one of the crew to see the town
and are they bringing settlers or supplies or what
like which of the 4 albatross crew is coming on this trip
since your character is coming on this ship i need you to pick some of the shit coming on it
ay
duck game?
yea ik thats why its so gay
cause he uses a bow
true lulw. also hes a paladin who uses a bow
yea. also helena only dislikes alain essentially
and 'hunting accident' his ass in the desert
or at least alain
cause like i was gonna have helena talk to ulmo and oogway and try to get them to turn on the ashina pair
is he connected to ulmo or loyal to him at all
im cool with either one
or like a dundee friend
would he be one of jun's political enemies hoping to take his place
well that makes sense
this particular hayasaki is like a 20th cousin of a 4th son or smth
its part of a different empire and its just a minor house no longer in control of an old outpost
its not bad. but isnt this house a little too minor to bother with
and then after winter they plan to come again and explore the island a little
drop off a few more settlers and some manufactured goods like rubber and shit
this mission is just a preemptive to come meet the mayor
also the ship the character comes on is called 'the albatross'. i made some of the crew available to you
yea sure. thats cool with me
its fun
bruh i spent a whole gnoll sheet to flame parsa
Aight sick
I'll give you details about the ship and shit later
I like it
Sick 
We'll see how the desert goes with her
They really should be. Her favorite enemy is humanoid
crazy bitch
yea now it just looks like youre making shit up or smth
so everyone else is at 10 now youre just at 8
i got rid of that from the sheet
lmao you know whats funny
start sessions off with some internal debate xd
like 'Azai wants to build a shrine to X'
im thinking of doing the townbuliding thing as like the government staff coming up and asking a couple questions at the start of sessions in town
true. its not like town economy wont be useful
its just a flare and a mini grenade lmao
smokesticks and thunderstone particularly
see now the shadow mechanics CAN help the group
cause it took so long
so this crafting thing doesnt go to waste
and take nature and herbalism kit/alchemist kit/blacksmith tools etc
true. ngl im hoping at least 1 or 2 of these goons take my offer to redo their backgrounds
oogway master
wise turtle
hes a monk now lol
like the secrets to leitnaught or the Beyond
she's big picture. she'd probably do it if it meant some knowledge was preserved
Lynelle isn't evil per se but she doesn't particularly care for any individuals and would definitely kill a child for the greater good
not the one I thought youd come to but good enough
lmao yea there you go thats one
not evil
mihara is a neutral god
makes sense. Do you know a powerful wizard of questionable morals
but you can tell me what your plan was
i was planning on finishing gestalt sometime
and also lived another 150 odd years
youre implying she somehow survived azure peak
oooh i like that
like an extra 2 4d6d1
but if you give me some really spicy shit ill let you roll better on the stats or smth
i gave you a backup sheet in case you wanna start working early
god that sounds kinda lit
but i guess one of you has to lose
well id hate to disappoint
i see
so how hard is the int. how quick is he gonna get found
so also the only alchemist by default
dundee is rn the only guy with nature proficiency tho lol
but yea alchemy is cool
is it really smart to tell the dm youre ready to die. thinking.
i literally put on the sheets that like if you come up with smth creative then we can balance it and make it a thing
yea all the crafting stuff is like a guideline
its definitely really strong
also those can be put on ammo so you deal arrow damage + those
and have it be a lingering fire
plus maybe when you make one you can add in like a sticky sap
is good
also 1d10 aoe as a repeatable action
because the sheet lists the basic versions of the items. like with healing pots if you come up with smth that fits like a very rare fireflower then you can create a better one
and the systems not bad. ties into the natural shit and at any point you can just say 'i think this should work in place of X' or 'I have these cool things, what can I make' and then we just make smth
i think crafting will be decently important since its not like theres premade magic items around the island
you have alcemist's acid for dot
which is cooler
like the 4e version
yea but its aoe
actually got this version from 4e
thats the base one
Alchemist's Fire
This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged Attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an Improvised Weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
ngl
i think the contents are pretty sick
or even keep it open
its not like you have to read it while doing anything on the page
its fine if it takes the whole screen
to just expand
i think its narrow enough now
close and reopen once more
as long as its readable
thats...fine i think
nah i want them to be able to just expand it horizontally and fit all
i made it significantly narrower
close the sheet and reopen?
i made it narrower
what
that fix it?
how much can you see up to
how much too wide is it
since the table is like 2/3rds the width of mine
yea. importantly the known formula sheet may be too wide for your monitors
can you look at the sheets under added rules and make sure everythings clear and makes sense
gonna sleep pce
ill talk to you when i have more done after i de-tilt
just cant be too smooth off the bat imo
like if its right away 'i need guards to patrol' and everyones agreeing then like say you need them to find herbs or smth idk
i kinda need you to either try to moderate the extremes or be one of the opposing sides
not like what 'arc' youre gonna have at some point
yea exactly thats what i was telling parsa that your backstory should really matter more in how you interact with the others and what you want to see happen
and someone else would take an opposing stance and try to talk the mayor into their plan
i imagine one person would want the town guard to be doing smth for them or maybe town money to fund a project
then jump right into them rping a breakfast at the tavern
thats sorta the plan. little 2 minute 1 on 1 with each townie
if you have anything particular i can just ask you the question you want
like maybe the new guy likes you cause you prepare him local herbal teas that are really just light drugs
so like idk have some ideas
then for non-governor pcs ask shit like 'hows your relationship with the mayor / what do you think of him / what weird habits' type shit
and having them improv a conversation or story or whatever
anyway ik youre probably better than the other goons at improving shit so i was gonna start session asking each player starting with milo about how they got to this island
that fucker manages to turn what should be constructive criticism into just criticism
fuck parsa
sleep yea
cause theres logical consequences in this game which i feel like i didnt do in gestalt
one of the two
and exiled or hunted
are you prepared to switch if he rolls poorly and gets caught
makes sense
so theres a tug of war with this young manipulatable governor
the atmosphere i envisioned was that everyone has their own thing they want town resources for
i mean im fine with that tho
very cool
actively searching out a sword left by nilgesh
it works
yea but hey
and find a weapon to beat their hexblades
as in genichiro wants to revolution against the tiefling hierarchy
yea but like theyre tied in well
and writing good world-tied in backstory
its weird that miles is the one consistently reading everything
so like why the fuck do we play with them
and ik like milo and jett havent read shit either
i think the most tilting thing is him just talking about how hes not invested in the world or story
lmao yea go eat some guards or farmers
oh wait the creatures journal?
idk how any of those plants have to do with blood drinking but ok
im assuming its drugs
i think i left the players thing on a sheet with a big middle finger drawn
my excitement to run this went from like 90 to 10
thats good
well at least one of us is
i mean i dont even know peoples expectations
like what tho
and idk. i feel like thats a dick move coming into a game with expectations and i dont think anyone else does
and this whole point about expectations and shit
and he insisted like 'kevin had all the pcs rp the moment they left town' 
like i wanted to start session 1 just cold open everyones at breakfast a few months into working together and people rp
its mostly just unhelpful bullshit like suggesting smth and i just say i dont want to and him doubling down on it
like yea i probably did go overboard with the details but i like it and it makes me feel like theres an actual world
every time we play league or smth he brings up things i 'should' do in campaign and it tilts me to no end
fuck that guy
or into kicking parsa
fucking amazing that i havent even started the game and im already tilted out of it
i invited
the fuck
disc
duck game?
get back in disc so we can talk
get in here
hey bitch
im bored of writing
you wanna duck game an hour
hmm
: )
Hunter's Lore. You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.
and
Cunning Artisan. As part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a javelin, or 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate artisan's tools, such as leatherworker's tools.
you get
maybe not enough to speak with it or see through its many eyes but enough to tap their instincts
like even a lizard stolen away as an egg is still somewhat connected to the Unity
but would still retain this trove of knowledge
but some break free by choice or by chance and pick up a different culture
my homebrew thing going for the lizardfolk is theyre all born as part of the Unity and therefore share its ancestral wisdom
how to hunt, how to gather natural resources, how to use them to craft things
i mean if hes a lizardfolk he has an innate affinity for the land
really bad at distributing them or smth
good at hunting and gathering resources
not much about the other
knows a lot about one aspect of the job
yea thats kinda the point
and making sure the town doesnt broke
in charge of you know. town resources. money, stockpiles, etc
sure. just simplified out to resources advisor maybe
its ambush hunting
sticking with the tiefling hierarchy social structure
well anyway. town will have a japanese name. same empire as rei built and her descendants are the ruling family
thats still hunting

&lt;&lt;&lt; </legacyquote></quote>shit mb. forgot theyre herbivores
lulw
yea but crocodile in charge of game
fish and wildlife division is danker
i thought youd say fish and wildlife
and how did he get there
what was he the advisor to the old mayor of
no objections. ok
but part of that empire
no youre on an island south of it
and instead of it being alera vivendria writing the text for all the handouts/character sheets itll be lynelle
town probably wont actually be santa monica
jin divide and splinter into 3 warring states led by 3 remaining god-warriors and the emperor and his loyalists flee to their little land east of arentia
you'll be part of the Vrucurian Empire established by Rei and exploring/settling the Gigantia island between Decimur and the shield isles
year will be 198 Serpentfall, or 198 years after the end of this one
actually put real work into next campaign and ive finally settled on at least some decisions
wack
aight its time
duck game later. milo and shit
discord
idk
duck game or aom
game
and made me copy paste it
and diego linked her twitter in the chimpest way possible
thats the bitch we played with

disc
i got like 20 minutes before i gotta sleep
aight you still here
fuck parsa tho
nah kevins cool
so no
ah ok
anyone cool or
im finishing a league game with diego
with who
duck game
like 8 or 9
you got any hard times set with milo and jett
ok i did remember. lit
oh right
ok so it is the gloves
i have no idea
so shes just gonna send him a bomb
jett wanted smth or other but he also tried to get hades to attack her
think it was winter gloves or smth
i forgot him and jett but at least jett i had a free out. she just sent a fuck you letter cause he tried to sic hades on her
do you remember what kaede wanted from mihara
you doing session later?
aight lmk
you wanna duck game or league rq
nah i was testing a voice changer
for like 5 minutes
yo you wanna help me test smth
so every time the oath is broken i can just decrease the con by 1
idk. i just changed up the staff slightly to give more con less charisma
whats lucia need tho
might make it stronger in compense for how easy it is to lose the staff's power tho
essentially lawful good
it does force him to behave a certain way
ok i made a version of the dawnstaff under the relics list. you can look at it and tell me if it seems too op for lucia. its strong but imo not better than durendal once lautrec gets the rune or leitnaught once its returned
20 weeks of paying a 9th level wizard
giants is dank
you want it to be in the city? I was thinking of going back to the giants or the northlands or smth
also everyones already sworn to help yumiko
yea. i think itd be fun just rolling over some petty problem
right
you mean how arentia is doing
not directly to carim
i was thinking next session is some time during the break anyway
yea true
or just wait a few sessions
should i say everyone's 12 rn
ok another thing. i feel like with the items the party is at people should be higher level but skipping levels is kinda blueballs too
unless you want him to go back
silas would be just a judge or other court official of some small town likely
you wont try to talk her out of it
im working through events and not time so during the conquest of Nihon so here goes. 
~6 1/2 months in, Silas ends up crippled in a battle. His hands are cut off and Rei offers to send him home with gold or grant him a small village and estate in Nihon. He wants your opinion
-Natalie proves herself a capable commander and ends up one of Rei's advisers. 3 weeks after the silas incident, Rei decides to make a point about changing the social structure of the isles and offers Natalie the hexblade, Fatecarver, one of the originals given by the Raven Queen. Natalie wouldn't be part of the petty or the guild and would be one of the empire's high nobles. she's pretty much set on a decision but will take input anyway
aka level 13
i may have been too vague with ra talking about the 'first people' but basically they became the gods in the first era and at the end of the war with nilgesh capped mortals at a certain level of power
also the petty has been levelled a bit. up to like 5 which places them pretty high up in terms of stuff they can do
sleeping off the rona now
alright. ill get to you tmrw
and you back to his underling xe
and hes the guy whos likely to do so anyway so youd leave and come back to nathaniel running things 
and itd be easy for him to unseat you
well the danger in that is the guild knows him
yea but whos managing the guild when you go to carim
possibly. more importantly youd need a second to manage the guild while youre away tho
fucking sticks
l m a o
duck game 
ofc
fuck did you do lol
?
poof
no
yea i ended up with red for fire
whered my character sheet go
add charisma mod to fire damage spells
its the dragon sorc feature
theyre spells
wait nvm its in the phb specifically
aight. also cantrips are spells for elemental affinity right
am i captain or an npc or whats the deal
and more fitting a mage
elemental one is cooler
im assuming we're travelling on this ship
even better xd
gives you a reason to spam the call
should do a session 0 tonight or smth
fair
i might swap synaptic static for teleportation circle if those are gonna be a thing
lmk about the ship. also i got all kinds of elemental resist lmao
lets fuckin go
aight. also idk shit about the eberron setting or races so
did you tell anyone else
gl getting all the maps and writing in xd
but im down to run tonight. no other plans
now i think it is
see after you said no april fools shit
ok go
bo3 internet maps only lets go
little duck game
actually skype
disc
duck game?
yea. im at like complete block in writing rn
im just chilling in one of the other discord rooms
check it out. i think its pretty decent
fuck talking to parsa
you wanna talk about some shit for next campaign. i got no ideas rn so
ay come discord
lmao
next campaign is cosmere
ill figure it out lol. 24 hours ez
ok. i can try to come up with something
some econmic activity
i mean what were you looking for in avaris
cause nobody else wanted to drop by for long
also seems like avaris will be a short stop
yea its solid. i need to write shit tonight but i have some good ideas
tru lulw
can idle the time lul
only a year
lol. once you have leitnaught itll be ok
lol
aight. one magic weapon at least
you could pay 2 casters 5k each and the hearts and have a d3 within 2 months
or more casters
enchantments are slow work
youd need a year for a d4
2 months is only enough time for a very minor enchantment. youd be looking at like yea 1 maybe 2 damage
also what exactly is the enchantment doing. cold damage, cold resist, etc
the one time anyone wants to see the guy
hanneman is occupied with kaede actually
sure. do you know a spellcaster or are you contracting it out
enough time to work a very minor enchantment into an item
2 months
it wont count as a magical weapon tho
which will prove much cheaper to acquire
any name would count as long as the intent is there. it wouldnt need to be aluminum tools then if you arent weaving other magic into it. plain mythril will be hard enough to shape it
i was under the impression it was magical
are you forging a plain infernal steel rapier
Are you gonna tell the party about his rune and vampirism
except mythical metals like radiant gold
like its by far the most expensive metal in this world
aluminum tools are gonna be both expensive and hard to procure. you pretty much need to find a mage or a supplier who knows a mage powerful enough to scrape it from inside volcanoes
still need a smith tho
yea. 100 plat will do tho for the summoning
the rules are the rules ig
idk where a fucking rapier is 2 lbs but
sounds about right
yea
not all servants of Nilgesh use the same methods. she personally served him by destabilizing kingdoms and spreading chaos and freedom. the Glooms do so through infection and shadow cabals. they kidnapped mace and other orphans to attempt to inscribe them with ancient and corrupted runes. after that, the survivors were turned into vampires and forced to work for them. she stole mace and a few of the others away but couldn't revert them to human and so they were locked up by the hresvelgs
since the petty hasnt done much in a while, they break in to the hresvelg prison to find Mace and instead report that they saw only a monster in the cells. red pupils and long talons, skinnier than any man could be yet strong enough to rattle a pure adamantite cage. Skeletal wings and pale flesh. It tried to control them with a piercing gaze. They take a couple of weeks to recover after what they saw. Yumiko sends a letter the following week that only says, &quot;Are you sure you want him free?&quot;
ok i gotta go. get the game and play the 1.5 hours youre allowed to before refunding xdx
and the nemean lion
you can hunt like the thessian hydra
actually there are monsters too
greek &gt; egypt
looks coool
although i am  just a huge fan of ancient greek shit so wandering around is cool
plux alexios is a total fucking chad
and fantasy gameplay beyond button mash
got boat shit
its solid
tbh id get odyssey for 20
me chad as fuck
me warrior man
no bullshit assassinations only
no forced trailing mission bs
fuck that part of 3 and 4
yea theres been no modern people gameplay so far
personally i just spec warrior
or mix
you can spec warrior assassin or hunter
leans into the fantasy shit
this one is solid cause its more magic than the others
like literally exploding arrow
theres a lot of more typical rpg shit
yea theres a big ass aoe arrow
and use abilities to just aoe
spec warrior
if you dont like the combat you can turn it to easy
yea lmao
the dlc aint bad
base game probably good enough but
yea lol
still less than the base game xd
so like 40 bucks for it
i got it with the extra shit tho
worth af
yea i got it sale
mostly i hunt cultists and animals and shit
its fun
but if you sidequest it up
its like a solid rpg mixed with dumb quests
gathered op gear from it
gravity deals the damage
just making them run up a ladder then kicking
ive killed like 10 elites at least 8 levels up on me so far
nope lmao
or stand on top a ladder and kick for damage
to one shot elites in naval fights
spartan kick off boats
i just like cheesing kills tho
theres skill now
its good
rn im sleep
ill post his hextech arm tmrw when im done
he'll owe you one back
maybe if you procure him the tools
which the omnismelter provides half of
working with it requires aluminum tipped tools and access to supremely hot hellfire
yea
or have bamdul do it
youd need to know a capable artisan tho
theres a handout
otherwise im gonna sleep
im tired af. dm me on skype if you guys do smth fun
xd
well ok i guess
yea but why study
just google the questions
well thats retarded hes at home
ur turn
ok i harassed them
shit idk. we can harass milo and jett into duck game or league
idk. pbe or smth
game?
damn b
ok boomer
more wack game?
solid intuition
thatd work
ig if you found another circle then you could go back to varavhik and drop 500 miles to the south and end up there
cause cagliostro's runestone was bounded to the giant city in the sky, the library at Varavhik
do any of you know the teleportation circle spell
and the clan heads are incompetant and short sighted
the other 2 have power but no talent or drive
rei has the willpower and the talent but needs a real weapon
nathaniels tldr is he thinks that of the 3 real contenders for the throne of nihon
so yea. thats what she hears back from daggercourt
yep. in and outta that ho and town
virgin birth
well ooc its fairly obvious
oh shit youre right. i forgot about that
or any possibilities whose timelines match up
as per usual. also does penny really not know the doctor
he needs the rune of saint carius
lautrec needs a specific metallic one but yea
and who lack the academic knowledge to know what you come out as
right but theres shadier operatives who will throw you into the machine
or he really did purposely hide it
its possible he never knew the nature of his rune
:thinking:
yea. whats penny gonna think or do
Ok boss. Natalie and Gale got into a Hresvelg overseerâ€™s room and read his records. They caught your buddy using a Rune on a dock master to get his promotion. Normally thats just part of the game. But get this, he used a Metallic Rune. Your boy is either saintsblood or killed someone who was. Apparently the Pale Assassin herself caught the guy and spilled his secret to the Hresvelgs. They made damn sure nobody on that ship would talk after that. They tried to get some doctor to take it out but the power overwhelmed him. After that they moved him around from city to city, hoping to find a place where it would be safe to remove but no luck. Heâ€™s back in the city, under their manor now. Eliotâ€™s looking for the old guard captain so he can try using his golden sword to cut it out.

consumed or she dual wields. who knows
blades like moonsliver are powerful imitations but not originals
there are 9 original hexblades given by the raven queen to the tieflings following the fall of Vrucuria and them sailing to Hakone
the most any family has is 1
9 blades, holding 4 is basically a majority
and combined theyd only be a little stronger
that controlling nihon would mean no other island is as powerful
thats one interpretation. i think he's just mostly commenting on the nature of the island's power balance
basically he just writes to oberlyn in case the spanreed gets intercepted
xd
right
it is right
yea sure
...
Lady Ordelia,

I hope this communication finds you unharmed and its seal unbroken. My nephew, Chikusa, has told me tales of his home in Hakone. A violent and wartorn place inhabited by those inclined to both darkness and order. Amazingly, they have no kings in those lands. Not since the days of the Satsuo empire before the fall of Vrucuria, anyway. 
As with any lands, there are many who desire the burden of rulership. Simple ambition does not a shining star make. That said, Chikusa has told me of but a few who may truly see their ambition realized. The island of Nihon holds four of the nine true Hexblades in the hands of its four clans. Only one other island possesses multiple, and even then it is the smallest possible multiple. 
I hear that Lady Hayasaki is of singular talents. Her weapon may not be the mightiest in the lands but her conviction and skill are truly unique. The clan heads see their single island as the world and are content to fight endlessly for control of it. Lady Hayasaki sees the world beyond. Her rivals are not those who are currently in power, but rather the others of similar capability and drive. 
Kazou Tama, first son of the Tama house in western Nihon. Yamada Ichi, warlord of Nara. They are the ones you should be wary of if you seek to manipulate the Hakone Throne. For what it is worth, my coin lies on the Lady Hayasaki even if her rivals wield true Hexblades. Their power makes them complacent and arrogant. Power that comes from a blade is power that can be matched. The fire of a soul is one that cannot be kindled.

Nathaniel.
aight
Its not really dangerous but its more of an &quot;are you sure you want to know&quot; type thing
this wouldve been the letter they sent on the first week
Hey boss, we did some investigating around on your pal Mace. Hresvelg folk made him captain of â€œThe Conwayâ€ and let him sail into their personal harbor before dragging that whole crew into the cells and sinking the ship. I ainâ€™t accusing him of anything but the Hresvelgs wouldnâ€™t waste valuable gold like that without real good reason to. All the other crew came out wonky, half of them jumped from silver bridge and the only one who would talk is madder than a hatter. You sure you want us to keep digging?

-Chip (Penned by Lawrence Hagan)
Sure. I'll write it up
It may be a larger plot than offing an old man
Maybe he's a skilled rogue. Maybe he's an avatar of the Other spinning global webs. Maybe he doesn't exist. Who knows
btw. i put up a sheet about the Whispering One and some interesting tidbits. Apparently rumors may be there is more than one Whispering One running a web in the dark and a host of other possibilities. Knowing what penny does about the entities she can draw her own conclusions about the validity of such claims
considering you need azure peak allies anyway
but we'll see if you guys come around 
ik milo swore to not hurt her planning for everyone else to do the betraying
plus we have all this new shit now
yea. doesnt always work oiut
tbh after we went adventuring modes runes lost their real purpose. next campaign theyll be more like dragonmarks
also her sheet defaults to query whisper. if you want you can always whisper the rolls to me
major doesnt chain btw. its only ever 1 extra even if you kill 2
use the major's passive to make 1 more
kill someone
yea. best case scenario she can use her minor to make 1 extra attack
her major is a demonic gift
her minor is her natural rune
bc her demonic boon and shit
trust me i made her runes weaker than yours
yea but the spell specifies the attack action limits to 1
as per the spell
haste action is 1 attack
might as well have him kill you for it
lautrec has a minor already
her major is unusable by anyone who isnt a follower of her demon because its his boon
ig. theres a lot of better minor runes tho
3 slots. major counts as 2
the only person with slots left is bamdul/kaede
1 major 1 minor
bitch no you don't
her minor rune is a worse version of your mino
wait her runes are literally worse than yours
yea that was the point
is e d g y
cause its not homebrew its just modified xd
i did them already and got rejected each time but like now i feel less weird about it
also theres a whole section on ToF about demonic boons
also her minor rune lets her give herself a Haste action once per short rest. Major rune passive gives a single extra attack if she kills a creature during the attack action
core fighting style will stay the same. just play her as a little more sadistic in combat. like if she can she'll draw out a kill or smth. 
ok nvm i thought it over and rei should count as evil. planning on conquering your homeland for personal glory is evil. mordenkainens has rules for demonic gifts too so im gonna redo her a bit
Cause fuck kids who go to tas for help
Yea probably. Will see during my lab tmrw
ig
needs time
didnt flesh her out as much as the warlock and thought she was less interesting
i might just stow the paladin for later
T r u e
T r u e
That's getting clear
Yea ik. In character I think people will incline to the assassin
Opposed to the weaker paladin with team buffs and shit you knows
The hexblade is stronger but she's a really selfish build
Lmao. I guess we'll see. I need to flesh both out some more
Little teenager boy with a saints relic
You don't like lautrecs image
need thoughts
still working it all out
opposed to the assassin who utilizes fear and her status to order people
all charis so people like and listen even if she's not eloquent or wise
i think the paladin has a less forceful personality but wants to see a world at peace
thats like most of the crime in hakone
i mean if youre after killers she knows those
weirdly no. she was trained by a blood-cult and has a hexblade but doesnt engage in criminal activity past you know, murder
the hakone girl is a self-centered noblewoman bent on revenge
and is your typical paladin type
the paladin i think is this naive girl who was sent by the church on a suicide mission because shes a threat to their power or smth
damn you caught me. arentia is just 'murica
both of the other 2 are native to this world at least. and around 19-24
can be lynelle + 1, just 1, or none
who do you think people would take with them in the party to find leitnaught. lyenelle, an arentian redemption paladin girl, and a Hakone hex-assassin noblewoman
skribblio?
until like 6
cause im on campus at sc while christina does work
are you at your place
ay you doing anything
league
ay nice
just in case though. i cant trust it to like jett
you <b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">might</b> deal with a doppelganger thing
but ill take it off visible
so the token reflects the health on the sheet
technically theyre both you
Just like a total clusterfuck thing
Do you think you could rp as both a creature imitating penny and trying to get the party to kill the real penny. And also real penny trying to convince the party she's real while the fake attacks. In a way that doesn't give away which is real right away
im with that
league or smth?
call
get in
wtf
wait it auto types that
Give me a call when you're back.
get in. milos home and shit
been studying all day and i want to die
wanna get people for skriblio
theres others in the stories like ta'anari
is it too scuffed to just name the ascendants the same as they are in the shurima stories
yea but when you shoot downhill you shoot straight
but irl arrows are really fast
thats cause scenes with arrow rains make them slow as fuck
so just give them gats and let them spray and pray
goblins cant aim or shoot all that hard
which is the goal right
theyre good for an army and bad for individuals
true. i dont hate the homebrew guns either
or once with a 1d10 rifle
yea but you could attack twice with a 1d8 bow
thatts fine but the damage is only like d2 higher
xd
guns are essentially half-range bows who need to be reloaded every some amount of attacks and also break
also did you ever see the gunslinger class homebrew
you learn more about the entities, what they do, their relics
narrative
its good tho. good background listening
they have like 15 each focused on a specific fear like the Hunt - fear of being prey, the Flesh - fear of body horror, etc
but anyway i was listening to it and they kinda yoinked my idea about entities
with overarching lore around the institute 
its a podcast of supernatural stories and shit
did you ever listen to the magnus archives
and needs crystals or some other macguffin to fire
idk yet if i was going the powder route or making it a gift of some entity
shorter range, loading property, need to train proficiency, loud, but more damage than an arrow
btw guns arent gonna be strictly better than other ranged weapons
Mundane clothing isn't expensive. A 2500$ coat is like 10g right. So 3 25k dresses only comes to 300 and that'd be pretty top of the line
Ok as long as you know what you're getting
Right but 10% x 3d6 bonus is 1 damage higher per round average
Which is interesting
Mathematically. Even on a 1d12
Funny enough tho the crit increase is less dps 
Yea I think. My memory isn't perfect but it sounds right
It'd cost 2k in materials and all thorvalds time for the rest
thorvald could smith it to a weapon tho so acquiring enough of the steel would be ~5k
a lot. unless you have the metal it has to be conjured from the nine hells through a bargain with a devil
game
dam
i wanna get your opinion on smth
league and talk
yea bitch
game?
get on
you are
you looking to play league or ror
Yea I guess. Dudes weird
and kicked him anyway
we kinda changed the campaign to what he wanted
you ever want to reinvite parsa for a session or smth
make sure to warn your guests never to look at the mirror in the great hall
ah yes the mirror of soul trapping booby trap
and not the dagger or the hilt
whyd you pick the mirror btw
but he afked both
he shouldve had like the pen sword or the hilt
but better than a nothing weapon
which isnt really op
yea but i gave her a cool weapon from bamduls mom
cause she has rage
i might go nerf his sister shes probably impossible to 1v1 for a barb
idk if he intends to even be enemies with them or allies
the village
surprise attack what
which should be a big thign
but they jumped right into the orraak village
sure but rn everyone wants to be done with the north right
dunno if i should make each event longer
i feel like the pacing of our sessions is really fast. like theres 2-3 big events each time but if we slow down im worried we'd get nowhere
oh yea. i have a great idea for a travel thing similar
supposed to be aasimar yea
in a throwaway line
supposed to be. gomir talked about the children of celestia falling to earth
also the aasimar falling to earth
the Others/the invasion - goblins and guns, pennys friend as a hresvelg captive, lynelle's quest to capture the last mask, the azure peak, the doors to the planes now open atop a beanstalk, etc
i think they know
or theyll get sick of penny running the show
or bonus income and ability to buy magic items
like leads into shit
maybe the bonuses of it will be enough
yea thats what i remember
yea i figure you hear rumors just by default
just to make it decent
fair. you can gather miscellaneous info passively tho
i remember reading that in the book
also the establishment gets rumors right
the fused come and fuck you up
Aight sick
And allies to call
Fair. You have things to sell anyway 
You guys were earning him like 2.5k a month or smth
You'll get your share from morozov too 
Yea ofc 
Instead of tracking
If you want the petty can do more thieving and rigging bets and shit
And the state
Pretty much yea. To Nathaniel and the guild
thats unlucky
chips in prison tho
well pennys officially noble now
oof chip tho
instead of having to show it to a duke's eye first
will be assumed to have been procured legally
but things like ancient relics and shit
well not things that have deeds but yea
yea essentially you can sell things legally and unless someone can directly prove ownership its assumed to be legit
on the trust you have a right to them, without needing proven inspection
also means you can directly sell goods acquired through unknown means
but you legally own it instead of renting it from the crown
ok then the tax is 350gp/month for the establishment
or as a merchant you pay less tax but have less protections and privilege
you get the benefits of nobility but pay the full tax
or just as a merchant family
also you have a choice now of paperwork. you can file house Penny as a noble house as she does own land and has 2 noble sponsors
you can count just an establishment as castle level .5
yours to pay taxes on your part
yea its morozovs duty to pay taxes on his estate things
oh right. its just 1k/level i think
should be in just 2 handouts
% wise
just cant remember what your arrangement with morozov was
and i have all the estate stuff marked myself
i think only the establishment is personal
like the apothecary should be estate but the establishment is personal
also seperate whats personal investments and whats estate
its been a long time in the north
~2.5
ok cause im not tallying shit not on the sheet towards party gold
along with their incomes and shit
you have all the assets on the sheet right
wdyt people will want to do next
xd
cause rn i only have like 4 leads and no flesh
end of next session yall can talk out where to go next
its ok. idk how long you guys plan to stay in DC but i think down time is chill
but that there are others, ones who were here longer and under similar cirumstance 
finding out the god who summoned him here is dead, leaving him potentially without a way home
shouldve been a bigger moment for him
yea. so is kaede kind of
i guess its just lynelle now
exactly. i feel like end of last session was kinda rushed tho. i meant for the council to be more important and more allies
not like a do or die
i think the duel is more like a bonus objective. win it and get her weapon. lose and join up with the tribe
sneak is like 3
zealot damage is only 1d6
he'd have to pop off hard
shes zealot/battlemaster tho
if he rolls well enough
more likely to lose but has a chance to win
yea i figure hes gonna try to challenge his sister
rip jett
yea. gonna try to make the orraak shit short then
seems like everyones ready to go back to thaeron to recoup and shit
but thats less likely
or milo can just use the hourglass
gonna make it so learning about the demon is somewhat in the story path
it be like that
yea
her and xargrul actually
and their theme so
but it helps to come up with who the character is
even though itll never come in handy
funny enough all i did so far was stat her out
thats driving the goliath to extinction
i was going to tie it in to the seemingly endless civil war between orraak and loronath
ik but i have another idea
as well as the others
idk. i think next session i want to touch on the puzzle box and xargrul
shes still evil because she wants to continue nilgesh's dominion of the world, but not end it
but i figured her main motive is actually stopping the other entity
i was gonna make a handout about the Others that keep getting mentioned but ill figure some other way to do it
shes not just resentful at the world and doesnt need to kill all things
she has her own goals and her own ideas of good
idk. i didnt want her to be too much like lilith
collin is good tho, wish we had him from the start
anyway. not having parsa makes it so i can do wackier shit but he also listened to the background shit at least
im down to talk any shit
which is tilting
also i feel like only you and collin listen to the lore and milo just says dumb shit usually
im bored as fuck and on laptop
idk talk or play some shitty trackpad game
you looking to
you doing anything
go back to yelling at kids to get off your lawn
ok boomer
want to round up goons for scribblio
ay im bored
but that may make it easier
i mean youll miss the dank part
bitch wtf
dont be late fucker
Aight cool. Didn't want to make the climb a huge thing
But yea. Probably like 930-945
Well it's for something at the top
if not i need to put way more before it
you think you can get home by like 930 fri<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1579125160917" ts="1579125160" t="61"></e_m>
you think you can get home by like 930 fri<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1579125160917" ts="1579125160" t="61"></e_m>
theres one part of campaign i need penny for
leg
le
league
leage
leagu
league
fuck
im gonna get on my smurf
ayyyy
ay yo league
With mix
Maybe 3 days no activity or 7 days light
cause rn i have to homebrew stronger things cause everyone always has their resources
the point is to be able to run more default mons
my personal leaning is 5 days with mix
cause 3 is short imo
were you the 3 days vote
just go vote
which one is first
so like every week or two of travel, once resources are out, you need to stop and break
im leaning towards the second one
wdyt. 7 days of light activity = long rest or 3-5 days of no activity = long rest
seems good to me
ok 2 votes for it
slash complete a long rest
every 7 days you get spell slots back
its literally just no 1-hour short rests. each night is a short rest instead
so wdyt about changing the rest system
its weird being old
so i dont have to make sheets manually
also im somehow getting to the age where im lazy enough and have the money to buy the mm and shit on r20
about the rest change
im guessing you dont care
brb
im gonna write
which is better
actually i have a third plan
but that was maybe too troll
and youve just been shrunk
but then you realize eventually this is the morozov castle
but i had this troll idea where you emerge in a castle filled with truly titanic creatures 100x your size
tbh ive pretty much settled in on a giant's castle cause thats classic
except get shit out and sprout
the beans dont actually do anything when fed
ik but everyone else voted for it
i guess thats how that works
but its lit up there
it does go all the way into the clouds
ye. in any case tho going up the vine is a journey in itself
hes like 100ft up there
hey caedes already on the way up
no shit
but now i cant cause i dont want to prepare that many possibilities
cause i was going to have it fractal into vines leading to all planes
so i probably shouldve made everyone climb the beanstalk at the end of last session
That's nuts
That's nuts
True
That's not that op
Yea ik
I don't get it
What
Lol aight
K
?
Aight. Will roll and see how it goes
Aight. His plan is hire thugs to protest the church and hit it when the guards leave the chapel
maybe a minor magic heirloom
and try to get some art or gold 
alternatively the petty can hit a small house
to you
he said he needs 200g up front for costs then he'll decide a sell price after
that fits perfectly into the shiny spear morozov has behind his desk
its a stone
but chip says he has a lead that the church has something morozov would really like
and everyone else's which is to find some minor house to rob
theyre split between his choice which is hitting the church
nah nobody agrees with chip that he should hit the church
but it do be like that
or really likes him
nobody agrees with chip
and they havent hit any big marks in a while
also chip notes in particular the archbishop is out of town
anyway thats the info they have from the last month
lmao
tim the enchanter
youve met many wizards
part of why morozov is looking to acquire a wizard/enchanter
its on the rise yes
its been slowly returning to other parts of the world
and while the assassin's shattering of the oculus has broken daggercourt's monopoly on magic
every house wants to buy any magic items they can to protect themselves or send with their children to war
but there are business opportunities as welle
nah the party is too high status to be drafted
nice reference lol
but divine portents point towards a bloody war on the kingdom's hands
yumiko went back to her homelands to negotiate
they blamed the kingdom and seized a lot of their assets and imprisoned people in their lands, slightly south and far west of where you are for reference
but their ship was attacked by rogue agents and disappeared
finally, apparently the jin empire was supposed to send an emissary down south to improve relations and forge an alliance
and knows many spells but can't innovate or scribe them down. the knowledge is somehow innate
hes been trying to get another arcanist tho since vyrmias is remarkably bad at enchanting
theyre converting vyrmias's tower to a full on wizard tower and morozov got into the alchemy business selling that shit for war
the estate is doing well after the villagers arrived to work the land
they appear to be of slightly above average height but slightly thinner than humans. They use shadow magic and seemingly warp through the dark mists
besides the firearms though, a few survivors have reported hooded mages among enemy lines though there are very few people who survive seeing them
and making a killing
but is apparently doing pretty well moving goods and troops
he was ordered to reinforce the troops south while the rest of the kingdom gathers for war
other info about the city is that the invasion in the south diverted joe riegan
She was upset at that, telling omega that she needs it to finish her work. Omega claimed to have a lead, that water would remember where such ancient things were held, but he had to await its return. the petty left after she said she would handle the gatherings/
Finally, they caught her talking to Omega through an enchanted mirror where he was surrounded by the corpse of a cloud giant and his minions. he told her that the giant hadnt been able to give him the location but that he knew it to be in the northlands
when they interrogated one of the thralls it talked about how only Pure Silver could form the Runes, and something about &quot;sticks and water&quot; 
one particular group was mining in a seemingly abandoned mine suspiciously close to where vladimir morozov and adrian loren sacrificed his son and created the death knight
she looks frayed now, like she hasnt slept in weeks and carries a new artifact. a chain holding amethysts that wraps around her fingers and palm, like a soulcaster. she also has thralls working around the forest, elves and humans with glazed over looks
they spotted syvana in silverpine after following a burned trail clearly carved by glorfindel
since ive been ignoring the petty a bit im gonna give you their last month's info
Aight one sec
That's fair
Lol
Let the uber think you're nuts
True. Do that then
Than big plot shit
That's fine I'll try to do other stuff
Phone's gay

ig we will see
any decent wizard can DD and counterspell
i mean lucia doesnt have counterspell tho
unless you suddenly learned to dimension door
probably 
christina made a real witch witch
shes powerful enough to escape you
&quot;witch&quot; but really wizard
she can hang around daggercourt as the estate mage
i was thinking if you guys befriend christinas girl
but he probably heard about the dinosaurs
idk why lautrec is there
for elsa
milo wants to just be there
jett wants his staff-axe
you walked your ass up there already
a half-baked revenge plot
they barter
no but if you bring it back
well yea. rare leathers and giant-craft is always prized
as exotic goods tend to be
theres more valuable stuff in the northlands tho
saving the world doesnt turn much of a profit does it
you can yeet their grain or smth
no theyre dead broke
i was gonna type smth for them later
theyre hidden
so wtf
but like i remade them anyway
i copied them over
im like 99% sure i told you
so you dont have to worry about knowing their shit
are totally different now

Yo how is it. I'm almost home
Just like violence is an option
I might skip Parsas.  It's all rp and I like combat once or twice
yea understandable
I'm out for most of out but I'll try to make it
Oh that's pretty cool
im just sad theres no good time to run gestalt for like 2 weeks
i think he wrote that
what did you think of it
you were there right
same
jett and i agreed it was kinda dull
yea
true
with all the villagers and shit
i feel like i ended it on a really hopeless note
i might spend the time making omega a more interesting fight
dont
if people don't feel it then they don
its his game
nah its fine
it was a whole thing
and shit
and he like called us
i wanted an inuit named nikliq
milo wanted that one
yea
hes not excited over having to not be &quot;agile like monkey&quot;
also i think i went like an hour over where i planned last night
like i dont think gestalt was perfect but still
idk if he wants to run it consistently then fuck it
i figured
hmm
oh damn
is this not
like the ac inc shit
ig. we left him hanging last time he ran smth tho
kms
nope but now
milo and i just wanted to meme with &quot;agile like monkey&quot; and &quot;nikliq seal-clubber&quot;
didnt realize how anal his setting was
idk i was bord
fuck
i told parsa id join his game cause christinas busy
yo
yo
yo
for now its around a week into the future
i think as time goes on and the party grows powerful his visions will extend
of the first call
yea that was the biggest mistake
should be details
establishment, house spies, etc
like anything in his future he can see but not in the general future
i personally think it should be just base stuff tho
waking up is hard
gdi
this isnt group chat
oh wait
Morozov: Where are you from, traveler. The townsfolk say you come from the west and that you speak of events most unnatural.

Jacob: I'm from Hillshadow, my lord. Its a small town a few days eastward of Rockywind. Well, it was a small town now. The place is taken over by some foul being. It came from the mountains it did. Walked down from above like some herald of the saints. And thats what it told us it was too. Those who listened to it gathered in the old chapel. I was on watch duty that day you see, but I could hear it kinda. It talked to us about &quot;The Mistress&quot; and promised she would come save us. Things aren't good for us out there in the valley. Yolen's boy lost two fingers by the river the other day and...

Morozov: Yes, I understand. Please focus on this creature. Did you perchance see it with your own eyes or hear any further about its master?

Jacob: Well it called itself an angel. One of them old ones too, straight out of the Edicts. Didn't give us no name though. Thats what set me off. Wouldn't give us the name of his &quot;mistress&quot; either, said she was beyond us. Whatever that means. The others bought it though.They gathered in that chapel and listened to him preach for hours. It was harmless enough. If only strange to see a faceless angel in full plate give sermon. He talked about saving us, giving us strength to fight the horrors that walk recently. Took two boys out back afterwards to teach them to fight. That's when it got real suspicious. I was on watch the next night too. Arren passed the morning and usually they rise at night. Only he didn't. The two boys didn't either. You ask me the angel took their souls. Can't rise again with no souls. 

Morozov: The vision fades here. I can see no further and Jacob will not make it to the estate for 2 days. We will consult then.

-Excerpt from Morozov's meeting on May 16th, penned by Mikhail Morozov on May 14th. 

This is the full understanding of the situation in the western towns so far
aight ill take a look
etc
tavern, smithy, general store
what kind of establishment anyway
i got it
aight
being a renovation and not a construction
alright. the establishment should take a little over a month and a half
the hagan loan is personal you know
alright
go be the tiebreaker
see
i
yea but its contents are the same
what use do you have for a second
I think so. In like 30 after lunch Iâ€™ll remake group and we talk details
Also if Parsa goes are you down to start 830-9 so Jett can be there all of it
Also if Parsa goes are you down to start 830-9 so Jett can be there all of it
Boomer
Ok
Thereâ€™s no way they donâ€™t have it
Did you ask the clerks. 
Nah promenade closed
Grove?
Which Barnes is still running
Ok boomer
On like iTunes books
That's so weird. I got it digitally cause it was top 50
What scuffed store is this
Wtf it was a huge seller
I think Milo saw it clearer
It is but it was kinda scuffed idk 
Milos probably right tho
It was a long talk
Also he kinda did Idk
Yea
Maybe in a while we can give him a chance as an npc for a session
Still feels bad cutting him out 
Yea but we covered other important stuff
maybe
like the shit we talked about yesterday
if people arent changing then thinking up plots is useless
this feels kind of pointless tho cause idk if were even doing this
glorfindel's departure has upset the balance of nature. his internal darkness has spread to all fey-touched beings across thaeron as he is the reigning Lord of the Fey of that area. the decline of arcane magic has left the city's people vulnerable to the elves' wrath and so your mentors have asked for your assistance in tracking him own
yea that works. either like a feywild journey or some crypt
or you are there and are tryng to get to your mentors in dc
something could be wrong there
things that do tie into the city are like the 2 local baronys
Unless Hydrius is the final boss
I'll figure that later
See I've kind of given up on tying it to gestalt
Idea 2 is the weather is abnormal and crops fail. Elves become cruel and vicious and the forests now devour outsiders. Something is wrong in the court of the fey and they've demanded you be the ones to seek audience 
Idk. That's just idea 1
or even killing the dragon's host before he fully emerges as a grown dragon
then goals can be getting people to safety up north
its up to the party and heroes across auren to save towns and hold back the horde
its chooses its champion and gathers its children to march on Auren, demolishing the gate with his new form
anyway, as the fort falls, the red spirit has reforged itself and waited for this moment
while chromatics force themselves into the dragonborn most suited to them
e.g. metallics choose a dragonborn to be the heir based on virtue and when a copper or whatever dies, it inhabits the chosen heir
each dragon color is a single soul connected to the dead draconic gods and red, the vilest of all, hasnt been seen since the greatest red dragon of all was slain
yet now, the oculus has shattered and magic is failing
but for hundreds of years the fort guarded the pass and the divided tribes could never unite to truly threaten them
kobolds, wyvern, dragonborn, etc
the story is that Auren, south of Thaeron has always been at risk from the dragon-related creatures to the south
wdyt of this one
whatever
theres no real interaction in that tho
understandable
ik. its annoying as fuck
dude doesnt communicate
idk what miles wants
i was gonna pitch the full new start or smth if i really like it
i havent committed to any ideas
cool
thats smth i have to think about
cause by the time everyones at dc itll be scaled normal
and then i dont need to waste hours scaling down npcs
like some backwater adventurers who heard about big things going down
that kind of interests me
what about starting in a different part of the world and heading to daggercourt/the morozovs later
Yea I forget the details
Ik I brought that one up at some point but not to whom
I think that was it. Idk I had a lot of ideas on back burner but can't remember them really
That's not really a reset of gestalt
Oh I wanted to do a league campaign right
but really idk. just trust me that most people really love book 1
also theres more magic which im usually into
the next 2 bring in more pov characters and i just stopped caring as much
the first book can be the full journey of a man's life
meh
like heres the thing. i liked blood song so much more than stormlight cause the emotional journey is there in just 1 book but the sequels
i didnt bring it up cause that but i was thinking and ik youd like the book
just humans and swords
i wanted to run a campaign in that kind of setting but theres no magic
its so good
if you havent i think you should cause its deadass top 4 books ive ever read and short
its where i got brother caenis from
by anthony ryan
have you ever read blood song
So basically nothing
Cause all I have for something new is maybe related to the local barons 
I wish Milo was more down with randoms tbh. Ideally he'd be open to getting like 3 or 2 and jett and running gestalt start to end or smth
Yea ik. Waiting just sucks
Yea. If only they'd get made faster
Yea. If only they'd get made faster
Same I want all the colors for dispel
im gonna sleep to see if i can wake up for my 8am
wwe can talk more in the morning
especially when miles isnt ever invested
doesnt really work
but 4 players with 1 who cant show up halfway
honestly yea. milo jett and i talked about kicking him
theres hope
if literally 1 major thing is fixed. like i can run a story and people invest in it and play charactesr
it helps
thanks ig
and if they know im working on smth they wont bother to change
the thing is if i stick in chat ill just tilt more
momma addams thicc af
also the animation was cute
nah i deadass like kids movies cause its simple and fun and i can just space
my creativity has pretty much been going to campaign
i just watch shit like addams family and im gonna watch frozen
im not big on movies but maybe
she saw it already
maybe finally get to portal/stardew
lol. we have the a list thing for amc so were probably gonna watch movies
but like its clear they wanted me out for a while so i left chat
get back into league or whatever even if milo wont play
i can figure out shit to do in my free time that isnt writing
i have job stuff and a gf to spend time with
they want me out for a month then thats ok
so like ok then fuck it
and suddenly people are like fuck you go take a month
and i liked running it and looked forward to it right
see thats the dumbest part tho. i was into this one and like pushing content for sessions available basically every week
but nobody cared
makes no sense
story wise
they want to run ruin delving then fuck it just combat and dungeon crawling when i feel ready to try again
i havent thought anything about the new campaign or what to even do
im a doomer rn
hes still drowning out everyone elses opinion
i dont need to for the 10th time
ive just heard your ideas and votes so much
bitch stfu you are 
also wtf is parsa saying &quot;am i even a character&quot;
and see who comes up with the next game resetting one
so the next part of the cycle is writing a story to fix one problem
never fixed
anyway i feel like all the problems i have are known
baby rage
lacroix the ex officer who was publicly disgraced cant walk into the dwarven house and command audience
he overextended and got slapped
not really level 6 shit but ok i tried
iago wants to murder and bring down the church
literally his only goal is to talk to people and record events
and log it
wtf am i doing with a bard only there to record the city burning
his dumbass background wasnt aligned at all
bc ive given up on this long story arc thing
which is why im still open to seeing if i can write smth short that i still like
small things but its smth
metagaming
like the things that can be fixed are diametrically opposed alignments/interests
jetts kinda afk
i flame parsa constantly
miles knows he doesnt talk much
milo knows he cedes his characters interests for the groups
weve told them these things before
and in like 2 weeks we start the cycle again
otherwise i go write some story i want to run with this newish setting
lol
and then hell freezes over
make people idk engaged at least somewhat
agree to things like alignment and goals so i dont juggle that
come to a consensus
at this point my plan is take a break and see if you guys talk some shit out
same. i also cant bring this up to them cause theyve heard it already
thats a thing too
so
and youre the only one reading
only to ruin it by ceding to the others interest
who is the only one doing serious introspection
nobody thinks about character moments except weirdly milo
i care that rn every session is you and parsa dominating and milo miles just saying aight
i dont really care about that session tho
idfk
and the greenhosue of poisonous plants
or maybe you can just use chemical warfare
still 700 who will die in dragon breath or smth
like shit man he got 700 thats pog
which hes been stocking on
like he gathered up 70% of all his hired men
many times the size of any medieval city was
its a fictional city
also who complains about 700
with all the dragon and giant plots
i thought it would be interesting
his pet mage creating illusions and distortions to throw you off
devin fox lurking trying to pick stragglers 
hunt in the woods as he tries to make decoy wagons
you were just about to leave the city
so im just there like wtf
reee
level scaling sucks
then i get blindsided with we spend too much time in the city
closing in for the kill
chase him through the woods
and like i wanted to do something cool with the riegans
theres no point tho if they just dont like it and do nothing
i dont want to run for randoms again
yea so majority rules
since nobody wants to interact with the old one
but idk where to take the new story
i saved the link for the other chat in case i feel different in a day or two
idk
combats go faster
minor shit like dont metagame
equal contribution and character moments i dont jsut hand out
or no railing
and not be accused of railroading
the major things is i want to run a story and not have people swap constantly
but like those are minor things right
or saying shit from a continent away
like why the fuck are people debating tactics in combat
i mean fair. metagaming is pretty big in all the campaigns so far
idk
maybe thats why people get bored of it
id like equal contribution yea
seeing as i gave up on it before him
he was the last one sticking to black empire
its not always him tho
then idk it just deteriorated as i thought about how everything else goes down
like i peaked in excitement around 2 when everyone was rolling and shit
its been a long day
yea surprisingly
and we talked more but with like jett in there
terraria and league
kinda did the same thing this morning
he sprung his campain shit on us during terraria
like 6 with parsa
we played like 9 hours terraria + league
yea we were playing terraria and he joined in to talk about it
otherwise its normal complaints i guess
today
then discussion all morning
no we had like a 6 hour call with milo saturday
or i dont have a hook why are we always in the city why is mars setting hooks
the archbishop can dominate me at will when i fuck with her
get complained about theres no safety net
yea ik. so i make no rails
so the clear conclusion is the long campaigns dont work. smth im doing isnt working. i tried more character driven stuff this time cause that was the last problem
3 is a pattern
3 people left black empire
honestly i cant even say its the players
i didnt realize levels mattered more than the story and the position in the arc
clearly not
i figured now everyones a better player so it should be doable
and i wished it had lasted longer with more build up but that was unrealistic
they rose from literal nobodies to facing the mother of demons
i liked the first campaign because even if i had to push it a little everyone decided to take a stand against lilith
but i like the long stories where you start as nothing and build into the realization that you can rewrite the fate given
i can do small campaigns where it ends at level 4, you become lords of your small town and live happily ever after
and even then half of them complained the sword was scripted railroading
the first one had to be accellerated or it would never have concluded
theres no way theyll let me run a full story right
made me realize
but like pointing out how every other campaign falls apart
i didnt think i was this tilted
kobolds in mines are cool
everyone decided politics and story were lame
but like no
the one who brought you so far but betrayed you
literally a battle for the world against the champion of pure evil
faster and stronger than any mortal, more alert and able to cloak her rune uses while seeking yours
pulling and pushing people off balance or sending objects away
pulling herself to and from
how do you play around someone who can manipulate metals at will
it was going to be sick. facing all 8 runes at once wouldve been the greatest battle
the aura around her a wash of nothingness, no emotion to drive you, only the logic in your mind to tell you what you should feel
gifted with all 9 metallic runes
the climax would be taking on the assassin
but never could because he was removed
the same realization his father was coming into
or uses his will to seek his own destiny
and then he has to decide if he chooses the fate handed to him
where morozov thought he was the serpents ace, he was only ever a pawn
beloved of the hresvelgs and the key to their usurping the city and therefore the most key holy land of the serpents greatest foe
brought low by her subtle touch, the touch of one who has seen what is to come
the assassin reveals herself, yumiko, daughter of a ruined land
and as he goes to use the serpents gift it fizzles
waiting for that moment to turn the city against him
has nobodys trust because the hresvelgs knew his secret and his dads but never revealed it
he thinks that this too will be solved by the serpents gift only to realize that the assassin has been with the hresvelgs all along. hes been played into looking like the one thriving on chaos and therefore causing it
morozov is riding high on his borrowed power, drawn from the very embodiment of chaos and evil. the one creature who can give him the ability to foresee and win unwinnable fights
the one who can break the balance
with the assassin as the golden snitch
the hresvelgs
then the final confrontation comes between your newly dominant house and the final power left in the city in your way
and get justice
you take advantage of it to bring down your house enemies
i thought it was a good story. assassin reappears and pushes the city closer to ruin
but it just gets ignored
like i just want to run my story and have people pay attention to it without them feeling railroaded
wtf am i gonna do with adrian i killed my homeland lacroix
pennys and morozovs were being taken on too
we were ON lautrecs arc
but like the dumbest shit is half the people just want to run their character arc which is fine but cant wait until someone elses is done
and also not railroad
i cannot physically both point out every plot relevant thing
ignored him
after saving loren's house from ruin
they just want specific tasks on free time
apparently i only give you hooks but nobody else aks
but if i do its railroading
because i didnt explicitly point them out?
but the moral dillemas and character moments were ignored
thats the point 
like fine everyone hates them
nobody paused to think maybe were the bads after eliot consistently tries to improve the city
but nobody read it or cared
and their house being vampires or some dark shit
like the journal literally accusing erasmus of being the killer
like theres supposed to be things characters want to investigate
not even finished with the riegans, the lowest of the conspirators, and people dont care
and character establishing
when thats supposed to be tone setting
milo complaining the guards didnt kill iago
lautrec
like you know what caused it
stun vs 40 hold persons
no matter what in that scenario she yoinks his files
and complain that we lose
lets go try to antagonize the archbisho
nobody cares
the assassin using multiple metallics
because she didnt read it
and the whole plot of metallics and saints
lucia ignores her rune
when they literally perform totally different things
or rune imbalance
ok then i get complained about for focusing on base building
people ignore the whole assassination thing and chase other goals and literally complain im keeping them in the city
people complain about being in the city
i do lautrecs side thing
like lucias claim is refuted and she brings down the heretic
but they want side plots the whole time
bring her down and restore the dukedom
find the assassin
like gestalt was supposed to be working into nobility to take out the conspiracy
parsa wants character driven arcs but i cant work all 5 of them into the story
but some people hate it and some like it
like the thing is i want to run a story and shit usually
or take a stance
milo was aight but hes not able to drown out everyone
i cant blame jett for having work
im pretty sure miles and parsa alt tabbed the whole time
and played it
you were like the 1 person who actually got into the last campaign
cuck
did you call
that too
but yea
and end hresvelg monopoly on shipping
or like improve lives for workers
seeing as he turned a new leaf
all the pcs and npcs of morozov are no longer as evil
actually hes probably mellowed out
idk how your character will deal with vyrmias tho
i mean yea thats basically it
so like its chill
they didnt really want to and switched
they proposed it and it was interesting
but idc
seeing as it is the privilege of nobles
i told them they could go no magic for lore
ig
and thats the new mode
it seems milo jett parsa are going no magic
and easier making low level hooks
its hard making high level mages. its easier giving them like 3 spells
idk. kind of
or ror
league?
and also that you manage to find a way Beyond and acquire an axe
tbh i just wanted to share it because its never going to come up in campaign bc its just politics and money
the other kicker is though that if your soul is exceptionally terrible and nilgesh chooses it to serve him youre spared
they return eventually
its also why elves are somewhat lucky
it keeps everything from falling apart
exactly. thats why the church spreads the information it does
but theyre obviously wrong about nilgesh's defeat
also the church is half right. all gods except the saints are just echoes now, no longer able to directly intervene as they once could
nobody heard from either since the assassination
shes either laying low or glorfindel got her
all gods, all souls are his in the end, in exchange for a brief relief in the mortal plane
nilgesh left the mortal plane in return for all the Beyond to be his feeding grounds
and thus they were forced into making a bargain
sending the effect backwards in time to make it so they never won in the first place
the ninth saint found them in the future when they thought they had won and bound them in chains
nilgesh killed him and rather than face an eternity of torture he sold them out
the ninth saint betrayed them
man the guy from the future IS nilgesh
also did you figure out lucia's vision
his main ones are just going to be the spear and the rune
yea i figured its making up for his no items
like fireball
but youre only human so you cant avoid everything
the big weakness is things that can't be dodged. you still see them coming and react the best you can so you make the save
by focusing on an attack you see where its going before they even start so youre long gone by the time it arrives
it works for all attack rolls. youre spending a whole reaction on this instead of something else. like passively youre letting nilgesh move your body out of harms way which is why your ac is so high
which is pretty much how its meant to be
the rune is really broken on a high speed fighter
and it always misses
you take the reaction AS they make the action so if they make a melee attack you just dash out
btw the uncanny dodge is the worse reaction
etc
cruelty bonus to crits
despair stuns
so like you always proc the violent additional action
actually i should just make it so while you have the serpent mark channeled you always roll successful on your secondary
tbh i just made it customizable enough
tapping into a power literally even gods cant touch to turn the tide in hopeless situations at the cost of always being a pariah
its like the ultimate last resort
as you see the future and predict their defenses
like you dodge through a horde of foes and cut them down before they can react
i actually wanted it to be a more melee focused rune
you just arent limited to spell + cantrip
no its a bonus action spell
for a half minute he becomes a god of death
but also if he chugs 5000gp to get to max charges
i mean its not going to be gamebreaking which is the point
i figure its a super op effect but at the cost of 1000gp for a round
Metallic Rune of the Forgotten Saint - Must use a liquefied platinum elixir which takes 6 hours to prepare at an Alchemist's table and 1000gp of materials to create an elixir restoring 10 charges, the elixir fails if you fail a DC 16 Alchemy check. Unlike other Metallic Runes, the Metallic Rune of the Forgotten Saint always manifests in male heirs, usually lethally.

The Mark of the Forgotten Saint is better known as the Serpent's Mark. The existence of the Ninth Saint is a secret known only to the highest in the Church and those who have sought forbidden knowledge. Depending on who tells the story, the Ninth Saint either slew Nilgesh or betrayed the others before falling. Either way, he was cursed to bear the Serpent's Mark for his actions, a curse passed through his bloodline. 

Alone of all deities, Nilgesh exists beyond the confines of time. His sight sees all that was, is, and will be at all times. Even in death, the Serpent's power cannot be denied. His rune gives the wielder an infinitesimal fraction of his power, but still enough to pierce the boundaries of time. While the rune requires much greater power than any other to use, it grants a sight forbidden even to gods. 

10 charges - for the next round, you see and react to every movement before it happens, though you are limited by the physical limits of your form. During this time, you make all attacks and checks(e.g. athletics) with +10 and advantage, critically striking on any roll above 30 and ignoring critical misses. All targeted effects have disadvantage and -10 to hit against you and cannot critically strike. You automatically succeed physical saves (con, dex, str) and have double advantage on mental ones (cha, int, wis) as you brace before spells take hold. You can take a reaction to Uncanny Dodge or Dash 15 feet up to 2 times(+1 for every additional 15 ft of movement). Your reaction is taken as the enemy declares their action. Additionally, while the Serpent's power flows through you, when you take an action to cast a spell treat it as though it were cast 2 levels higher. If you do so, you can cast another spell as a bonus action. These effects are cancelled out if there is another person channeling the Rune of the Forgotten Saint within 300ft.

Innate: The Serpent bestows great power upon his servitors. You can choose one aspect of his nature to manifest as a secondary Rune for you, a boon even the Saints cannot offer. Choose from:

Corruption

Cruelty

Despair

Omnipresent

Undying

Violence
so his sons all inherited the Serpent's Mark
actually it was the RQ who saved him from Nilgesh but not before his inherent rune was awakened
he encountered the Serpent's Heart when digging, the same day he found the deposit of Shadowfell Lead
and thats why everyone turned on him and brought him to ruin
anyway from the snippets of vladimir's journal its pretty clear he was having visions of the future
i feel that
well yea
Yea but is tied to the lore and you're the only one who read and understood the visions 
Yea but is tied to the lore and you're the only one who read and understood the visions 
and you tell me if its too weak/strong
so can i run jetts rune through you
then this mark alone
no, one circle formed of 8
one is lucia's rune, the mark of Gemi, one is the mark above
except the last page which has nine symbols like the one above
the interior of the book is blank page after page
though none truly know the meaning of the metallic runes
penny recognizes it as similar to the brand of lucia's rune
the cover of the book is branded with this mark
anyway, this time the petty manages get in contact with syvana's lieutenant who sends back book bound with human skin. Chip tells you he was told the book would let you commune with her
are the prisoners still the plan
if you wanted to set up a shell noble house it could be done over a few weeks. otherwise these same officials arent particularly concerned with who stamps the seal, only that you show up with one
anyway what i was gonna say is nathaniel obviously won't forge documents himself but he has connection in the government who would overlook forged forms and sign off dubious inspections
Yea. I'll let you know tomorrow. I'm gonna sleep
But it's an ambitious project. Usual fakes are as guildsmen or dock workers and merchants
Which hagan can make happen for a price
Ultimately there will be a lot of forgery to do
Well there's proof of property ownership to handle. As well as proof of wealth and birth
That'll take some time. There's lots of forms and proof needed to get noble house approval. A lot of inspectors to bribe and a lot of testimony to fake
What kind of ID. A seal of nobility. Letters of a Freeman. Right to work card. Guild membership card. Etc
obviously
in character you know not everyone
everyone with a greater rune has a vision related to it
eternal torture should only be for the worst, most irredeemable
there should be judgement and punishment/reward dished out to the deserving
because death is supposed to be fair
yea the vision could give you the idea that the saint's victory wasnt as complete as they thought
in character you only know your vision
for only nilgesh remains with that power
so those who can truly see the future cannot be trusted
because he completely shattered the divine and ruined their plan
but nilgesh created a corrupt version that can see what is to come in his future
the original eye saw all that was to come in the divine plan
the wizard
stealing its ability to see into the future
nilgesh blinded and corrupted it
parsas vision was the all seeing eye being shattered
he was forced to leave reality and they are sheltering some souls from him
its hard to say if theyre wrong tho
using their sacred weapons and the words of power
also her religion teaches that the eight saints were able to kill him
thats the thing about crazy people. they never really understand whats possible
he could only see fina and the Last Emperor but the other gods were the swaying bodies
the white tree is the one from the moonlight palace where he first entered reality
Lautrec's was Nilgesh torturing the defeated and dying gods
but yours was the souls of the saints protecting a few souls from Nilgesh in the afterlife
obv not in character
just for story reasons
im gonna post everyones and explain them all in the chat once theyre done
you understood what yours and lautrecs visions were yea
understandable
the only ones with agency there are the nine and the entity
seems..unlikely
also as a thing to consider. penny has now seen death and knows that its nothing but eternal torment. whatever the nine souls at the center were, they cant protect everyone. and whatever afterlife the gods promise, they must have lied
it paints a target on you but also tells people youre a hard target to bring down
no, all of them
yea it does
but if you fall again you start with 1 fail as usual
any death save over 20 brings you up
also when you drop below 0 you automatically make a death save and add your con mod
yea its lifesteal
and when you hit multiple people the healing is 1/6th
when you deal single target damage you restore 1/3rd the health
no its damage you deal
its gotta be hard to hide and extremely sought after
well i had to. the rune is too good otherwise
yes
Greater Rune of the Undying - You heal for 1/3rd of damage dealt from single target attacks and spells, reduced by half for any attack or spell that hits multiple targets. Innate: You add your con mod to death saves. Any death save over 20 returns you to 1hp and you make one immediately upon reaching 0hp. You still gain stacking death saves upon reaching 0hp.
it comes with a vision of a gaping maw, the souls of the damned swirling within. Within lurks something malicious and cruel, it tears at the souls and weakens them. Some have been there for eons and are stretched so thin and weak they appear as silken strands. Others, new, flood in. Fresh and full, the entity pulls them in, relishing in the torment. Nine golden souls lie in the center of the vortex of the damned, sheltering but a few from the nightmare, though one is tainted through its core with a chaotic grey pattern. The entity stares at you and you realize this is the fate that awaits all souls. The gods have abandoned mortals. There is no judgement, no redemption or heaven. As the entity begins to pull you in, two glowing words you know to be &quot;Eternal&quot; and &quot;Defy&quot; appear as a glowing turquoise rune. A burning hand presses into your lower back and heaves you back into reality
aight. also pennys rune
you arent entirely sure what her end goal is rn
a lot of straight up psychopaths dont get that and try to join thinking its a free pass to murder and terrorize
the guild has to maintain a low profile and civility
the most common reason people leave the guild is theyre deemed too violent
or never making it past your petty and quitting
or quitting
no you can be rejected by not even making it into initiation
well, some info relevant to your paygrade is she's started a rival criminal syndicate using the enslaved people and her abominations. she mostly deals with trafficking and murder for now but theres non-slaved criminals, mostly guild rejects, that are starting to join up
Each one takes a toll on the mind. Knowing as many as she does is dangerous
And knows more words of power than any creature should
She's paranoid and manic
Written from before Nilgesh prevented all other creatures from seeing the future besides him
Not yet. They got close but Omega stopped them and she escaped. They found rumors though she's after the archbishop's book of Ancient Words. It's supposedly a tome written by Vixendel containing all known runes and their transcription to words of power
I'll post yours in a sec I'm walking home
I'll post yours in a sec I'm walking home
Yours isn't metallic
The con save was to save her from more. Metallic is deadly 
Lucia lived 7d10
Don't you have like 60 hp
Ok. The damage is 5d10 +4d6
int
youre not totally lost
well now that you've been in the academy and watched hanneman
but yea just think about it for next month's money
fair enough. though i dont endorse it, theres also the rune station in the officers den. backalley tatoos are the best kappa
unless youre ok with the power dynamic
ik. im saying you should consider getting penny's innate one done
it seems like everyone's doing their runes now so i dont want penny left behind
Otherwise it can be half awakened for just the innate bonus or smth
Btw penny will be significantly weaker than the others without her rune. If you get it done she can still pretend it's not there to maintain pride and moral stance
this is a lot of money
i want money
but im so fucking stressed rn
literally if i do well i could be making 115k+ in just salary and they both give huge stock and signing bonuses
this is the big week. Wish round 2 technical and Amazon round 2
havent had time to think in a sec
yea idk. i have interviews and shit so im cramming those
good intentions but with an evil method 
its still chaos and disorder
especially the significant power it has given one of its chosen
it disapproves of murder because its an abuse of power
tbh i wrote that. it likes punishing those who abuse power and causing chaos and change for the better
wouldve been easy to kill him on the streets and throw th body into the river
he wants to avoid paperwork and shit
idk that wouldve been less in character right
i also forgot hunters mark and colossus slayer the whole time
but it was so one sided it felt dumb
ik
theyre still elves even if theyre ordered not to kill
maybe the guards wouldve killed him
that isnt outright suicidal
he wants to atone for his murders but idk what his god would have him do
yo idk what to do with iago
Lmao I found Milo
There's a crossing there 
Station at the science museum
Ride it to the usc side of the station
I'm at the natural history Museum but on the usc side 
Or nah
On the usc side
The museum's
Where are you
I'm almost at the second one. Did I walk past you
Aight. I'll keep going
Aight. I'll keep going
Usc one
Im like at the station
Aight
Lmao
Wait I'm on the campos side
Ok I'll bump into you on exposition 
Are you like near the campus
I'm walking Christina onto campus
Where are you rn
Wya
aight christina is out of her lab at 9 but you can pop over at 6 and we'll hang until then
make milo come over
wanna do it here
the usc one or sm
you doing anything tmrw night
plus some random personal items like loaded dice and the hand mirror
btw the total stuff lifted came out to 136 gold, mostly from the noblewoman
of course
thats your call lol
yumiko put on a public performance and chad made a round of the city restocking taverns for free
gathering goodwill
eliot was giving out food and shelter that day
who knows. maybe theyre just trying to help out though
but penny doesnt know which it is
although there is the possibilty they were destroyed in earlier riots
after all its the day right after the big fires and unless he went out in the night to look at which houses burned and who was in them AND pick up all the gifts, he must have known earlier
well penny is jaded so she thinks theres also a possibility the man already knew which houses would burn
crossed out for each house. he was about halfway done it looks like
with a small description of each person and what they lost
on the list
theres like names-property address-gift
no he has his list so hes just following it
he skips a few
also he doesnt go to every burned house
theyre not high value but they are sentimental
or a dress for some woman
like set of rolling pins for a baker who lost his shop
its one of those messenger bags full of little personalized gifts
hes quite a decent talker
you trailed him as he went directly door to door and gave them small gifts and gold then made his offer
yea the guy you stole from is a hresvelg employee trying to buy burned buildings
what no. this guy was going to all the burned buildings and offering to buy them
seeing as it didnt burn
and that one tavern with a bid under its price
but with their current bid on the property
yea its like the list of available buildings for sale
27 stealth 28 sleight of hand. you spend the week thieving and score two big marks. one hresvelg inspector going through and marking buildings and one noblewoman of a house you dont know. you pick the inspectors list of ruined buildings and offers given, including 1 tavern you know survived the riot. and you get the woman's purse and find a good bit of gold and Pure Silver hand mirror
nah hes just an npc now
or swipe the list
either search all the cells for his people
theres 2 choices for him yea
is something lautrec might be interested in
which you know
sure but it tracks ALL people scheduled to be going in. you could see if theres someone likely to cause a distraction or prisoner shipments. and also people who WERE brought in in the last 2 months
or see who else is there
so if youre on it you can walk right in
no its like a synced guest list
and theyre all synced, like spanreeds
it tracks authorized visitors and whos currently on the island
kept at all teleportation circles and the ferry dock
they do learn though that theres a visitor ledger
the barracks and shit are on the ground level near the northeast corner
they know his where his evidence room and squad barracks roughly are. his apartment is likely near the top of a spire due to his rank but not sure
yo what did you have the petty doing week 2
with a government sigil or pass
theres hundreds of passengers each trip so you might be able to blend in
a real wonder
enchanted to never sink and never stray from the path
full steel, roughly 118ft in length
yea theres a ship that goes to and from every other hour
it probably wont make it back and definitely cant carry cargo
you can pick up a rowboat that will survive the journey for 100gp
3k+
afterwards you can ask parsa how he would have reacted
the drugs have definitely wore off
well its a cage moreso than the cart
idk what their capabilities are fully
you should form the plan with the others probably
without modern fabrics and mechanical engineering to let you guide it down
but its not ideal above a boiling river
parachute isnt exactly rocket science
it arcs up
no the bridge is far above it
at night
the bridge has a rotating patrol
youve staked out that area before or the petty has
to one of its circles
if you don't have a teleportation key
you either jump 200 feet from the silver bridge or sail in
like its located on the river
this is one of the hardest places to break into within the city
aight. anyway you should flesh out more of a plan i think
cultists in masks sounds like some joker shit tho
not yet
nah
is this the joker 
flat red mask gang
you can paint it yourself if you want to
good call
if you want it quick too
for 20 gold youd get some meh masks
depends if its a carved mask or just painted
or pick up some blanks
but yea you can commission carnival masks if you want
its not like the citadel is without wards and mages
depends how they fight the guard right
as far as carnival masks go theyre kind of a specialty item but theres a lady who can make them
usually of higher quality than your standard city guard
the citadel has normal guards
yea they don't guard him but theyre housed in the citadel usually close by
and take the goods
where theyre trained to barge in and arrest or kill everyone
his strike team is kind of like swat
cloaks and cloth is easy and cheap. like under 10 gold cheap
what materials
theres no official guild policy tho
or bonuses
obv morale goes up with pay raises though
though you can set a rate you think is fair
i think when you have them dedicate a week to your tasks you should pay them
only you can see it
with info gathered by the petty
theres a character sheet under misc nobles for william grey
e
fuck thats lam
idk
are there
just takes so long to come out
yea id hope so
yea. maybe one day
fuck thats so long
whens this out
lit
christina is out and im done with work for a little
do you wanna hang out or smth
i guess
i dont really want to split the party but
which boys
no but theres other people from the guild who have seen or will see the ad and compete for it. as long as youre first the time doesnt matter. man just has to die and the shipment gets returned
she has this one in a jar of blood for preservation
probably but they couldve survived. its just a ~4 inch patch of flesh removed
pretty much
but nobody knew their parents well enough to know theirs
yea
gives exhaustion when you run out
its like a mini action surge. gives you an extra bonus action and reaction on a round. con mod times per short rest
if you contact them out of the blue after a break from them
and may sometimes be out on their own work
you can treat them like house staff you dont pay but they get a cut of job money
also your new petty is back from their mission. theyre listed under thieves guild characters
fuck it
yea i rolled for perception and got a 20 so
so tracking &quot;norman grey&quot; is not easy but you manage to do it. a few silver in bribes to local squatters leads the way to an abandoned house just north of marker 6. While meeting them, you notice their guise is an illusion and they dismiss it and introduce themselves as Syvana Folen, second youngest of their huge house. She works with a guild of slavers from Auren moving captured tabaxi drugged and passed for wild cats. A Duke's Eye of moderate rank caught on and intercepted the shipment. His name is William Grey, 64 years old, was a high ranked Eye known for rigid adherence to the laws but got demoted by the son. She wants his death to look deliberate but not trackable. He lives at the Citadel and thats where she thinks hes keeping the shipment. The payment offered is the abandoned house which is in good condition, 3 stories tall with a basement that leads to the Guild network. The top floor contains an altar to Valyra consisting of a marble statue trimmed in gold in a fountain. Also 5000gp or a Lesser Rune of the Quickblade
slaver on a task from his guildmaster. willing to pay a level 10 payment to anyone who completes the job. they were moving in slaves and a government official is holding it hostage so he wants the guy killed. wants you to let him know who sent you and that its ok to let party members know about the job
you got the message though right
fuck its late
its just birthday
wait no i was right the first time
nah the implication in birthday is party
so, birthday party
ill start it when you get here
nah theyve been talking to orcs
aight
are you almost here
wya
yea for sure
so i aint got shit
christinas gone studying for a midterm until wednesday night
lmk if you wanna do smth tomorrow
fuck that kid
thats fine
do you know the guy
your roommate can hear the sociopathic shit said during campaign
i see. still hype tho
tomorrow?
when are you fully moving in
good shit
Don't get shot walking over
Don't get shot walking over
How far are you actually 
What. Did you get in a car the wrong way
What. Did you get in a car the wrong way
Literally directly across the street from it 
There's only one by usc

Drive or uber or what
Drive or uber or what
Also how did you get there
Is it just you there
so np

and i think hes going to berkeley soon or smth
yea cause that place is free
well yea they work and go to school in sm
why are you moving
thats lit
and less from her place
shits only a 20-30 minute walk tho
directly opposite side of usc from me tho
thats kinda close to christinas place
oh wtf. whats the address
sick. when at
its by the chipotle and chickfila
southeast corner of usc
i think?. tuscany apartments. ik its on figueroa
i figure this is her telling the group
xd
as a blackcap
they only tell you how high the conspiracy goes once youre committed
nobody does that
nathaniel, her handler, being a ringleader
i figure redpenny is an enforcer and a blackcap
The city of Daggercourt, being built along the banks of a boiling river, has never struggled with heating. The sewer tunnels double to bring some of the Divide's boiling water underneath the houses and shops in the city to provide warmth. The fact that there are tunnels under the city not filled with unimaginably foul substance has proven a huge boon to the Thieves Guild. When the city was being built over the ruins of Te-rong following the Calamity, a section of the previously existing tunnels was &quot;forgotten&quot; by a particularly incompetent official. This quickly became home to a nest of shady characters who caused the same official to section off the area above their den as the Bazaar and write codes banning permanent buildings.

    Now, the lack of permanent buildings needing heating has disguised the Thieves Guild usage of the forgotten tunnels. A few of the shops rimming the Bazaar are marked with shadowmarks that distinguish them as entrances to the Nest. Unlike their predecessors, the guild members of modernity hollowed out much of the ground, merging the tunnels into an entire underground village complete with questionable stores. Roughly 200 permanent guild members live in the Nest at a given time, mostly fences and spies trading information. The total number of guild members is unknown but most place it around a thousand.

    Organization of the guild follows the same structure set down by the original discoverers of the Nest. Recruits receive a letter from the guild after a full member recommends them, usually through having them perform a simple snatch-and-swap job without being caught. Following the clues to find the Nest is the second test. Upon making their way in, they are paired off with another recruit who becomes their training partner. Roughly a year or so of training and tests later, and recruits learn their final objective: the murder of their partner. He who kills the other is granted full membership as an Initiate and access to certain guild fences, informants, artisans, etc. 

    Initiates are grouped into petties of 8 (a petty being the term for a group of thieves). This petty consists of 2 enforcers, 2 sweet-talkers, an infiltrator, a swifthand, a silencer, and a mastermind. After a year, this petty is reviewed and one member is promoted to Blackcap while the others are reassigned into a new petty. As a Blackcap, a guild member gains the right to post jobs to the guild board and take their own from the board. As a Blackcap, a guild member still performs the role they did in their petty but can form their own petties of any size. Promotion from Blackcap comes from stellar service noticed by a ringleader.

    Up the ladder from the Blackcaps are the Operatives, required to bring in 300gp a month but also granted access to the Officer's Den which is rumored to contain a garden of rare herbs, a stolen Swellbinder rune station, the left index finger of Gemi, and a host of other treasures. Most never rise above Operative but the best of the best are noticed by the Whispering One and promoted to ringleader. Ringleaders manage Operatives and deal with high value clients, as well as taking on the most vital jobs. 

--Something Redpenny said once
also house gloom xd
its a recessive rune with a 1/16 chance to replace the one from your father's line
nah i meant to rewrite that
cause im busy this week
but metallic runes and the church of seiros is the bulk of what i have
then maybe the other churches or smth
im planning on doing the thieves guild handout next
yea no the world wouldve been fuckin doomed
let me write about the adventures of anyone else but our old party
and i was like shit
it literally stemmed from me needing a reason for why metallic runes are so rare
tbh
its like the exact opposite
lmao yea
yew-lyreth and vix-anjing
only 2 of them are double ups
obv without 8 people but
before you summoned lilith all early and shit
its basically where i wanted our last campaign to go
ik
of this campaign
its my favorite meme
hahaha like it
xd yea that was fun for me
because story is lame
and not story
tbh i just wanted to chill and worldbuild
as far as i remmeber
starting the day i mentioned it
Which is kinda the plan. You guys are guinea pigs and then assuredly Milo miles jett leave at the end and we can do the same setting but different start and shit with reddit ppl
Plus again imagine if we do this with randoms and it's all there. It'll be sick
Plus again imagine if we do this with randoms and it's all there. It'll be sick
Yea. At least it's there so I don't feel bad springing shit on them
And it'll be super cool
Mostly so I can reuse this 
Until I have it all
Yea I do more every week 
Go read my lore shit
Damn Mexicans did smth tho
Idk
And some just chilling with light on by the business school
Toward the village from the Tommy Trojan statue
I'm not kidding there's like 5-6 cops gunning it rn
Also it's a GE class
No wonder there's 5 cops with sirens blazing rn
And didn't HMU wtf
What you were here
Probably
Pepega class fr
Still can't bring myself to do it and it's due Wednesday
I spent 4 hours writing shit for campaign instead of an art history paper today
Good enough of a term
Yea
Mostly located around there bazaar because there's few permanent shops so nobody notices there's no heating 
The entrances being safehouses that have trapdoors down
The guild blocked a few off and made their den in them
Because the river water is boiling there's a network of tunnels that go under houses to heat them
The guild uses the thermal tunnels under the city
Ok. The bar is probably by the harbor which is around her street too I assume. You can go to the page and see if there's a particular location
aight. what things
wut
Glaives are good for large amounts of unarmed people
They pretty much are irl
They pretty much are irl
Still just a worse halberd
Still just a worse halberd
So that's up to a d8
So that's up to a d8
Yea but it's masterworked
You can use spear and shield
Spear is versatile
So it's not strictly worse
But a spear can be thrown well
And can be thrown
You'll have to see. Also it's 10ft range
But the spear is more
It's technically masterworked so it's a d8 but still.
Although it's a spear. The worst of weapons
Well in time you'll see what the relic left to the house is made of
Parsa
He's good with harmonic copper
He's good with harmonic copper
Chaotic or smth
Chaotic or smth
He's not lawful good either I think
I'm give you a nice celestial gold weapon 
Really
Aren't you not lawful
Aren't you not lawful
Although I think you should be tracking that yourselves
But I don't have one for the treasury handout 
I want all the handouts to have a related but memey picture
Did you read the exotic metals handout
Yea. I think surprised creatures should get their reaction and nothing else and surprisers get attack or move only
Yea. Maybe you get both if they're unconscious
I think surprise rounds should be movement or action not both
I guess but even then physically moving at them and attacking means they're stunned a full few seconds
Or full asleep
Like working at a quiet desk at home in a castle 
But like surprise should be only if you catch them totally off guard like not even thinking they might be attacked
You could just say attacker and attackee get to roll everyone else without observant/alert/ranger has disadvantage
That's just initiative but gay
You draw first but they draw faster
Even then it's the gunslinger again
But you're still closing the distance. They can react as you're falling
Like the goblins might ambush you but a quick ranger will still shoot before they close in
Cause like with wild west gunslinger it's not who draws first it's who's initiative is quicker
Also I was thinking of enforcing no surprise rounds unless the target is sleeping
Ik
Hmm. I think it should also be one but then it makes more sense at the end
Yea
What if they have two counters. Can they retaliate on two strikes
Idk. I think it should just have a defined time to occur
Or just keep letting it be after the first attack
Should I enforce counter attack at the end of a multi attack
Most to least likely
Most to least likely
My order is Parsa you Milo miles jett 
No jett is less
Besides Parsa who's more likely to read
You're like second most likely to read
No way
Is there too much handouts and backstory. I feel like nobody read it maybe cause it's too long
Is there too much handouts and backstory. I feel like nobody read it maybe cause it's too long
ive zoned you out too
nah i just zone out
gross no
shes fat
no wtf
but not even the real kind
no shes just autistic
bitch rants on everything
about fcking anything
anything
and is too passionate
theres some annoying ass girl in our class who talks too much
yea writing is the worst
yea its gay
so like 400
1 page

just a technical paper
t e c h n i c a l w r i t i n g
gay
i have a paper due about a paperclip
usually not
Yea. This is writing class tho so I write campaign shit
I have fucking class now until 630. Worst schedule ever
Fair but you have to buy them out then. Provide a house and land and shit
Fair but you have to buy them out then. Provide a house and land and shit
Like if I save your life in New York you probably won't move here
Like if I save your life in New York you probably won't move here
And have homes and families there too 
They have to sell from the city
But they won't necessarily move into your land tho
What's the scheme 
Could work
I'm assuming it's gemi
I'm assuming it's gemi
Plus if they move and live on the land it's not out of the way
And historically the estate used to hold certain festivals which jett agreed to let the church hold
Different saints
Read the cleric lair actions they're nuts and have no limits on usage
Yea. It's actually an insane safe room against undead fiends and shit 
And attracts peasants and shit I guess
It counts as a chapel for Lucia
Nope
At the cost of it forever being church property while they pay upkeep and staff
&quot;free&quot;
But that's 5 months away
Especially since when the temple is finished your negative income is gonna be way more negative
Sure. Still has to happen eventually tho
You guys should talk about that first
With no short term one tho
Actually everyone really
Ik. You and jett are scheming for the final play when you haven't even established financial stability or name recognition
Ik. You and jett are scheming for the final play when you haven't even established financial stability or name recognition
Ever considered how to find changelings
That's a reasonable stance
i see. it really be like that
hoes do in call or out call or both
are you in call and out call or just in calls
i expected as much lol
that wasnt much of a revelation
clearly
luckily parsa cced the other 2 friends of derg so they could kill him and bully the friends into leaving
but derg slapped them both down
it was dank overall. their 2 redfoot giants clubbed down one of dergs friends from invisibility
instead of one of the dozen smaller ones
tbf the red foots gave them the big tusks
so they got them in the end. powdered one for the alchemist and sold the other for 400gp
but they traded his head to the red foots for 2
they killed him
but derg brought friends so it ended up a battle of giants
yea. derg wanted them to kill the red foots for 5 tusks each but they convinced the red foots to ambush derg and give them 2
they fuckin killed derg man
everyone plotted their own shit and ended up inciting a giant clan battle
yea. you shouldve seen the clusterfuck that was last session
more fun than /w
ik
It'd be difficult but doable
Possibly
At least nobody can walk in
The gates work tho
So it's mildly sketchy anyway
Also only half the manor is intact
We do but knight lair lautrec and Lucia chance want to sleep in the temple ruins
theres not much stuff
dude 2 people live in a tent
Now we both know thieves cant 
Fucking phone keyboard
Yea it does. At least a thieves guild liason is useful<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1567527392939" ts="1567527392" t="61"></e_m>
Yea it does. At least a thieves guild liason is useful<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1567527392939" ts="1567527392" t="61"></e_m>
Wondering why nobody else took the offer xd
It's just you. She'd be showing up with the employment flyer a month later
No it's already been a month
Just Parsa
They're going to meet with this woman 
They're going to meet with this woman 
Do you want to introduce redeem redpenny by having her show up to the manor a month after the other recruits or as the handmaid of this noblewoman alchemist the others are meeting with
and recruits better allies
yeah but they decided a chapel is a better front
and parsa is a bard
knight lautrec is the paladin
milo is a cleric
jetts a warlock
also the keep is a paladin's chapel
cool
btw can you do friday 730
for money
for
and legitimate ventures of money
you do black market stuff for control of people
in character you probably know the cut is pretty big
its weird how everyone's first instinct is to butt into thieves guild territory
Cool I'll check it after dinner
Also he's a bit of a stalker
And what he deduced from that
He's a known informant so he knows what other houses are asking from him
He's a port beggar
Probably not
He said dragons but you know
So Milos other idea is hunt a rare creature to sell its parts for startup money
So Milos other idea is hunt a rare creature to sell its parts for startup money
Should be affordable really
Aight. The dues are 10gp a month anyway
In case petty thievery is below you
Yea. But you can also contract them too this way
Vs just skimping duties
Otherwise it's like full suspension of guild privileges and duties
Yours. If she pays she can still use guild fences and informants
Does she still pay guild dues or no
Is she still a member just doing a long term side gig now instead of guild work 
Like an informant or fence is a contractor
No like on a permanent contract vs getting paid for information or specific jobs
As an initiate or contractor
It's really gay
Jack Kelly
Alright. That's good
Who's she connected with
Ok. What about allies
Complete redo works
Yea go for it. Make some up but not too many. Or you can look at the other handouts and see. Like the hresvelgs run shipping so maybe one of them did something. 
Did you come up with bonds and enemies for missy 
and lmk what you think im missing or any other type of contact you think should be in there
want to read through the list of allies and contacts for me
good idea or bad
so money generation is really important to start
so actually house income is -130
one of which is a street informant
yea i left a handout with a handful of connections
keep
than busting into a kep
as far as robbery goes i figured a carriage would be easier
yea
sketchy places
etc
harbor
sewer
i was thinking more like map of the estate
youre supposed to be imitating noblemen
why would you ever fight in the arena
a temple
a few mines
im more thinking making a bunch of road and alley maps
but i feel like this just leads to a lot of them
i hate those improv drawn maps
true. tbh im just trying to think what to prepare
parsa told me about this thing where they murdered a tavern owner and then disguised as him to sell the place to themselves
to buy the establishment
so are you thinking robbery or what to get that first chunk of money
but with a nice keep and a house guard they should be manageable
assassinations should be expected
at some point you need to be legit to vie for status
you can only get so big with black money
getting known and gathering info at the same time
but fixing it allows for hosting events
poor investment and all
yea fixing it immediately isnt the best idea for obv reasons
As it grows then others need to be dealt with to clear your turf
Well rn the house is so destitute nobody is paying attention
Rescuing a mason. Etc
Clean money
Assassination contracts or thievery to pay masons
Black market money
Yea but there's ways to go about it
Your property is crumbling and you have a handful of farmers left in the village
So what's the first thing you'd do if you were left a barely functioning noble house
Probably going to drop the income to like 300
RN it's at 670 but that's high I feel
 500 gp with an undecided monthly income
Or being nice to get them to join
Blackmailing artisans to work for you
Or buying taverns by sabotaging them to drop the value
Recruiting is more like going to mines and clearing them out so they produce again
I want this to be do whatever
I don't want to set a path tho
You think the party will go for recruiting first or straight into sabotage and shit
Anyway. Any ideas what you want to do first
assuming miles hasnt
ik milo and jett havent
is a good place to start
well knowing what artisans can be recruited and what they can do
but its still missing a name
theres a handout with all the details on it underneath
you do know youre starting with a keep
for our autistic group
do you think the stronghold and artisans part is too complex
I'll see you then
Oh aight sick 
What's that
What
Whenever you can
I said 6 but Ik you show up late so
The one I've talked about in chat repeatedly
My birthday party
Can you make Saturday
wanna play risk
yo
we got some illegals to shoot
you here
aight bitch
you almost home
tell that bitch to fuck off too
shouldve kicked them out
i figured
how late
aight cause milos playing fire emblem
do we need full 4
wanna play then
when are you home
yea
jett and i wanna play risk of rain and you have it
yo are you home
i figured. nobody else would deal with that cancer
kevin?
who are you and parsa campaign with
trist with red buff/titanic and gunslingers blows up their whole team in 2 seconds
also you cant do the on hit cheese with vayne
nobles suck and rangers suck
yordle and gunslinger are 2 of the best comps
shes deadass probably the best 1 cost
disable everything about their team 4 at a time
you should try gunslingers except you make trist into demon with sword breaker and hush
always got a tier 3 kennen or veig
off forcing yordles every game
literally 5 game 1st place streak
tbh tho the big thing is yordles counter the shit out of the ninja/assassin comp everyones doing rn
cause they cant ult to fuck him up
yea it makes him win every 1v1
or warmog if its real 1v9
cause he takes no damage
and he 1v9s
also if you have yordles you can put demon + pd + dragon claw on gnar
cause theres 2 sorcs already so one more is synergy
the best one was kayle made into a sorcerer for literal undying team
or any other sorc
my personal preference is yordles + morg
yea if nobody else goes yordles i build it every time
and shojin is better than double seraph
you need 4 tears on him to instant ult at the start
plus the rest of the yordles
its still 800 damage
i think my build is straight up the best except if maybe the tear was static shiv
so at 3 its an instagib on anything but a 3* unit
nah you dont need deathcap his ult auto kills any unit below his star
so its just pop pop any non 3*
then only needs 2 autos to go again
but deadass this bitch starts every fight with ult up
he had 3 sorc boost tho
i stacked him with seraph shojin and a tear
just wtf
level 3 veigar ult hits 22k on any 2* or lower unit
somehow going back in time has given evandar a touch of planar magic
ive learned something from the teleporter fuck up
but tbh i like horizon walker cause its more flavorful
you can 1v1
but the gloom stalker cheese is any creature that doesnt have blindsight in darkness
so thats the horizon walker cheese
without ropes
or really you climb super fast
yea so you can kind of fly
you can blink to them 20ft at a time
but if theres platforms
and go 10ft each time
no cause you can only attack 2 times in 6 seconds
and teleport upwards
means  you can just shoot at walls
combined with that it specifies ANY unoccupied space and not any place on the ground
and just blink around
out of combat
is you can take attack actions against inanimate objects
the funny thing about the horizon walker teleporting before attacks tho
nah you dont have to be
or smth
it should be a glaive ranger
tbh tho horizon walker just feels like
but close quarters shooter + horizon walker is pretty good
i was thinking of taking two weapon fighting at 6 for my second fighting style
when you hve 20 dex
medium armor sucks
is d10
nah its the ranger hit die
with 4 con more
hmm youre not even that much over me lol
autism rogue
its honestly easier to just go elsewhere
well i have no attachment to it anymore
place sucks anyway
yea thats my opinion on what to do
but rn i think its always gonna be
my point was i figured we'd be done with the scripted part 
anyway
or there couldve been a roof
just weird
it wasnt that bad
of the church
but had to go in the front
yea when we tried to climb the walls
like with the walls and shit
idk i think its just cause he doesnt go off the script
nah no matter what it would happen
like jett was right we only ended up there cause milo didnt have anything else prepped
i mean it was just scuffed as fuck
so i didnt pay much attention to how it started
starting when the trial did
idk. i played tft
there were 3 days
then melt the bars
i mean idk why he didnt wait for them to leave
to get your keep
its like WoW you need to build rep
i just wanna do some open world questing shit
tbh tho i thought we'd be done with the scripted part of the story by now tho
true
scuffed
lul
or else you cant do the force damage thing
where you need to be 30ft
tbh i like horizon walker except the part
after being hit
horizon walker gets to reaction become resistant
and 15 you get to use reaction to give an attack disadvantage
also you can reroll 1 missed attack at 11 vs teleporting 10ft before every attack
just this feature
yes
wisdom save proficiency vs eherealness
disguise self/rope trick/fear vs pfge/misty step/haste
like +30ft darkvision and invisibility to other's darkvision
well gloom stalker has other stuff
lul
wtf did you do
ik
or fat turn 1 ambush and invisibility in darkness
fr tho do you think short range consistent damage and mobility with some portal cheese stuff
im bored
league or talk
yea. if you figure it out lmk. hopefully soon
still dont know?
until june right
so youre working yea
do you know if your schedules ever getting fixed
Ok wait in front of wahlburgers
Are you like a block out

Ok I'm coming
Where are you rn
Building is SCI
That's the room 
You here yet?
Aight I'll see you in a bit then
C'mon
Mars
It's value
I'll give you 10 bucks and there's free pizza
Ay legit tho come tomorrow
Get over
You're closer than me and it's 15 min for me
id look like a goddamn prince
but in taiwan if i had no tan and just stayed skinny
and muscular
see the problem is all the girls here want tan
and not ruin it by going swimming and tanning
so i want my kid to inherit that
mine is naturally pasty white which is basically as noble looking as it gets
also because the ideal child is pale as hell and those tend to have the lightest skin
because mainlanders since communismm are good for nothing pieces of shit ruining their country, east asia, and the world at large
and certainly no modern mainlander dna
not the 1900's fleeing communist mainland 
or 1600's mainland chinese immigrated to taiwan
the definition im thinking of is either native aboriginal blood
its rare dude
and most are tainted with at least some mainlander dna
since im looking for a pure blood taiwanese one like me
yea. i mean ideally though the perfect girl is pretty difficult to find
so solving that is all i need
the biggest worry is they wont look like the pure blooded should
theres no way with my genes and my future wifes they wont be top percentile or higher intellectually
ill have one for sure
i mean as long as i can ensure my kid is a pale skin, dark eye, dark hair, pure asian gened girl
and various other more simple cognitive abilities
though they can choose traits that improve memory
cant be picked
but at the same time, more complex things like intellect which is dna coded across thousands of pairings on various chromasomes
and theres certainly a ton of liberals that will fight for it to be illegal
meaning though its available it may not be legal
however, its also a highy controversial subject
youd be able to ensure your kids get the recessive
and marry a woman who also does
you can if you posses recessive white skin tone genes
or edit live genomes
no they cant implant the cured embryos
since its so recent
so its going to be a decision we will probably face when we have kids
based on traits dormant or active in the parents genome
like eye color, hair color, skin tone, etc
however, we are on the brink of being able to &quot;design&quot; our babies in simple cosmetic ways
but that due to legality the embryos must be terminated after 14 days and cannot be implanted in a human womb
that i dont really want to type out
through a lot of advanced protein-ribosome mechanics
to remove downs and other birth defects
like did you know currently scientists have succesfully used CRISPR to edit the genome of a human embryo
it helps for both trivia and technical interviews
like about CRISPR or modern graphics optimization
cause every now and then they list relevant and modern ones
i get them off the professors pages
sometimes when its intersting
ill read academic papers for intellectual reasons
fantasy is for adventure and drama
if i want intellectual stimulation im not reading fantasy
basically
or inversely you expect the horrible
because the characters are the way they are now
you know nothing bad will happen in it
the past is the past
otherwise its just not intersting
i need stuff happening
also if you havent noticed every book is a specific characters flashback
thats what makes it interesting
theres always too much in the present
and the feel
like seeing the Recreance ruins the mystery
its not as mysterious and interesting once its spelled out
hard outweighs stuff from the past
stuff happening in the present
ew no
Boom 
Total is 63 vs 45
And kingkiller is a 9 and a 5
See Stormlight is a 7 on character and a 9 on events
Better than well developed people do nothing at all
Yea Abe that book sucks
Like you go scene to scene but stuff doesn't change much
Imagine a game where stuff rarely happens
A story that isn't about events... What
But I think the point of stories is to tell of events
Colloquially I'll call it a theme
Whatever you want to call it
Motif
It has to be 10 books
10 is a theme
10 essences
10 orders
And it's thematic to the cosmere
10 books is enough
It should be a long drawn out battle
It wouldn't be a good story to defeat a God quickly and easily
The series wouldn't ever finish if it slowed 
If it had more actual things happening it'd be exponentially better
Idk. I still think it's just missing too many events
Yea but I feel like he plays into the fantasy of dumb people to be a prodigy and half ass everything
Cause it's too normal and I know in reality there's no grand feeling of it
But personally it just doesn't make for a compelling character
Maybe it's novel for others
Since brilliance is relative
Maybe not
Er
I feel like a lot of others will be like me though you feel
Like basically I don't get a sense of wonder from his magic system and the Arcanum because it's just my actual life lol
He makes bad choices and antagonize people 
You see where I'm going
The protagonist is a prodigy in said system and drifts through classes
Sounds like my life
Magic is a complex system only the most brilliant can understand
So it's just so mundane even though it's fantasy
So everything falls away because it's so easy
And only have one real goal
I know exactly what it's like to be the brightest but not have the means or motivation
I can pretty much predict kvothe by what I would do
And feel their thoughts
And see their side
I much prefer books where I can get into the minds of another
It's like a biography of myself
Talented, brilliant, lazy, self serving
For him not to be normal
I relate far too much with him
Because normality is boring
Normal people don't make for good story characters
It doesn't make for a good story
The ones relatable and normal
They're the ones real people have
Yea but his flaws aren't interesting imo
He's brilliant but a dog
Kvothe is selfish and unrepentant, scheming and cowardly
I think he alone is a more complex character than kvothe
Not who he is
And that his entire reputation is because of what he has 
And realizing his power was inherited, not earned
Adolin is a man struggling to come to terms with becoming nobody from being the center of the world
Shallan is always naive
Kal is headstrong
Wise
And only dalinar or jasnah are write
It's fantasy. I took it should be dramatic
Forceful or dramatic
It's about self discovery as much as heroism
Because they're children almost
They haven't learned everything
I think it's just making characters more human
In context though it's far more moving than any line in kingkiller
&quot;Accept the pain, but don't accept you deserved it&quot;
&quot;Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing&quot;
&quot;i will protect those I hate, even if the one I hate most is myself&quot;
Ya just pick one. And remind others it's a thing. 
also what was the cringest fuckin pm<e_m ts="1539539034" ts_ms="1539539035498" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
But your idea is better for now
Especially the last
I was kinda thinking of one of the last two
The more extreme option was drop both and start again. New setting either like an adventurers school like the magicians or Harry Potter style, a guild with jobs and stuff like fairy tail, or the elven rebellion of the first war
It
I like how we were both thinking jut
Yea. You do that
Yea ik 
We should drop atlas
yea cause youre a fag
4
Ask Parsa lol
No 
Good. At least he finished the game before quitting 
Less anime
Aight. Understandable
Who would be better as like a temp npc to join. Verellion or an elf
Badass of the series
Dalinar is a beast tho
And king T
Also fuck moash
It's a different world but it ties in
Get on warbreaker then
Bro
Hey. Finish oathbringer
His soul was corrupted and ravaged by lillith. If anything he's a demon now
And so the dawnbringers helped rinasel free them since they also hate the northerners
But not all went. Just most
Yea. Also they revealed the elves were trapped in the abyss by the Daughter because they chose to try and end her there
Yea I'm gonna be 10 late
Yea. Minus 50 dkp for everyone
You'll see
Nah kal and jasnah only
Nah kal and jasnah only
Azure lol. You should read warbreaker 
That's what's good
Only villains do that
Nah that's a shit ship 
The creepy spren
Good name
Yea lol
Are you at alethkar in oathbringer yet
Nice. I'm on &quot;break&quot; watching the playground for the next hour or so
When are you getting home
But just... Nothing edgy
If any give you a good char then you can give them the join link and I'll make them a sheet
What. You can't do it from mobile
Aight. If you want, put me in a Skype with them and I can help too 
And any background so we can weed the edges
Sounds kind of great. See what class/race they want
That's... Not names or details
Can you tell me about any. All guys I assume. Any names or details
Or our age
Like old people 
And did anyone pm
Anyone cool
Lul
The replies... Auto send pms tho
Actually I saw three responses
So persuasive
Wow mars. So eloquent
Exksdee
Everything
You dumb thot you use that for ensuring
Like from before 
Wait I already know it
Make a throw away idiot
Well I do now
Lul. Gj
No I mean just make a post and see who's not an edgy fucker
There's a whole sub for it. R//lfg
You wanna do the recruitment 
Well either way I wanted more than 4 and this may be the time to find better role players online anyway
Idk. Never felt like that to me
Just memes
Even gemi 
You know what tho. Milo was one of the only memes people. I honestly think online players might be better
Kal was just a slave
Dalinars are badass. The memory of a man who literally made a kingdom
Dalinar flashbacks are best flashbacks
Dalinar flashbacks are best flashbacks
Damn. It's really addicting
Nice. Also how far into oathbringer at re you
Like which days are best
When do you work until
And have vaguely pointed ears
Ik. That's the problem of his design tho. The Royal line has narrow and angular features so he's gonna look older
He looks like he's in his twenties when he's a teen 
Yea but he's supposed to look younger
And I can't even work on it rn cause no iPad
I wish I had done Anariel in pencil. He looks so dark because of pen 
I'm so bored at work rn
Ik. He's just damage tho
Yea I've seen it. I haven't needed any enemies to be super smart tho since y'all just run at them with no cc or battle controlling spells
Abrasion and progression
Yea. It's her order
Lift has a short book too. It's pretty good
But my favorite thing ever is just adolin murdering sadeas for being a bitch 
There's a real good ideal in oathbringer
Like shallans suck. But as it reveals more like kal it gets better
The revealed ideals get better and better
Also the third wind runner ideal is so good
Fuck sadeas
Syl and pattern too 
Is pretty great
The irony of them hating each other
And adolin. The duels and kal. So good
Act 3 kaladin 
She straight murders a bitch
Shallan is secretly og 
Fuck tyn
Yea
When does shallan use one in wor 
&quot;The hidden weapon only ten heartbeats away&quot;
The chapter with the thieves and jasnah
She hinted at one yea
What do you mean
You gotta read words of radiance. Is somehow more epic than way of kings
Lol. That was a good reveal
Feels bad to be szeth
Fuck tara
Like how kal saw things
The things she's seeing. It's obvious she has one
I am a stick 
Earlier
It was way easier
As Jesus intended
Wine to blood
I mean after the whole soul casting thing
It's just not explicit
Well it's pretty obvious
<e_m a="live:eric_3116" ts_ms="1529118052174" ts="1529118052" t="61"></e_m>
Shallans is dank af 
All the radiant spren are amazing characters
And syls revelation that she isn't windspren
Like he just summoned his blade in the middle of the enemy camp
I also love how ready adolin was to kill sadeas
My favorite part was sacrificing his own blade for the bridge men 
Also recognizing he isn't the peacemaker after all
But he still just clean sweeps the king
Yea. His own plate was already smashed to shit and he had no blade
You'll see
Finish 69 and let's talk
Really early. Same with his Words
It manages to be better than kal vs the shardbearer 
Tower
The fucking tier
I hated mine
Ew. Who celebrates that
It's six there right
Just finish 69: Justice. It's so good
Elhokar is just average while the rest are the best at something
All the kholins except elhokar are amazing
Fuck you. I love adolin 
The bait and switch
The feast and strap right
Oh wait you're close to 69 if freed dalinar of guilt means what I think
Are you before or after jasnahs lesson
It's hard to stop
Same. I read all of oathbringer between the plane rides these last few days
And I want to talk about it
Cause 69 is the best one
What chapter are you
How's syl doing
Idk. What chapter are you on
Well it gets more interesting. Also they all use bridge men. Sadeas just uses his as bait
Sadeas is a cuck 
Sadeas has no blade
Fuck sadeas
Yea. See faster tho
Lol. I was thinking a later one
I wanna know if it was the moment I'm thinking of 
which chapter
You see the bible I got for milo
Go for it
Yea it's just a one shot and he's going to become a legendary figure regardless
Where's the monastery
Yea I can see that
So what are their beliefs then
Well you already know it irl
Ok. Fair enough
Tbh I'm just waiting until gemi finds out what waiting so long has caused
Sure. It'll make her happy
Yea. I figured 19 and 20 basically makes your spell as powerful as one from the old days
I mostly meant the echo
The lightning might force you to hit allies
Yea. There's two really good ones though
It's seventy five twenty five good too bad but some good stuff is chance to fuck you
There
Yea but it sucks if you throw aoe and four rounds later they just aren't three
You do you. I'm just in it for magical railguns and shit
I've got empty lists that I fill what they are after I use a name
Yea exactly
Boom. Done
Like just have names and when you need an npc/god with that kind of name
I just kinda made it when I needed it
Like I didn't have xolruthar prepped
But eventually you end up winging it anyway
That's not bad
That's not bad
Ew. You can legit do one race at a time
Much easier lol
Ik. I make them when it's need
The original idea was a human who was an experiment to see how powerful a wizard they could create but wasnt as good as the others they made so he fell in as a bounty hunter 
So they're a bit busy
They also watch over the plane of fire like the tritons guard the plane of water
Their imperial arm is long and reaches across much of the continent but they perpetually fight the northerners and eladrin they share a continent with
Honestly I've got like 3 pages of info to either have some npc explain or just post to chat
I'll put off anything bigger until you get there
Ok. I think I can make the rest of his choices knowing that
you game
^
^
game?
im on mc with mars
or league
you wanna hop on mc
so you league or not
i believe this is a thing called irony
aight gl on valorant ig
or just play league
well you can play alone then
i uninstalled it
leauge
nothing matters
the worlds ending
flex?
wow
no really
are you still on tower defense duty
just dont 4head
and you can go home
hopefully they start shooting looters
lmao
fucko
i see you in clash
did you go to work today
you ready?
xd
i run on anger and resentment
idk im feeling pretty good
Cause they can all go fuck themselves
So I'm just spending time away from them now
I put in so much more into that campaign than anyone else and it feels like nobody cared or appreciated it
Ah no. DND fell apart and Rn I just donâ€™t want to talk to any of them
Mostly Milo but Parsaâ€™s always inthere. Just cause
Aight. Personally I can say fuck Milo and Parsa and kind of Jett 
for me it was the people
was it the spam or some particular goon
Yea. 
Havenâ€™t talked to any of the people in like a week
Idk I feel. I left it too
Gwyn I see
whyd you leave the other group chat
Pce 
I gotta sleep. Work and shit at 10
<ss type="puke">(puke)</ss>
Aight. Really think about it. Itâ€™s a major life decision but I think itâ€™s a good one 
shes infinitely more compassionate than me 
if you wanna talk lmk or you can contact my mom
you read it over and think about it any more?
yo
although if you ever get a phd im gonna call you dr.dig
the one you want to do determines if you go for a master's or a doctorate
or management/research that helps to develop new methods and a higher-level view
depending on if youre interested in going into fieldwork like handling individual cases for people
but from what I know there are 2 tracks, professional and academic
you should talk to my mom cause she knows the field a lot more than I do
and the government pays off your loans
anyway you have questions about social work. i think its pretty fit for you
ah. i was right
btw is milos birthday today or tmrw i always forget
if you like it you could even do a phd with her eventually or smth
my mom is a professor in that field and industrial engineering and im sure she'd help you get into a good school for it
anyway i brought it up cause its a lot less academically rigorous than other fields but also cause youre basically the exact demographic that goes into the field
the skills are basically people skills
to try and get them on their feet, get them benefits, etc
orphans
like you work with homeless or poor or even addicts
social work is a field for people who like to help others
instead of nursing or w/e it was
also i dont remember what you said you were working on but have you considered going into social work
its a program you do after graduation focused on developing skills
decentralized consensus tech
bitcoin/ethereum
to try and get into blockchain development
doing a post-grad fellowship
maybe in 5-7 weeks
im gonna be really busy this month
Xd
you wanna play mc or league
discord
leauge
video quality is key for me tho
your call
so good for watching things
i like my 2540x1600 tho
yea thats good
yea their monitors are nice af. mine is like 5 years at this point and still solid
also idk about monitors really but i always liked my asus ones

Nutty. I'm no reception once I get into the park

She said something like she only really needs help around lunch
â€­+1 (510) 366-0027â€¬
Yea it's July 4th and 5th. The expo is 9-6 I'll give you Christina's number for the details
so probably in a few hours
christinas coming today
yea
im never playing real league again
the day it drops
ik
since the league servers are down anyway
like now
yea. all summer
im gonna go to the century city mall cause theres a store there that sells pots
2 do you want to work christinas table at AX for 2-3 days. she has an extra helper pass so you can get in free in exchange for basically doing your regular retail job at her table
1 did you buy a fathers day gift yet and if not do you wanna go get one with me
i got 2 things to ask you
yo
5 minutes
yea
you missed parsa and jett
did you ever get that chinese vn game
like the plan wasnt to quit league for 4 months it just kinda happened
maybe later this week. i plan on playing again sometime but havent been able to with christina here and doing other stuff recently
Like time off to eat
Ya. Do you get dinner or anything
Damn. Unfortunate
What time
Yaa
Until the afternoon
I'm not dealing with it any more
I unfriended his ass on every platform
Yea well fuck him
Like shit dude I didn't realize you're supposed to int kills in dota
As if dota is any different
And then if you ever ask him to do anything he jyst says &quot;i don't play this dumb game&quot;
Doesn't contest or counter gank
Gives kills
He just always ganks badly
Idk I do. Everyone else when they play for fun goes full fiesta and gets a million kills
But Parsas play style just sucks for us all
We just chill and play memes with Michael and shit
No I'm literally playing for fun with Milo every day
If you wanna do anything
Anyway I'm in town
And won't even listen to shot calls because he thinks he knows better
He makes the worst decisions and doesn't try to learn
Like he's just unapologetically the worst player we know and demands his role which is my main just to be somewhat useful
And then says it's my fault I didn't call to hit the adc
Giving ez time to kill me cause he wasn't stunned
And last hits the sona
Not until he comes and runs past the braum marked ez
Then his dumb ass comes along and ruins it 
Yea but I was trying so hard to be honorable and succeeding
Fucking unreal
First day I play with him I uninstall
Like I went all week chill and having fun on league
While he thinks about his toxic ways
I just wanted pata kicked for a few days
Idk why you people are trying to change
It's not high school drama
And to get over himself
If you have Parsa in there tell him he's a salty cuck
Ok then
Also why do you keep leaving there group chat 
We had 5 last time
We figured. You have to be really argumental and manipulative to be good at it
I'm gonna eat and go
I'll be back at like 5
I'm still at the zoo
But you can also come out
We're at the door
Either way she's getting told it online
I'm literally across the pacific from her
I'm doing that 
Can't you
Yea 
It's such a meme
Yea 
I won a penis rabbit just now
Giant malls to hang in. Etc
Hot girls everywhere at night markets. Cheap food that's really good. 
8/10. Hot as fuck and boring without a friend but with Kelly it's been really fun
It's better than I expected
I saw the solo movie tho
Ironically I'm at a uniqlo rn
Not bad. I'll drop by and harass you 
Yikes. Nah in the states bitches hang at the beach
The only place girls my age are in this city is school
Uh huh
Cause uni here isn't out yet and I'm super rusty on Asian flirting 
Nobody to hang with and it's too early to look for girls or drink
And I'm still bored
So I got to Taiwan but it's 5am. I'm bored
Aight
Coming?
Soon ish
Yea
We're going soon
Just come over
Do you want to come to ramen with Milo and I for dinner

From the player's basic rules page 106 and 107:

Paralyzed â€¢ A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condi- tion) and canâ€™t move or speak. â€¢ The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. â€¢ Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. â€¢ Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

Unconscious â€¢ An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), canâ€™t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. â€¢ The creature drops whatever itâ€™s holding and falls prone. â€¢ The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. â€¢ Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. â€¢ Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

After being called sexist, Bear Grylls added a women's team to survival reality show The Island. In the first 3 days, the women were lost in the jungle, injured, without fire, water, food, or shelter.
society has crumbled
this is now a disney princess
life isnt worth living

Milo ree
Yea actually can we decide so I know if I'm going back to the dorm

reeeee
m e a o
meao
hes a holy man
milos eao is a frontlining beast
inb4 &quot;yea she died in the last 3 hours&quot;

still, so far looks like 4 works
you do the weird ass system
oh right
last time you didn't get back until 4

i never realized a poll could tilt me like this
its just Michael and mars then
whatever

or like wtf
is he gonna put yours
so if you put milos name
I'm gonna fucking kill myself
nigger you have a name
milo

we need mars you and michael
just answer the damn poll
but in the other way
and getting stoned
as does adultery
getting raped stones you
being real bored doesn't stone you
cmonbruh
you sound like youre high as shit but we all know youre too much of a bitch to smoke at home
what the fuck is wrong with you
no cause some people change their schedule all the time
bitch what
and not everybody answered
a while ago
we asked in this chat
good meme?

thursday
that's some fucked up shit
camp pain
hey but fr tho
that's a 5 year sentence
&quot;I DIDNT KNOW I HAD TO GET A PERMIT TO FIREBOLT IN CAVERNS&quot;
would fuck you so bad
the mosha lawsuits
magical osha
mosha
I thought that was obvious
all citizenry wear magical bracelets so that you cannot hide from guards
hey, practicing stealth is highly illegal
all wands must be licensed and holstered at the hip
concealed carry now illegal
its an assault sword
at that point
why would citizenry need swords longer than 3ft
and assault swords
for magical violations
youre all in jail
after quest 1
lmao
ez clap
&quot;15 to life&quot;
&quot;shit&quot;
&quot;and can we see your fireball paperwork&quot;
&quot;I cast fireball on it and...&quot;
&quot;and will you please tell the jury how you killed this bone devil&quot;
and youre just tryna be a fucking adventurer
everything needs a permit
modern magic
that would be the most meme of all meme campaigns
aww lame
but that would need a permit
I could see people running therapy shops where all they do is mind wipe your trauma
thaumaturgy is not to be cast during any form of bartering
Fuckin MOSHA is serous shit
Teleportation circles need a permit
If animals and or plants are spoken to, you may not upset them
Conjured drinks - water only
Otherwise you risk discrimination suits 
Created food must be vegan as to be complaint with all races
No lightning within a hundred meters of water
Verbal consent required
Healing on the willing only
Weather affecting spells on personal property only
Any acid and curses need a special permit
Any and all aoe spells need a license otherwise how do we know you know the exact area
Otherwise we're at risk of being liable for your miscalculation and injury of coworkers
Can't be allowed to cast one unless you're licensed
Being able to eye a twenty foot radius is hard
Do you have a fireball verification
Yea
Yea. Any licensed party needs a counterspell to avoid workplace arcane hazards 
Gotta keep MOSHA off our ass 
We need a counter spell
Once a day
I eat berries
absolutelynot_us_irl
Every adventuring party should be Adventure LEGAL. Are you...

Long journey ready? Nobody appreciates how long they'll be away from civilisation 'til they run out of rations and realise nobody knows basic survival!

Evil aware? Did you know that one in five adventurers are unlawfully homicidal and/or in direct contact with devils? What are the signs you're being manipulated?

Geared up? What do you mean &quot;we forgot the health potions&quot;? Medical supplies and camping gear are as important as weapons and armour!

Abjuration trained? What can YOU do when faced with a fireball? Every party should have at least one member who knows how to interpret and counter magic!

Licenced? Guild membership, identification, even a simple library card can make all the difference. Don't rely on reputation, carry your documents with you or have copies sent to the major cities!
Yea
It's annoying
Like 50cs+ and you're marked 
You get recognized
The second you have a good game
Even better ulu
It's like 3
Michael go right back to inting
Oof
Campaign
Oh. Then thats the face after your support misses the stun 4 times 
Is that from high school. I have short hair in it
Unfortunate
When
Campaign
.
no its fucked up to ask for gender equality
that's fucked up
no
its probably a chick that wrote it
like xayah and rakan its always better in pairs
did someone say valentines day double xp palooza
I can see it
tried for equal rights
had an interest in the tailor shop
idk he likes to cook potions
just like braccus thinks he has humanoid rights
shes a feminist piece of shit instead ok
unka is kyle
I dont
we do?
eao is mmba

shut the fuck up
you goddamn clown
the stirling engine is as simple as it gets
simple
then push them together when filled with metal
make 2 molds
also i wouldn't try to image the whole 3d part, just half of it
into imagining patterns
as long as I'm not tryna dex my way
but its wis
yea
id assume its whatever pattern you want it to be
shaping patterns
You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
I'm not gonna try to forge screws
those would be cast
smaller cylinders attached to rods
its just cylinders
hardware
cheating the casting to be wis is enough
and welding them with fire
assembling it sure but with good molds its just sliding pieces together
and it shapes itself
its just imagining how you want the earth to be
shaping the molds with magic is just to cheat the dex check
coming up with the idea
isn't that what the initial int check is
and create tons of mold types
i can mold earth a for an hour
but sure
these aren't particularly complicated shapes tho
sure but he has literally no way to make the molds
id actually do that until parsa shows
and who gets to coin the term horsepower/not horsepower
for who invents an engine first
hector and unka vs eao and vix
could just be a team race
in like any way
if its a race unka doesn't win
sterling engine done. horsepower never exists
ez
with produce flame/ray of frost
then to power it just heat the hot chamber and cool the other
have engine
pour into molds
then melt down a sword with one of many fire spells
because its extremely precise
mold earth to create the metal molds
at least its easy and plausible
as not horsepower
just to be the one who gets to define the term for engine capacity
nah literally the most basic ass sterling engine ever
as a young boy, vix tried to boil a potion but sealed the top of the bottle by accident. the potion exploded and he got minor burns and cuts but realized that boiling water in an enclosed space generate force
at least vix has seen it
boiled water-&gt;steam-&gt;movement
alchemist pipes
also no, we've seen things similar to how engines work
it transcends worlds
my hatred for the term horsepower is so strong
a tube system
you just need a few cylinders
instead of trying to forge an ic engine...
and using magic to cast the metal
luckily I'm only going for the stirling engine
10x easier than forging
pour into mold
heat metal the raw steel
earth shape a mold
instead of trying to forge it
i figured id use magic to shape the metal
there are pretty tight tolerances on engines
what, are you an experience blacksmith
for either engine
well it needs really precisely manufactured parts
instead of making everyone listen to it later
so we can go right to the skill checks
milo you want me to explain rn how to build a stirling engine
unka could build an engine
theres no fuckin way
so ill build a magical stirling engine
and i don't really want to go learn how build an ic engine
to eliminate the horsepower measurement
i just want to build one in eluras
I'm not hating on it
stiriling engines are easy
yea i mean ive built one before its not that hard
while id have to go research how to build an ic engine
mostly cause i know exactly how to build one in case milo makes me describe how i build it
yes
like while you drive it just drains your spell slots
just magic powered
its like an electric engine
i could still kill you
instead of fuel
an enchanted item that provides the heat
actually tho a magical steam engine would be pretty cool
what I'm building
unka youd have no fuckin idea
if horsepower never becomes invented
worth it
feels4eman
monkaS
skill challenges
also whats the int check to invent a steam engine
is better
a quantifying measurement
no dumbasses
so if theres no tradition
with a better unit of measurment
and measure engine strength
also the original statement i had was we should invent cars in eluras
it doesn't hurt
again you can just compare the numbers in the quantifying measurement to other cars
which is strictly superior in function
so it is both a quantifying and qualifying measurement
with exacter numbers
you can compare that too
as opposed to &quot;I'm buying a 700 newton-meter, 400/700 rpm engine&quot;
yea &quot;I'm buying a 400hp engine. idk how much that is in any other units of measurement but i bought it anyway&quot;
its just a faÃ§ade that keeps average people from being able to know exactly what theyre buying
in any way based on the term &quot;horsepower&quot;
i cant numerate that strength
I can relate to how strong a horse is
on a unit of measurement that hasn't been relatable since the 1900s
and I don't want to guess the strength of my engine
because theyre different
you can return 1 number for both
front and rear axle
you degenerate animal
aka rotations per second
power is torque x angular speed
by saying &quot;400hp&quot;
instead of somewhat relatable and guestimated amounts of both
now you have exact measurements for both
boom
&quot;this engine has 700 newton-meters of torque and an angular speed of 40 rotations per second&quot;
you don't need one term to do both. engines can be measured by their max torque AND by their angular speed
that exists only for marketing purposes and tradition
so you admit its a suboptimal term
their engine strength
but people would also be able to exactly know
yea but if we raised people on newton-meters theyd also have a good estimate
they can only roughly guess
nobody in the world will ever see 400hp and know how much torque it is exactly
that doesn't mean that horsepower is the optimal way of communicating engine strength
but either way
electric cars get more than 400hp
that's the strength of about 25 horses
that's pretty shit
who targets high horsepower cars at dumb people
call it that then and it still makes sense
kilogram-meters-per second * meter
newton meters is pretty easy
its like sticking with imperial measurements
horsepower is outdated by this point
and the conclusion was that newton-meters was a more elegant measurement
and we had the longest debate ever over this
I went to a mech e class
also yea horsepower triggers me
sports cars are the ones that advertise their horsepower
and if they aren't they aren't really worried about the horsepower of their engine
tend to be educated
people who buy cars
people take physics courses
last time I saw one was like 2 years ago
when was the last time you saw a horse drawn carriage
and a human is a 5 horsepower engine
also horsepower is meaningless cause a horse is technically a 15 horsepower engine
means something
at least saying &quot;9000 foot pound&quot; engine
its meaningless to almost everybody
because horsepower sucks
is better than horsepower
honestly even calling the measurement foot-pounds
are you implying only americans buy cars tho
its just one that uses obscure units
horsepower already is a measurement of torque
a newton meter is a more refined version of foot pound
what the fuck a foot pound is
how are you gonna explain to anyone outside america
that's not obscure
torque is newton-meters
more people buying cars have taken a physics course than lived with or ridden horses
you lived on a farm with horses or smth
than horsepower?
torque is more obscure
watts
or like
if it was defined in units of torque it would be far more useful for immediate determination of engine strength
like ok
that engine strong
its like saying &quot;strong&quot;
its literally a worthless unit of measurement because its too obscure for the normal person to define in a meaningful way
do you know how much horsepower one horse is capable of
do you know what horsepower is a measurement of
how much int does it take to make a steam engine
because that eventually becomes an obscure and useless unit of measurement
that isn't horsepower
just so we can coin a term for engine strength
what do we have to roll to invent cars
i gotta work on my trust fund
and how much is real estate
or set amount of years
is it based on racec
whats the jail sentences like in eluras
gotta get diverse
vaughan is a crappy rogueish personailty already
mostly a healer
ulu
eao is the train tracks

just pick braccus and vaughan
but really
canon
top 2
c a n o n
its canon now
your character is just a furry
its ok
so its gotta be braughan
like hunka isn't possible cause theyre both straight
nah braughan is canon
druids fuck trees
the canon couple
2 ex slaves
Vaughan fucks animals
so
braughan is the only one that's canon
also
its all about the name
braughan is the new thing
boo
oof
#braughan
yea but that title
or riot
Gandalf lied, he was no wizard. He was clearly a high level fighter that had put points in the Use Magic Device skill allowing him to wield a staff of wizardry. All of his magic spells he cast were low level, easily explained by his ring of spell storing and his staff. For such an epic level wizard he spent more time fighting than he did casting spells. He presented himself as this angelic demigod, when all he was a fighter with carefully crafted PR.

His combat feats were apparent. He has proficiency in the long sword, but he also is a trained dual weapon fighter. To have that level of competency to wield both weapons you are looking at a dexterity of at least 17, coupled with the Monkey Grip feat to be able to fight with a quarter staff one handed in his off hand at that. Three dual weapon fighting feats, monkey grip, and martial weapon proficiency would take up 5 of his 7 feats as a wizard, far too many to be an effective build. That's why when he faced a real wizard like Sarumon, he got stomped in a magic duel. He had taken no feats or skills useful to a wizard. If he had used his sword he would have carved up Sarumon without effort.

The spells he casts are all second level or less. He casts spook on Bilbo to snap him out his ring fetish. When he's trapped on top of Isengard an animal messenger spell gets him help. Going into Moria he uses his staff to cast light. Facing the Balrog all he does is cast armor. Even in the Two Towers his spells are limited. Instead of launching a fireball into the massed Uruk Hai he simply takes 20 on a nature check to see when the sun will crest the hill and times his charge appropriately. Sarumon braced for a magic duel over of the body of Theodin, which Gandalf gets around with a simple knock on the skull. Since Sarumon has got a magic jar cast on Theodin, the wizard takes the full blow as well breaking his concentration. Gandalf stops the Hunters assault on him by parrying two missile weapons, another fighter feat, and then casting another first level spell in heat metal. Return of the King has Gandalf using light against the Nazgul and that is about it. When the trolls, orcs and Easterlings breach the gates of Minos Tiroth does he unload a devastating barrage of spells at the tightly pack foes? No, he charges a troll and kills it with his sword. That is the action of a fighter, not a wizard.

Look at how he handled the Balrog, not with sorcery but with skill. The Balrog approached and Gandalf attempts to intimidate him, clearly a fighter skill. After uses his staff to cast armor, a first level spell, Gandalf then makes a engineering check, another fighter skill, to see that the bridge will not support the Balrog's weight. When the Balrog took a step, the bridge collapsed under its weight. Gandalf was smart enough to know the break point, and positioned himself just far enough back not to go down with the Balrog. The Balrog's whip got lucky with a critical hit knocking Gandalf off balance. The whole falling part was due to a lack of over sight on behalf of the party, seriously how does a ranger forget to bring a rope? Gandalf wasn't saved by divine forces after he hit the bottom, he merely soaked up the damage because he was sitting on 20d10 + constitution bonus worth of hit points.

So why the subterfuge? Because it was the perfect way to lure in his enemies. Everybody knows in a fight to rush the wizard before he can do too much damage. But if the wizard is actually an epic level fighter, the fools rush to their doom. Gandalf, while not a wizard, is extremely intelligent. He knows how his foes would respond. Nobody wants to face a heavily armored dwarf, look at Gimli's problem finding foes to engage in cave troll fight. But an unarmored wizard? That's the target people seek out, before he can use his firepower on you. If the wizard turns out to actually be a high level fighter wearing robes, then he's already in melee when its his turn and can mop the floor with the morons that charged him. So remember fighters, be like Gandalf. Fight smarter, not harder.
getting that silk lingerie
eao is a thotty?
youd save money on dinner
reeeeeee
420
hey miles
one sec
were having a discussion here tho
i would but im at home and not in the dorm
and a commoner at that
but he was just a human
or second
nope i definitely killed that first thief
afterwards
you shot me reeeeeeeeeeeee
you shot me
in the dungeon
he shot me
attempted murder
hes definitely the bard
and the silliness
vaugn mostly does the murdering
mostly vaugn
or murdering people
were always silly
that top part is meme shit
meme? thats quality roleplaying
its just a wizard who only takes necro spells
def not
yea
yea well a necromancer is just a really late healer anyway
diego
do we have a necromancer because i feel we need a healer
we know
gift me lunar empress lux and ill duo with you
.
eat pokis ass in davids place
be the third
two people already sniped toast today
oh
wait you saw them and didnt snipe them when they were in the bakery
sad
no balls
stream sniper extrodinaire
everyone would know the legend of mars blackman
itd be dank
i mean just walk over and say histo twitch chat
theyre in a korean restaurant with noodle house in the name
baguette
close to the paris baguteet
to streamsnipe or not to streamsnipe
toast in koreatown rn
I am now
I heard mention of league
its lit
I'm out of class for the week
hell yea we should do that
like 3 years ago there was hail/snow
it did that one time
reegue
Chill
Its not ninety minutes 
Walking back. 10 min
so we can stick to 6?
I'm busy 5-6
close to blue
is there team
in that case
im just seeing if its gonna be soon
im not saying start rn
I'm assuming hes free
hes on league
so are we all here
where you at team
ye
that sounds pretty lit
watch this instead
leaves
giraffes eat
ok
well
league it is then?
isn't a hard choice
I mean league or campaign
same
why don't you have the day shift
so Friday.sat.sun are good
I got 3 day weekends now
they need to be pushed and merged back into the master branch
theres now 2 branches with updates from a single point
why are we using the second to most updated map again
don't you regularly repost shitpost bot
kys
vro
at the same time last year
apparently we were in the same hotel
no-hit
more like
rohit
and hating drow
the only bonding is between two people who want to free evil gods
development
inter-character relationships
or on the boat
plus i think we can do more character development with non-combat situations in a town
seems dicey
but undead who cant heal vs cleric
because i think I'm reasonably safe with self heals and forms
that's fine
i mean if you want to risk people fighting a cleric
with a few helpers
and assassinate them
nah we train a bit
so does coming back with some assassins and taking out all the legates and praetors at once
were not strong enough to take care of those whod they would set on us
and leads to being hunted
and storywise just going and murdering her is dumb
also i think the game is more about story than combat
whos undead
clerics tend to know
wed take her down but at least one person would die
someones gonna die
but even if shes level 7+
it was 18
idk about that
and a high level dracolich
one high level cleric
its like fucking with the dracolich
i mean i don't think its smart
i mean i don't wanna murderhobo
if we go south I near guarantee I can convince allies
yea but if she dies they know were hunting them
we want to sweep the higher ups quickly
killing her early gives them warning to prepare
and kill the whole guild at once
or we could come back stronger with allies
by a high level cleric
or killed
and get arrested?
plus we could find a large city and look for allies
cause you don't worry about being murdered by the guild
and its more free
well theres more to explore in the south
by sea is also faster
what century is it
theres gunpoweder
pirates are free xp
by sea. were more likely to be stopped by the guild on foot
so lets take the boat
nah I can aquatic form now
I think were gonna meet unka there
where you at
team
human rogue
davaid
#metoo
no fuck you
I'm also going to school sunday tho
I can do tomorrow

mars where the fuck are you
and I do declare parsa is triple gay
I'm here
reeeeeeeeeeeee

reeee
campaign when
what the fuck did I just read
reeeeeeeeee
not till we get the next sesh
nope
wheres my fucking campaign
until I get around to finishing one of the better sketches
for now
its safer
id stick to the cleric

Peerless Skill
Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.
can I call a wood elf a stick chucker
or duregar
like deep gnomes
also do we have subspecies
or if we go to the desert we meet some browner folk
like black people from the dirt kingdom
do we have different nationalities and shit
grey-brown?
what color elves do we have
I didn't realize our campaign was so racially diverse
those are just mexicans
or green
are orcs brown in our world
and canines barely protruding upward
with more underbite
so like browner
go with the one that isn't cancer
oh
that's much better
someone just ask
you know theres an easy solution to this
lmao rip
what happened to unka
tell jett its at 4 so we start on time this time
I can get with that plan
whenever
I can do sunday but like today is lit

make sure jett doesn't keep us waiting again
oh and parsa
what about unka and the demon child
I can do today
I'm good at that time
its under character sheet but you have to highlight the gear in red
are you on the right subsheet
wtf
were retarded
Upon adding the Roll20 5th Edition OGL Character Sheet to a campaign, the 5th Edition SRD Compendium is automatically enabled for use as its own tab in the Sidebar of the application. It's located between the Journal and Jukebox tabs and is accessible for both GM and Player alike.

The Compendium allows for rapid searching of all rules, classes, monsters, spells, items, and more that are included in the 5th Edition SRD. This minimizes time spent for the gaming group to leaf through a book in the middle of a session for a rule clarification. Even better, both the GM and the Player can utilize dragging and dropping* from the Compendium tab directly to your character sheets. This makes statting NPCs and PCs far faster than inputing everything manually.
also this is a thing we didn't realize
its like in the rightmost column
also you can set your class/level there and have it auto modify other things
if you want roll20 to auto roll to hit AND damage in one macro you just set it in the back
I mean most of the important stuff is what people talked about on call
yea
yea so 4/6
he wasn't there
3/5 kappa

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
yea maybe but I was hoping itd be important enough to compel attention

But it's fucking compelling
It's not as magical as caenis
Anthony Ryan
Wow shocker 
Read it mars
10/10 book
No time for originality cause of mothers day
For the record if anyone's read blood song it's where I grabbed caenis
That was like 20 damage a round passively
Wait that bullshit dealt most of my damage
Remember to be ever vigilant of the Dark for it seeks to undermine the faith wherever it can
Get rekt pasta 
Even counting banish as dealing all its hp in damage I still think I won
mars you used to do that
and idk how to start call
im on my laptop
aight well lets do this week then we can look for more
yea but idk if kevin wants to be left alone with just markus
or recruit another
anyway do we want to keep going or wait till mars schedule is fixed
wtf
parsa
true that he didnt say much anyway
i guess whatevers best for him
didnt say anything to me tho so idk

for context mars playtested the game on that site
jose darkstaff aged 2000000
i saw your troll survey
also mars you cant break the game anymore
check it out
the skeleton of my site is up
oh actually since i feel like you guys are less likely to judge than my other friends
im gonna get blackout
cool. have a great time with your celebrations everyone
so lets just take a break another week and maybe find another player for when we're all good again
yea it seems like the holidays is a struggle for everyone
so any thoughts
im kinda stressed lol
idk
but idk if i can get out of this. we could take the time to find one more and get them up to speed?
i don't want to miss tho cause im not here next week either
lol my parents are setting up the yard and fire pit and all that
so I may be late
hmm apparently I have a family dinner tonight
im good unless theres some family event im not remembering rn
Yea we should discuss that too. We were expecting to be at 4 eventually from the start but idk if you guys want to look for more or just stay as is
So my gf has been here since finals ended and I have to drop her at the airport later. I think I have to bail this week cause I'm not ready. Sorry guys

my papers were good but holy shit I hated writing them
the big gay
is what we call
paper writing
everyone knows that
8-12 is the least productive time of day

leaked address
and all I ate was pie
we had 24 people at our house
my sisters friendsgiving was just jett and I flaming each other and making their preppie asses super uncomfortable
that's not the kind of attention that you should want

jeez still
was that at a family dinner or what
that way you don't have to eat super early

Idk
Shit sucks
Jett and my sister's bitch ass friends are all here
I wish I could play but I'm home until morning
League pelehands
Yea but my other Pokemon are like 50-60
Instead of like 10 up
I was out leveled this game
Dude they're pretty strong now
After I level him
I want to try to solo the elite 4 with him
And caught him
I was just chaining for a shiny charmander
I don't even like him
Perfect IV shiny given enough steroid to kill an elephant
It out stats a mewtwo 50 levels higher
Seems good man
I just want to share this
Are you guys free tomorrow. I am
Pork and chicken are low tier
Wtf. Beef and lobster
Only
Steak
I knew it<context suggestionId="da0cb6a9-a942-4226-9c50-be91b41f59f5" impressionGuid="4E203FD857FF4A5985D528D2CD9D1C19" serviceTag="3FF2AED2E69C453987E7424F1B42117E" clientId="0B818B6433F64F5B84893A5CF2EE6729" serviceTraceId="04F6DE4BFE4D4B80BAA987F0708FBF7E" suggestionType="Reply" providerId="cortana"></context>
And devour it
Let's ritually kill the worst tasting bird
so unless anyone objects ill get rid of the rest
ok i highlighted the ones you wanted in green
Yea.... Tell yourself that
And walked in
You saw the corral
You all did tho
And their barbarian with like 18 16 20 16 14 14 managed to die
They grouped together backs against a cliff
My favorite fight still has to be the Wolf pack with an alpha that did fire damage
What about flesh golems
or victor ironflex himself getting torn to pieces by a flaming wolf
was the dankest shit
i still think the stalking trees
and I think an ogre walked into camp at night
boar
also the giant board
with little phaselings
as well as a phase spider
do all of the above
or
S P I R E W O O D  T I M E
yea sure
Squirtle -&gt; squirter
I always name my pokemon really dumb names
ninetails ez
and you don't really have to be in game to discuss how to use party gold
the whole point of this was I didn't want to use game time to handle it
you ask the questions
because as the interviewER
normally you ask a specific person a question
you know when you interview someone
I have the power to banish him at will
he disappears
see as soon as mars has to do smth
MAAAAAAAAAAAARS
AND HAVE MARS TELL ME HIS GODDAMN CHOICES AND DEPLOYMENTS
and play eevee
my plan for the day is literally go home
platinum
etc
permadeath
no items
like never evolv
you just have to make the challenge yourself
but also pokemon games are always easy af
for maximum value
so im just gonna start with 6 perfect IV dragonites
you can also transfer pokemon in from go
bones are for dogs
exactly
also the best cuts are boneless anyway
why would you not just remove the bones if youre gonna eat a cut with bones in it
so at least youre half right
is never good
bone in meat
eggs are good so long as the yolk isn't solid
eating meat with bones in is gross
the egg thing
not the bones thing
what do you mean
&quot;Alive&quot;
they've already joined the vard so you know theyre not bumbling incompetents
what could you even want to ask
other 3?
so mars
so 1: the cleric
the specialist adventurers just take their cut from the mission loot
you only pay upkeep and hiring price on rank and file soldiers though
yea theres a section for upkeep in daily silver or monthly gold
If you can afford it
Also lmk if you plan on hiring more than just the twelve spears 
Pick four 
In all likelihood
Won't be six after next
Yea for the last time in a while
They both have guidance
Bless and guidance are different
So which 4
No
Just have to pick the adventures and determine which missions you're sending them on
I mean if you're all ok with mars being captain then it's settled 
Seeing as he's not really divine
Or at least a parasite monster
Nobody's taking the campsite right where a parasite God is rooted
You guys can also still discuss with the captain what to do they're just the face to the army and can edit the sheet
I guess essentially they passively advance the vards war effort and bring back loot, info, etc for you
Etc
And you were given 12 spearmen to start
Oh the other thing was there's 8 adventurers on there so you can pick the 4 you want under your company and the rest go to another
I haven't slept in over a day so my explaining is shot
If you look at the sheet it's clearer I think
And there's a Google sheet to track it
One person is captain and controls troops and a handful of adventures
I put a huge block earlier that tldrs to the party is promoted
No just fucking pick your shit
I don't have the brainpower to flame you
fuck you just do the heroes/troops shit
so I have to demo our game lol
I cant cause my partner isn't here
im dead tired. kill me
i made this tho to replace that janky old map
I didn't sleep like at all
gnight
cool
also figure out whos gonna be captain and which 4 you want
so just lmk any questions or comments or whatever
im probably explaining this real bad but im dead tired
and so with the combined heroes/troops you can assign them to missions
of which you can choose 4 and the rest will go to a different company
so I guess as an example barrack aenwyn is now command post aenwyn and you currently have 12 spearmen and 8 adventurers that wish to join
sheet should auto calculate troop upkeep
as well as bring back stuff or advance the vard's war effort
and as they complete missions if they survive they'll get stronger
you can buy troops with gold and give excess magic items to your heroes
as well as troops that can go with them but are just fairly standard soldiers
you can pick specialists which are full on adventurers that can take on missions
so 1 person will be the &quot;captain&quot; aka can edit the sheet with the groups decision
and because I don't want this to take like 2 hours next session im giving it now
So the day after the Battle for Enlurth, as youre all resting up, Elin comes to your barracks once more. &quot;My apologies for the display yesterday. The wound and the curse upon it addled my mind and I acted unfairly. In any case, our command has suffered losses and we will need capable officers more than ever. Decide among yourselves who is best fit to rise to the rank of Captain. You will still serve as you have, but will be responsible for the actions of those below you. Already, your deeds have spread and now a few who dream of greatness seek to be placed under your command. Notify me when your decision is made, and when you have decided which four are worthy to serve in your company.&quot;
etc
or like 77 base 8 is 7x8 + 7x1
like 0x27 or 27 hex is 2x16 + 7x1
transformation of bases is pretty simple
sure but irl youd only need like 12 int to figure it out
shes basically einstein
the wizard has 18 int
cause its a 16s column instead of 10s in second
16 becomes 10
10-15 is a-f
but 10 becomes a
1-9 is 1-9
hexadecimal base
yea mars got it
cause hes salty he cant shitpost like a real professional
parsas hard flaming my ass
cursed_drawing
buddy which one do you think
i was struck by the feeling of art
mars on an average night
i deadass cant draw shit unless im super inspired in the moment
and I mean literally
art is a feeling
also working on campaign is kinda something you just are in the mood for
why this change of heart
mars all you ever do is tell people to play some shitty indie fighter
rip
but guys don't get to wear accessories so
I think its a sick ring
did someone say d a r l I n g
public transport yikes

but you can see its output in the console tab
and the javascript is usually within the html
css on the right
html on the left
like go right click inspect element
except web design cause web designs cancer
you know them all
see the trick is once you learn one language
i just haven't implemented it
ive got this great plan
so a site for html, css, javascript, that holds my git projects in C, C#, c++, java, python, and download sites for games in unity
fair. i have to prove to companies i actually know the languages and software tho
i think you can host sites off git for free
and im actually kinda impressed
and then code a site
somehow organize the folders
my plan for winter break is pretty much download every project and clone it into a public one
i have literally nothing except private branches only i can access omegalul
but im way too lazy
and apply for shit
link my git repos
make a website
i have to upload my games and projects and stuff
I see. I feel on the industry people being more important than class tho
if you don't need the lecture you don't need it
that's fucking dumb lol
who does attendance in college
that's unfortunate. at least theyre reusable
were gonna start
well hopefully you get them off soon
you gotta teach her how to manage time early
its the mars special
he says dumb stuff that he never means
same
no
that shits tilting me off the face of the earth
parsa change your gd picture
get fucked
9 and 7
as soon as I tell him gj
parsa rolls 18 15 15 15
oh. ive been roasting him for getting hit lol
so we just kept memeing that hes a pussy and dumb for getting hit
he didn't go to school that one day cause he got hit by a car
yea we did
we roasted him for ages
how do you not remember this
so its still on my mind
I just got done roasting him for it through league
like jett
get hit by a car
no
so are you rerolling
e d g e
name a more fitting duo
you and grave cleric
im ok with that
I need to move to alaska
kms
lol the worst part was I went to sleep with my friend and she left before I woke so idk if she felt the sweat either
that sounds so much nicer
california, why
fucking gross
I literally woke up with my sheets soaked in sweat
also why did it suddenly get so fucking hot
retroactive conversations are valid ones
what else is there to buy
idk man
might as well get a hentai hoodie amirite
so I cant get that
I mean someone bought the other mistborn knife
youll see
just look up ahegao hoodies
and i cant have my family finding that shit in my closet
except id never wear it unless its a special meme occasion
i always wanted one of those hentai hoodies
support makes that hard
lol. i just want to win
get him out of my game
also cause that champ op as fuck
yea but i don't play support cause im not boring
and fuck rakan
except xayah's are 20cm which doesn't fit my wrist
i wanted riot's Xayah and rakan bracelets
midterm season ended so im not obligated to leave for like a month
nah. clothes are for people that go outside
im smelling a watch this year based on my parent's amazon history
itd be less bad if it was socks cause my closet is sparse af
so i always end up buying my own Christmas present
yea. i usually get normie stuff from my parents
but i want to this year
and ive yet to top it
i got myself the second knife in here one year
yea but ours is in a week
its not even thanksgiving and im already looking forward to Christmas tbh
weld lmao. my way is 3d print the mold since i have access to their lab
i don't have like woodworking tools or anything
the only stuff i can actually make has to be of metal
nah
i like collecting stuff made of weird materials
I just want to own some bones
except California disagrees
im sure they can spare a few bones
time
they dig up mammoths all the tim
I live real close to the la brea tar pits
you dig it up
yea that's why I wouldn't feel bad about using their ivory
I think theyre past the point of endangered
its mammoth ivory
fuck you California
and then I realized theres 4 states its illegal in, and somehow I live in one
so I wanted to get this mammoth ivory dice set for myself for Christmas
different
mars's will be
you can change up the eldritch blast based on patron tho
or they suck when everyone gets all their spells every day anyway
see either warlocks op since they get 1-5th spell slots each day while everyone else is struggling after day 1
its pretty rough
theyre doing you short rest on an night's sleep
monkaHMM
I just realized this stream is long rest on a week and short rest on a day
youll never take that away from me
fuck you i loved gemi
how dare you, gemi hard carried
well if you did
she literally said &quot;oh yea, ill go with you. I was bored here anyway&quot;
in her conversation with gemi
yea it was
the guards didn't follow you in with her
you were the first ones to go see her all week
she was just bored out of her mind
no they didn't lol
yea but she never saw you on it either
and only the guards ever saw you on it
you took the Jian
yea but
impress the....guards?
yea. it was funny
yea but it was funny
its like going out looking for dragons when youre just trying to deliver a package to the next town over
on top of it never really being required to fight
and it gave you the choice to back out
you were warned repeatedly that it was really powerful
on the other hand
you had so many chances not to
you chose to fight it
you were playing a fighter stfu
except youd never hit the 1/3 its hp requirement
because that makes way more sense
lmao so it was going to be immune to all magic
Divine magic is all about drawing your magic and learning your magic through a divine lens, whether that's Gods, nature spirits or nature itself. Some cosmic force usually that has consciousness that is bestowing power upon you or that you are tapping into.
also destiny abusing lily is so goddamn funny
yea but their magic is still divine
ignorant cuck
nature magic is divine
so do rangers
druids use divine magic
then he rolls another 18 anyway
and someone died while having a 20 in their primary stat
like 2 hours
destiny/lily is my favorite dynamic
rakshasa is the tiger demon
its pretty dank
with like toast/lily/destiny
are you guys watching the offlinetv dnd session rn
add some gay and drugs
minus the furry and its accurate to milos game
that cost me so many brain cells i forgot murdering people wasn't lawful or good
its dealing with the gay jokes and general downs for 5 of those hours
see its not the 8 hours that's the issue
in my defense, insanity is a valid claim after that
you know I lost so many brain cells that day
you made me kill an innocent man
fuck you, you made me look like an evil retard
and opportunity
given time
youll kill yourself
mars we don't have to kill you
good luck lol
anyway. Ill give a small prize to anyone that can figure out the words
because that doesn't account for the letters
also its not a shifting cipher
you two were surprisingly low
directly ciphered
N Q I C E I E N E L I N S A D A Q A S M Q I N H I E S E M I G H N
and I wouldn't give free letters
im pretty sure if you direct translate its gibberish
thatd be too easy
not directly though
kinda
its a word puzzle
if you can reverse engineer the puzzle itself somehow
the answer is T
but those aren't betting odds
that's true
omegaLUL
this is why I look up online puzzles
dashes
although a hint, the answer is one letter/number
cause I feel like its too time consuming
except im gonna leave it here and see how long it takes
the one I always wanted to use was:
14-17-9-3-5;   9-E;   5-14-5-12-E-9-14-19;   1-E-4;   1-C-17-1-19-13;   17-9-14-8-9-E;   5-19-5-13-9-7-8-14;
except milo solved it in 2 seconds
my first puzzle was &quot;which doesn't belong, 3 5 7 9 11&quot;
that would take way too long to solve
or numbers sequences
cause if it were up to me itd just be logic proofs
99% I have to look up
yea I suck at puzzle generation
lul
luckily I own a car
yea ik
so come
and I don't want to ask christina
also the number of people I can ask to go to the getty is pretty limited
you know the renaissance wasn't that long ago
so I guess next time I go ill take pictures lol
I go to the one by my school like twice a month
really? most natural history museums have a few don't they
no lets go look at nudes of historical rich people
wut
and I want to go look at them
or also the getty center has a collection of nude portraits from the renaissance
look at some motherfucking dinosaurs
you and milo are gonna come
the natural history museum is across the street from my school mars
one of these days im gonna make mars go look at dinosaurs with me
and I regret nothing
id go to great lengths to meme my friends just a bit
which honestly made the date kinda worth it even though I had to break into my own home and fit 2 on my couch
yea this girl he used to like is now the stripper for rocky
especially because I can hold it over milo
dank enough I guess
so like
but I got to see a high school friend naked
like I blew 50 on rocky horror last week
also im always down to drop some money for a good meme
yea
which I have like 100k of
or blue essence
I have it on pbe but not live
whenever hentai addict becomes available
also mars ill change the name
I just watch the meme anime of the year
so it just leads to really awkward conversations
and I don't know shit about hentai or anime
every other game someone talks to me about it
mars because its fucking hilarious
but eve got nerfed
and &quot;nine elevelynn&quot;
before that it was &quot;fakku Friday&quot;
but Id get reported like 3 times a week
it used to be &quot;loli futa trap&quot;
I mean mine is &quot;jinx yuri hentai&quot;
kms
ahahah
which is my boat
lmao a friend of mine got banned on league for the name &quot;tight vi janna&quot; and then again for &quot;choke me daddy uwu&quot; and is now honor 1-3 so they aren't getting season rewards
so im good just doing a chill 30-40 hours a week programming from home
idk. all that matters to me is having stability
but its not great on average
nah you do ok
so I realized they were right about bio being not the best career path
its more like I just kinda think really long term though
Lol kinda
No idk I just roll with whatever
I just do what's expected of me
I don't have dreams
except my parents wouldn't let me bio major or anything
shit ive always wanted to work in an aquarium
and its by far the best
black flag was sick. its more of a pirate game than an AC
black flag &gt; else
sounds nice
its at least 10
not 5
and its all better
but then you make better ones
i hate these people
you get out of high school and then realize
ugh
drew
mina
fuckin shannen
were awful
cause half of the friends i had
you may be lucky
theyre the people you accidentally know and sometimes bang or go do stuff with
just the weird kind
our friends still are nerd
youd have loved it
i still cant believe you didn't come to the bonfire with us in 10th
so its just frustrated and bored adolescent boys
everyones pissed they have to be there and theres no girls
so we'd have like 200 scouts in the woods with all of staff drunk or high
except from the older kids
and so there was like no supervision
we had 10x the usual amount of kids
yea our troop was just extra crazy
so i couldnt
unfortunately i was sent to boy scouts
i also like to avoid stabbings
in 5 years
there was only like 3 stabbings
wed just pull knives and threaten
well youre not actually trying to stab people usually
scouts fights were constant, brutal, and over the pettiest shit
scouts was fucking dumb
literally broke the blade out of a flip blade and ran a rope through the hole meant for the screw
i made a knife whip one camp
a minute in and everyones got their knives out
like 30s in and people are using branches
but that shit gets way outta hand way too quick
ive fought my friends at scouts too
so?
so they weren't really fights
my sister is younger
except
lmao i only ever did like full on fights
ive definitely boxed my sister
have you not fought your siblings
as long as its with your friends and not for real
its deadass kinda fun
which is pretty much being drunk
yea ive never been in a fight that wasn't drunk or at scouts
i guess but when else are you gonna fight
with the sound of a fistfight going on further down in the dark
and puking in an alley
all my most vivid memories of drinking are like it being 3am
and sooner or later crazy shit goes down
see the trick is just have your friends and encourage each others bad ideas
for it to be during
i get drunk too fast
no matter what its entertaining
or get arrested
or you get into a fight or smth
no you get laid after you drink
or do you drink for what comes after
do you actually drink for fun
I need to make harder riddles
milo did too
ayy gz
its cool do it rn
yea
yea
yea no im totally only in it for the girls
musically its pretty boring
idk im pretty sure 90% of the reason I like the kpop song is the visuals
and not even considered skinny by Asian standards
when the kpop dancers and singers behind them are skinnier
and believe it or not people flamed the cgi models for being too skinny and unrealistic
so this was the opening ceremony for the song live right
the standard stuff. metallica, iron maiden, etc
yea that's not the kind of metal I like lol
so I listen to it pretty rarely
no cause again music with voices gives me a headache
I just don't deal well with voices in music
pretty much always
but this is better
I mean I like metal so it was aight
also thicc
vi
thresh
diana
but all the champ logins are and those are actually good
and if you mean in house music jinx's wasnt
like all their music is
those were literally riot hired
those pentakill albums
wrong
and im gonna buy all the k/da skins
that shit fire
you guys see riots new kpop single
its intuitive. youll eventually recognize shape to side count
experience
So can start 8 for sure just gotta leave at 1115
Ok nvm about clash apparently it's beta one day only this time
And we won clash yesterday so if we win first 2 today we have a third and yesterday we barely ended 8. Small chance that the game 3 happens and we have to start 845ish. Sorry guys
Uh so it turns out I have to take that girl after all so I gotta go 1115
I'll pm you
There's more quotes 
It's also not as inspirational or emotional
I love the parts where stuff happens and suffer the rest
Theres more killed kings in the Stormlight prologue than two kingkiller books
But as it is writing doesn't make up for how slow paced it is at times
Yea idk of the story was better and more exciting I'd say it's better
As much as a fictional biography
But I think that takes away from it. The writing is great but it's not &quot;fantasy&quot;
Technically
It is
Kingkiller feels almost like an autobiography 
People
Stories about events, not purple
I like stories where stuff happens
And it just hops between present and past
Not enough happens
I don't care about kvothes specific semester or whatever
Main story needs to move
I'm hard opposite
I thought it was fine. Maybe even slow
And the world building is better
It's faster paced
In any case I still think Stormlight is better because the story is just better
What
For sure
You can
Style you can get from fiction or classic literature
Fair. I think story &gt; style tho
Shows he's capable but stylistically chooses not to 
And speaking of prose the whole chapter in OB &quot;the girl who looked down&quot;
Do you like that more than world and character building though
The characters aren't as good imo
I don't think kingkiller is written better
Of the decade
Imo. Stormlight best series
It's gotta be edgy
If Parsa likes it
Hype
Also worlds in an hour 
That shit edge
You nerd
Stop trying to get people into warhammer
What are you reading?<context suggestionId="2c0329d9-81de-4034-ace1-b048c1f222e8" impressionGuid="1FF379FFE21144BBB5BB10FE992E74EE" serviceTag="06762D7E52814A24A5DA1F3B21E7C355" clientId="8656C26AB3C4473BA1298129A708DC38" serviceTraceId="24D0A04B746F4564B693C62F52648C61" suggestionType="Reply" providerId="cortana"></context>
I see. I'm the opposite since I don't have to move my eyes to read on my phone
I also have pdfs if you want the dnd books free
I scrape barely 600wpm on paper but close to 900 digitally
Digital all the way lol
Also only heretics read physical books
All 10/10 fantasy
Stormlight, mistborn, malazan, ravens shadow trilogy (especially blood song), I liked eragon but objectively it's uhh, kingkiller chronicles, and the magicians
thanks
and like the range
Edited previous message: <e_m ts="1541196965" ts_ms="1541196966371" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
lmk
say so
also if anyone has darkvision
theres clash but it starts 6 so unless we end up winning tonight and getting into finals tomorrow 2 games shouldn't push past 8
yea probably
I'll fucking gut you
MARS
yea cause everyones all &quot;i gotta go make a name for myself and be my own person&quot;
three generations one roof is a common saying
when they have kids they can continue working because their parents take care of the kid
yea i think it works really well
like people live with their parents after college usually
its not a goal in asia
cause being independent and free just isn't a real thing
yea but you can see the culture difference in that you never hear a Taiwanese kid say theyre excited for college because they'll be independent and party and be free
basically the five relationships
as opposed to focusing on duty and responsibility
i was talking more about how western culture focuses on celebrating the individual and personal pursuit of happiness
individualism vs community
and not stability
it can probably be linked to the whole belief that you should pursue happiness
except for a few years where mom was getting tenure and stressed all the time
idk how to classify my parents but they were both awesome
my real beliefs are in numbers
ok mars how much of it do you think i believe tho
and im not wearing anime shirts to class
im not a 20 year old virgin
im reasonably well adjusted for a cs major
and put others first
you get to teach your kids how to compromise
i think that's the point of it
idk. i think that i grew up much more well adjusted because my parents were stable and married
marriage gives them an example of a healthy relationship to model themselves after ideally
than in asia
but theres definitely more parents in America that put themselves and their happiness over their kids
well ok then i guess he shouldn't stay in it
you should stay in their lives
so even if you split
i think that once you have kids you owe them everything you can possibly do to make their lives better
statistics show that two parent homes have more successful kids though
ok but even if you hate your spouse you owe it to your kids to stay together
since its social suicide
and wont get divorced
because unhappy people work it out
like the divorce rate and single parent homes in asia are so much lower
society should teach people that they have to make sacrifices for the greater good and that its ok to be unhappy if it means improving the future for others, especially your children
society shouldn't teach people that they come first
which leads to people leaving their spouse and kids
that being happy is more important than anything else
also i feel like the whole reason for gang violence is the belief that people should care for themselves first and be independent
it doesn't cost much to keep it going
so what if trains are running without people. the metro is electric and driverless
i don't think anywhere in America is that consistent
that almost never miss
well yea but both places have between 2 and 5 minute intervals on trains
if it weren't for the populace
completely implementable in america
this is taipeis
that's their subway in beijing
this is chinas high speed rail
theres no reason America cant
china even has a high speed rail across the country
and its certainly bigger than any US city
Beijing has the same subway system Taipei does
LA isn't bigger than taipei
by public transport
and be anywhere in LA you want to be
then take the bus for 50c
mars imagine you can take the train that arrives every 2 minutes to almost anywhere in the city for less than a dollar
its so nice
trust me
no 2 minutes
or have to stand often
and people don't push and shove
nah it works so that the trains aren't ever super crowded
that's pretty fucked that you even have to say that though
because theres no &quot;us vs them&quot; since everyone is so interconnected
and makes for a more civil society
which in turn decrease crime rates
gives a realer sense of community and country
or across the country in 2
so people can be anywhere in the city within the hour
and trains arrive precisely every 2 minutes
so you can actually use your downtown as a public transport hub
it also works better when you don't have specific ghettos with insane crime rates
turns out capitalism works
its way nicer now though
Taiwan did suck
its definitely better than where my parents were from
idk i think America is pretty great
its racist against Asians and whites
it is racism
and not be accused of racism
its just a way for schools to look diverse
the scores are so heavily skewed
lol
problem is in that case all the top schools would be Asian with a few whites
yea they should just get the numbers
at the end of the day theyre less qualified
i mean but who cares what the reason is
but based on those they assume your race
just name and zip code
not race
perfect score vs pretty far from perfect
aka an Asian kid with a 1600 is the same as a black kid with a 1400
but that was on the old SAT so squish the points by 2/3
its smth like whites need normal scores, Asians need like 50 points higher, Mexicans can get away with 50 points lower and blacks can do up to 150 points lower for the same results
they do in engineering
means we're getting dicked with a bunch of admissions that aren't deserved
the fact that I have a speech prepared to break the news to kids that theyre not the smartest in the class and not even the smartest in the office hours room
we're literally getting shafted with a bunch of incompetents because the dean doesn't want our major to look like its Asians and Indians only
its not a race thing its just facts
stfu
i mean i can see their scores
and i think most of the white kids are affirmative action
no ik its just cause my major is litearally all Asian or white
there'd probably be a lower fail rate
so if the other's spot had gone to one to begin with
its almost never the Asian kids
drop
but so many of the non Asian kids are the ones that struggle in CS and the ones that dro
like this is going to sound super racist but i don't mean it in a racist way
and so society as a whole loses because the more talented one isn't getting as good an education
cause their spot goes to someone less qualified
it also keeps a lot of truly talented people out of top schools
that being born Asian means you have to try harder
i mean i just think its unfair
mars you know that it helps you tho
but that's secondary
also fucking me on entrance exams
single handedly decreasing the percentage of bangable girls from 45% to 10%
fuck you affirmative action
instead of just like 20%
if affirmative action weren't a thing thered be like 90% Asians here
so its double fucking me
meaning less Asian girls
and also cause theres less Asians here
it makes my life harder cause I both have to score better
just makes my life that much harder
cause why the fuck is it a thing
but then again if it were up to me affirmative action wouldn't be a thing for uni either
a portfolio you can somewhat control since theyd have a name on it
are the stuff you can control
like monitored exams and gpas and shit
essay doesn't mean shit because theres no proof you wrote it
i feel like acceptance should be based on your portfolio
lol shit im just here for the degree
since theres like 16k people each year that apply with perfect scores
your score is pretty non-competitive at like 1500 tho
max score on sat is 1600
probably the best candidate actually
a lot of people just say &quot;low chance&quot; or &quot;no chance&quot;
cause i can crush their spirits
those are the kids i love seeing in my office hours
and its like bro, calm yourself
like they'll brag in their post about being valedictorian or whatever
but turns out a tiny Midwest school doesn't mean shit
like again, theyre all top of their school so they think they'll be top of the class and breeze through
kids who overestimate themselves
or &quot;what are my odds with a 2.7 and a 1400, usc is my dream school&quot;
nah theres also like &quot;can I double major CS and pre-med&quot;
school wouldn't weight it
lul
my gpa was uh 3.7
yea but like they just ask dumb shit like &quot;Can I get into engineering with my 2.9&quot;
i use it to register the easy GEs
for parties or like knowing which classes to take
that think theyre smart
and half of them are dumbass Midwest kids with like a 4.0 but a 30 ACT or smth
every year its full of &quot;can i get in with x gpa and y SAT scores&quot;
is fucking great
the usc subreddit during app season
you know how rn is college app season
the worse they are at their major
but like the more yikes the kid looks
and then the Asians are always the ones just breezing
are always the ones doing ok
while the normal looking kinda fit ones who could pass for a normal major kid
are always the ones struggling like a motherfucker
like the super nerdy ass cs kids who smell like shit and have the worst faces
why are the yikes kids always the dumb ones
also
are a major yikes
dude the people desperate enough to go to professor office hours
but idk if its relatable
i have a meme
wait have you guys ever gone to a professors office hours
see that's when you just fail them
and just be conveniently sick on midterm week
the best way to survive office hours is get some boba and the nice headset
no then they come in and interrupt my chill session
im honestly getting a sign that says &quot;Do not enter unless your code compiles and runs&quot;
that's how i feel whenever someone comes in and first thing they say &quot;my code doesn't compile&quot;
if you need office hours youre a talentless hack
these are the kids that come into office hours
also
for engineers
because why the fuck are essays a thing
i can write a thousand lines of code in less time than a page of an essay
me too
paper done
boom
A -&gt; B, B-&gt;C, A-&gt;C
yea but why though
i always feel like im reiterating
my point is usually made in like a page and a half
dude that shits hard
busy
im
ok
i need you to understand i have like 3 hours of class a week
and don't want to play some new indie bs
mars you cant sell it to us cause were busy as shit
so you aren't begging companies for a job
luckily my field is way understaffed
eh im picky. i was gonna apply google and facebook but they do sketchy shit
and i can take the L on cash
tbf tho i want to intern at a game company anyway
yea basically
so...
except she tries way harder
shes also maybe the only person as talented as I am
ive mentioned her
and has a lot of hot friends
is gay
shes from taiwan
the gay one
ive talked about her
dude shes my cousin
minus whatever food and rent costs in seattle
shes legit getting smth like 40k over two months
im actually so pissed Kelly got a Microsoft internship
let me get back to you in 2 days
like shit you wanted 3 lights and 5 objects
is a bitch
yea the reason why is cause ray tracing with more than 2 lights
and google isn't even looking for specialized interns
dude google pays interns 15k a month + rent which is another 7k
and I am gonna be so goddamn harsh
but hey at least i get to judge other people's implementations next year
cancer assignment
using various methods of subdividing the scenes and lights to avoid redundant calculation
that are a close approximation
but theres a few theories and implementations of &quot;faster&quot; ways to do it
so for Pixar and them its a few days to render a scene
however that takes like 1000x the time
but that's not as realistic as firing light beams from light sources to each object then calculating their path around the room until they hit the camera
basically the way light tends to work now in a game is it back traces a beam from camera to object then to light sources to see which are affecting each pixel
and movies
video games
since 70 is an A
so i can kinda dick this assignment
on the bright side i still have 100 in the class
aka kill me i don't want to implement ray tracing
this paper is our &quot;intro to the next assignment&quot;
this is how you derive the formulas for splines
no this is for the roller coaster assignment
for him to get it wrong
i don't need to tell him the wrong thing
these are the lecture slides
theres no way he doesnt
like I fucking struggled
that course is a fuckin nightmare
and itll be funny
i mean im gonna
which logically makes more sense as my topic
but the statement about perfection was related to programming
you ape
it was implied
no i said programming is like magic
its basically like magic, it requires tons of study, most people find it too difficult to be worth learning, a little mistake throws everything off, and youll never be shit compared to people with real talent anyway
the human mind is accustomed to &quot;good enough&quot;, its not wired for perfection
nobody does everything right
dude its a programming course
gonna fail his dumb ass SO HARD
im hyped
dude i get to TA my roommates class next semester
or outside
no reason to go to the gym
like if i did the challenge id basically be a troll this month
idk i mean whats the point
im not dumb enough to take challenges i cant win
im not doing that shit
so hes got the easiest time doing the challenge
see that's not fair cause nobody wants parsa to begin with
didn't you challenge miles or smth
mars are you doing nnn
i wish we had a festival that sounds so funny
when in reality they just don't have the talent
that all claim &quot;their talents were wasted there&quot;
business school is half CS rejects
theyre the ones most deserving of it
nah i just flame the people that drop out of my major
id flame art majors but i almost was one
its so fun to watch
their soul breaks and their world shatters
then when it dawns on them theyre just middle to bottom of the barrel
its always funny seeing that shock though. like they were all top of their school and always smartest in the room
they just weren't good enough
like theyre all top 1% of students in the country
like in all honesty most of the people that dropped or i failed weren't dumb
&quot;try not to cry, and if you break, leave the class. thanks&quot;
lol that's sounds alien af to me. our lectures are &quot;i hope you have natural intuition and talent or you wont understand shit&quot;
gotta filter the idiots you know
one section
our sophomore classes are about 40 people
our freshman classes start like 200 people and 2 sectiosn
after midterm 2 we were down to 60
i loved it
by the lecture after midterm 1 the class was half empty
about 50 people never picked it up
yea I graded the first midterm with a 40% average or smth
ended like 47
i think the one I TA'd it started 150 people
its like 50% fail rate on a good semester
I TA'd a filter class
cause they assumed id stay overtime just to finish their hw
made like 8 freshmen cry
10/10
cause youre not a public school teacher and if they pass or fail it doesn't matter
but also you can tell people to fuck off as a TA
I don't think anyone really liked me as a TA
&quot;oh youre crying cause you'll fail if I don't help you? sorry bruh my hours are up and i gotta play some league.&quot;
like &quot;oh youre panicking cause a huge assignment is due 2 days and youre stuck here. Read textbook chapter 12-1 through 13-3 youll find the answer somewhere&quot;
and when they are there you aren't obligated to help them beyond small hints and pointers
so you basically get paid to reddit
nobody shows up unless midterms or hw is due
its so easy you just chill at the lab
I TA'd a course
its economically way more efficient to hire TAS
which is like 10-15 hours of professors time
400 a week x 3 TAs is 1200 a week
they get like 20 hours a week at 20 bucks an hour
TA's are way cheaper than professors
its just &quot;go talk to the TA
lmao half my professors wont even hold office hours without appointment
i wouldn't know. the only ones im &quot;close&quot; with were the ones whos labs i worked in
i cant imagine being legit friendly with one
damn. i know like 2 professors names and ive never spoken to one outside of class
does art school do tenure
wait was he not tenured
tenured ones are set tho
teaching track professors are fucked
pay depends on what track professor tho
i should reconsider my career path
turns out its actually just a pretty sick gig overall
and basically unable to be fired
also only working 2 days a week on campus is nice
so assuming annie gets in too its like a 400k signing bonus
&quot;hey come here we have more money AND if your kids get in they get free tuition&quot;
basically
they sniped a bunch of people from her old company with it
yea my mom literally only took the job because of the tuition benefit
so...
but 80% of professor's kids get in
ye. i think its about 20% of faculty kids get in and get free tuition
its the 900iq play
cause they never get in
so they don't have to pay for like the cleaning staff's kids
the perk applies to all faculty so you have to get in without mentioning your parent
i just don't pay cause she works
technically I go cause I got in
cmonbruh
and I go to school
I don't legally own a car
and he doesn't have to pay it back
dude its like 6-7k a semester
wheres my 7k huh trump
which is bullshit
he doesn't need a job he has that government money
or was that jerry and milo
weren't you and milo gonna move in at some point
you live with your family but pay rent?
parsa and mars you two just hate it cause youre trash
so clash is this weekend
same
uh
but idk if hes counting them in his 3 famous people
mars apparently saw lilypichu and offlinetv
I met gabe from the office on a hike
but ive bumped at least 15 lcs players
the ones I like are mostly e-famous
or youre blind as hell
so either you just don't like 99% of actors
Arnold S goes trick or treating on montana
we live next to Hollywood and you've only met 3 famous people?
on day 1
this is how mars lost no nut november
get on call and ill explain
hmm ok. I did get out of going to the date on the bright side so we don't have to rush
aight. np
yea I kinda just told her I feel sick cause I was at the doctor anyway this morning and took a picture
parsa its called letting them down easy
so it doesn't look like an excuse
and sat say im still sick
I could just say Friday im sick
yea maybe
yea that's not gonna work cause I have to see her sunday too
lifes hard dude
at this point though I either go or I fake an injury or smth
I mean its not a bad plan but like its pretty bad
Lol I tried
But I haven't come up with a good excuse yet
Same. I got roped into it and don't want to go at all
lol I meant saturday
guys I have a date 11pm so either were gonna go a little shorter than last time or we can start early. lmk which you prefer
disguise is int
32 minutes and 4 here already lol
mostly skype tho
theres background music on roll20
i just run a Linux shell on it now
and I hate ios
yea same. also my laptop is apple
but at least I get to be on my pc instead of at home on laptop
I don't have a camera on my computer
i just wish it was billable lol. could've made 1600 if it was for a client and not a class
and its documentation is awful
its just that normally its all abstracted beneath some other software cause its really low level stuff. like straight on the gpu calls
that was kind of an exaggeration im pretty sure its still updated and used by windows
count so far is 30 hours and 500mb into this assignment
its awful. same class i had to do the pixel data to heighmap converter for
this shit is so awful nobody has updated it since like the html days lol
id rather be at the dmv
mars ive been programming catmull-rom splines all day
im pretty out of it
idk ive been doing this shitty assignment all day
26 hours and 34 minutes
we've been over this hyperBruh
gdi
did you call the group mars
mars
im still in lecture so I cant really do much
if you need help mars and parsa are good with r20
done
ill get you one rq
oh shit
yea either on the front of your character sheet or in the bio tab
with a lot of room for discussion and getting to know each other and how they do things
my plan was jump right into it. get a mission from captain arnor and see it done
should be fine. 8pm pst sat. mark the time
so I might be slow to take turns since I cant have 5 sheets open across a tiny screen and stuff
instead of my nice ass headset and pc
ideally this week. im gonna be at home and not my apartment though so im stuck on my laptop with apple earbud mic
thanks
or league chat lol
I do but I mostly use skype
I don't mind
changeling is an actual race
i swear you told me sorc
or sorc
wait you said wizard
mars is sorcerer
yea he hadn't said anything
yea who was that
i just don't want to do it with a glitchy mouse
its fine. its just d4 series
since my mouse broke and i cant complete my series
i main aram as of the last 2 days
so its doubly awful
it also keeps mars from playing league with us
its a bad video game
get out
absolver sucks
oh
ive been working on the background knowledge sheet
i didnt
and are they not made of solid stone
do your books not weigh 5lbs
and itll annoy you when youre over
you just put in weights for items in the inventory
the sheet calculates it automatically
yea
yea go for it
mars?
idk what the tutorial is so im gonna assume yes
ill allow it if anyone needs to get like a +2 in their main stat lol
is your main stat under a 14
and handouts
if you go to the tabs at the top one should have the character sheet
and in the right hand side is the chat
yea you launch the game
i don't see you in it. do you see the campaign map in the background
are you on the roll20 page
or just copy paste the text into feats and abilities
i believe you can drag in stuff from the compendium for the most part
mars and parsa are the ones who are good at it
and then for character sheets im not as good cause i make npc sheets
to roll 4d6 and drop lowest automatically
or /roll4d6d1
you can macro stuff like /rollXdY
roll20 is probably easier
also everyone can modify and see the handout for stuff to be remembered yea
just lmk
or anything
also if anyone has questions about the backstory
yes
for all
no just 4d6 drop 1
what can i do
Christie wont text me back
but hey
like a 6
3 for 3 so far
and you know me i always get stuck with an Asian girl that's weirdly into me
we have a project together
some girl
i had to book my ass back to my computer to give you your sheets lol
mars I wasn't even eating I was at christinas place and didn't see the chat going on
also if you guys are rolling stats were doing 4d6 drop 1
already
on the page
you graffitied
mars that title
Cleric, here
Hey
Fucking bitches
And I mean more like with the random dropping out our schedule conflicts or whatever the fuck
Stfu edgeboi
Idk. You fucks make everything so difficult
Tbh I was just gonna do that fast through text or a short call then do a real session another time
They're not a part of the throne room stuff
Nah. It's just you two trying to get out of a room anyway
Was that ever the plan
You know what tho. It sucks only hearing about problems when it grows and not when it starts 
I mean. Nothing to do there then
Aight then
Ik everyone died but still
Tbh tho like full resetting was aids
Understandable. I'm not opposed to cameras on but I think last time it came up someone was
Because the worst thing for me is when people aren't into it and it just feels like my fault. And I've been feeling it for a long time now so maybe it's better overall
And idk about you guys but I'm down to look for a few people online and see if it's actually a better fit rp wise
Idk. We had multiple people just regurgitate memes. Shit happens man
Jett just said neutral
You know it was Milo that said he's done and not jett
Tbh tho Milo you kind of just say meme stuff in character and not offer opinions or lead. Even as gemi. I can't imagine it's fun getting dragged for the ride
I mean I feel that. It just feels like you two are just waiting for turns and not getting into the world. So rip. Sorry guys
It's very likely short 
Friday or Sunday
whatever
i don't really want to work more on them
yea
yea turns out I don't like them as much as I did when I was drawing
hes not supposed to. I just didn't realize I was drawing with pen and not pencil
you know I realize now how edgy anariel looks
lul
Sharah/Seldanna/Lady Rinasel
Lord Hiskull Risthart
Prince Anariel. Its been a while but we finally get new custom art
The east and west are velenel too. The question mark is the three unaligned ducheys. Risthart, Tabir, and borlion. Too powerful to be forced into servitude but small enough to not be a princedom
the red dot in there for falconrest
currently youre in ALE for aleese
borders and capitols
as a peace offering
and kill the changling
hire a changling to admit he did it
yea but then you blame oozes
Or murder her, hide the body, and live as her for as long as you have spell slots each day and hide away the rest
so tldr impersonating Yvonne led to being part of some grand game
Anariel definitely wants something
so the political ramification of someone just giving up an oathblade is like someone giving up a billion-dollar company in terms of power
Average height, large ruby signet ring
Anariel is a young, probably 16 year old guy with a set of enamel-white dawnplate and attractive features. much more slender than most soldiers, and a leathery white cloak that seems to have veins running through it.
Summary of what you missed - crown prince Anariel relinquished the oathblade Starwrath to Prince Aleese, in exchange for &quot;a talk&quot; with him, and the lady Yvonne as well.
I even texted him and shit
yea probably
and stops being a cuck
unless he gets back soon
nah hes on his comp
and we'll see if hes here by 630
well I guess ill just eat rn then
its just mars that is away
milo looks like hes on skype
well whos here
we can start like 15 minutes later mars if you need it
well get your food before this time
worth
like in all honesty for the hippie memes about whole foods, at least their stuff is good
ralphs food is shit. haven't shopped there in 10+ years without feeling like the quality is waaaaaaaaaaay below other places
gtfo normie
ralphs is just whole foods for normies
one for mars
now taking bets for who whole foods us this time
aight
any times sunday that you guys are busy
sunday then
Friday-sun at some time
You just get extra salty
Can literally solo the tarassque
Confirmed by the devs that you can start a rage while raging. Meaning a level 20 zealot is basically unkillable unless you knock them out
youre all broke now!
SURPRISE
No
So like 98 silver is back to a gold 
Round your coins to the nearest whole 
Nah youre all poor now
Kms 
10 silver to a gold 
10 copper to a silver
Guys. I'm retarded. 5e is 10:1 for all coins
get on call
3238106949
everyone else is on
wtf
yea mars
now
whole foods just means late
Or taco bell or whatever it was
No whole foods when we start this time?
Well I'm on the way back. 10 min. Anyone else ready?
determines is parsa is whole foods
Edited previous message: determines if parsa is whole foods<e_m ts="1529276300" ts_ms="1529276300921" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
mars when tf you gonna be back
gay
of eating like a proper lady
that's the oppoosite
You're all disgusting
You're disgusting
And cause I don't want another hard int I'll say your characters are wise enough to know they can't take an army head on
And I guess it's better to be familiar already but you could say you're just together for the bounty if you can't think of any other reason
The farm itself is actually a small town with a lot of fertile farm around it. The most fertile in the princedom actually. Rumor is that the mayor, Sharah, has to do with it but villagers are pretty tight lipped about why. Some claim they've seen plows that work themselves and fields that sprout in a day. Regardless, it's a place Aleese definitely cannot lose
Which is also dependent on what remains
Anyway there's also gold in it if you stall the Raiders until help comes
Nah. He said there'd be too much conflict with him. Which is fair
Well since everyone made new pcs. The new call is that holder's farm is under siege by Varlen raiders and the Prince has put a bounty of 10% of what value is saved on it. 
Cuck 
Or I'll find your whole foods ass
So let's not say 4-10. Let's narrow it down
Same dude
That's my ideal time but even if we start later I can stay up since no work
Monday. Sunday I have nothing
I'm busy at noon till 1 but not after
Aight
And fuck yea I wanna see incredibles. When is that
I have the stuff planned I just have to put it together in the morning 
Well I can do Sunday evening
Go to sleep
Anyway. Milo and jett are you guys good for Monday night
B e g o n e t h o t
I don't get it either. They actually full on own the house too
She's like twenty years younger
But they're getting divorced so he's going back I guess
It's weird. The other house is nice af. Right on the coast
Yea. The guy currently renting actually has a house in the palisades but his wife wanted to live in a city so he's renting here
The tiny house we have by the airport goes for 5.5k a month. Fuck paying that kind of rent
Probably more with my house
Lol yea. 80k straight to pocket is like 150k you have to pay rent and food with
Lol. I'm planning on staying at home a few years after graduating tho. Pocket all that CS money
I don't need the money
Fuck work. Idk why I bother with this shit
Well 4 but getting home and shit
Lol same. I only work until 5 tho
For the week. As far as I know I'm not doing anything this week
So what's you jett and Milos schedules like
So I guess Parsa said he can do any time
If you could get away at 7/8 we could do it. Otherwise maybe during the week?
You cuck 
I wish I was. I gotta fly 18 hours tomorrow morning
Also my battery is dying. Fuck
Well what I was gonna ask is if anyone wanted to play Sunday evening or during the week
Who tf plays ranked in this shit meta AFTER hitting d5
So I'm back sat night but I actually have the whole week off cause I start work the 25th
Because you don't know shit going on in the world
And anything new or kind of nice deserves all the grand praise possible
You have to think like someone who's never gone more than 100 miles from where they were born
Until you get to something that's to shit to pretend. Then you do the kvothe and just say it happened and move on 
Mars everything sucks so just write as if you're someone pretending everything doesn't suck
Yea. Idk why they can't resolve it
Yea. That should be enough to write your story
Baronet is the lowest inherited title. Like rulership of a village or two 
I need to look. Also archduke is just a duke with royal blood
I put his name on roll20 I think. Idk where
Like all of the princedoms
Aleese is the last name
Also idk if you guys know how the nobility titles rank so here it goes. Royalty (king queen prince), Prince (not royal but owns a princedom), duke, marquess, earl, viscount, baron, baronet, knight
Although they're probably equally readable
At least it's not screenshots again
That's fucking gay. But whatever. Backstory woo. I'm getting off the train so this is what I've got for now
Why does Skype treat html tags as plain text
Aleese - northeast corner, east of Mirror Lake. Capitol in Falconrest, known for high number of troops fielded and lost yearly. Owns a single set of dawnplate that he wields personally, and is famously invested in acquiring a blade to go with it. One of the smaller princedoms, only overseeing two baronys and little wealth. The exception being that the city of Falconrest sits upon the abandoned Faolin, from which it draws its name and the impressive infrastructure of the inner city.&lt;div&gt;Bralien - north and west of Mirror Lake. Capitol in Redrise. Mostly in the Spirewood. Prince Eldrich Bralien owns two full sets of plate and blade, though he has aged past their use. One set is in the possession of his son, the Archduke of Tamire through his mother's royal blood. The other is in the hands of his Battlelord, a Viscount in his own right. The Duke of Yeldin owes loyalty to Bralien, as well as two infamous oathblades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Merelth - south of Mirror lake. Capitol of Corandor. &quot;Prince of daggers&quot; Kethan Merelth is a known double crosser, always seeking to increase his impressive but secretive collection of relics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Serthan - north of Sunfire Mountains, in the southernmost alkathar. Capitol in Waterlast. Known as the Mountain's Resolve, Valim Serthan famously held the Dead Man's Pass alone in his plate and mace against two thousand desert tribesmen. For this, he was granted two sets of plate and blade to match, which now reside with his eldest son and daughter. Though many have dueled the Desert Lotus, she has claimed their relics without fail each time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alvath(H) - the eastern coast of alkathar north of the Evergreen Range. Known for wine exports. The richest princedom, as well as one of three owning five or more sets of dawnplate and oathblades. Houses the Justicar's base of operations in ammnadel. Capitol in Amnenfall, a city once inhabited by Aasimar. Few of their blood remain, though the line of Alvath is among them. Many would say house Alvath would rule, if only the winged Lord of Amnenfall desired the throne. Tirael Alvath and his sons, Sahciel and Remiel are largely removed from the game of nobles, if only because few dare to lay challenge before them. The Alvath collection of plate and blade is great enough that many Alvath earls possess their own sets. And famously, the blade, Tamerlin, rests at Tiraels hip. At the impressive age of 130, Tirael has begun to show signs of age and Sachiel may soon rule Amnenfall. But while Tiraels ambition is lacking, Sachiel is legendary in both ambition and strength of arm. It is the secret hope of all other houses that his wife, the sorceress Aelina Crendowyl can reign the Dragon-who-walks. If not, soon the kingdom may bow before a new king.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alkathar(H) - south of Alvath and the Evergreen Range. The royal line of the kingdom. Capitol in Elrondel. Angular and graceful features mark the Royal line, as well as a talent for the arcane unmatched by other highborn. Many who have challenged the Royal line have quickly discovered that their lithe and elegant builds hide devastating strength and speed. The House of alkathar is a candle that burns bright and quick, princes becoming kings often by their twentieth year. The kingdom famously fields the most knights and battle mages of any other, a fact that let them conquer the others to begin with. By it's border with Alvath, the princedom rules the city of Taskrendel which contains the House of Masters, the only University of arcane study. Most impressive of all the cities is still the Capitol. Elrondel's palace is fit for an ancient dragon to walk the halls with ease and attended to by over a thousand servants. It's gilded walls retain the magic they were blessed with, rendering spells upon the royals useless. And king Ulariel is never without his blade, the famed Aenvyr. Even among Oathblades, the Sakura is legend, a sword that laid low the Lich, Acererak, and his legions of undead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elveron(H) - eastern. The entirety of Lesmire Lake and east until the coast. Capitol in Oceancrest. Orlan Elveron attained the status of high prince through wealth, buying seven baronys, four viscounties, and an earldom with gold from the trade on lake lesmire. Rising quickly, his house soon owned dozens more noble lands and enough relics to be considered a high princedom. Now, the Lord of oceancrest vies for the throne against the Dragon-who-walks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Farien - west of Lesmire Lake. Capitol in Sorenstone. Though a prince, Randenar Farien is all but subservient to house Elveron. Many nobles of his joined Elveron when promised gold, leaving farien with title only, and a single oathblade in the hands of his son.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jurith - south of Lesmire lake and north of Wyvernspine Ridge. Capitol in Wyverngrave. Many Jurith lands have recently transferred to Elveron, though the Firecrystal mines in Wyvernspine still remain in the hands of Seleres Jurith. Without plate or blade, as well as a lack of true highborn magic in his lands, Seleres openly bends the knee to Elveron for protection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eld Dalien - south of Wyvernspine Ridge until the coast. Capitol in Lyr Lital. The oldest princedom, Amerem Eld Dalien is a famed duelist, having won three blades in his youth. Much of the princedoms wealth comes from the wyvernscale armor they export. And while they may deny it, most would agree that the Eld Dalien commoners are slaves in all but name.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Moroe - east of Lesmire Lake, north of Karerak. Capitol in Greenstone. A small princedom hardly worth mentioning. The line of Moroe is tainted and it's lords weak. It is a matter of months, possibly weeks, before the Dragon-who-walks and his brother, the Lion-who-flies, descend upon Greenstone. Much as he prepares, the Lord of Greenstone and his army know inside that they are reaching the end of the line.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Karerak - south of Moroe. Capitol in Relmalin. A shadow of what it once was, Karerak learned first hand what it meant to defy Alvath and Alkathar. Even as the lithe prince Fandriel cut swathes through the countryside, scorching towns with barely a whispered word, the Dragon-who-walks fell upon Karerak cities like an archangel's sword. On the final night, the dragon crashed through Karerak's famed stained glass dome like a star falling from heaven and let any and all who dared to fight. When only one Karerak son remained, shaking in fear at the sight of a seven and a half foot man in gilded plate stained with blood, feathered wings stretched behind him, the dragon put the child on his father's throne. Now, the coward boy rules in his stead, though all know who the true lord of Relmalin is.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Well some people are also above averagely informed
Fuck your depresso
And heart 
Chronic cancer of the eye
Tldr. Aids
And my day is ruinex
I have aids
Mars your story is depressing as hell
And I can read roll20 finally
Im taking a train to the other side of the country tomorrow so I'll probably have it then
Yea. I actually have more for alkathar but I'm trying to figure out what's too detailed for a normalish citizen to know
Because soon I'll have to work too
Your life gave me depression
Why are you up so early
I've got this so far
Also I'm basically home since I'm not doing anythung
It was to help with people's new backgrounds
But I can't on my phone 
Well I was gonna try to draw hard outlines for the princedoms 
Yea
I downloaded it off roll20
Yea 
Lol I can't see shit
Damn. Idk I'll do it another time
Does anyone have it as a handout or smth
Oh wait it's the other chart that called
Motherfucker
Kys
Does anyone know how to get this chats map photo onto my phone
Yea that's always been ok. It's the same item you just pretend is uniquely built
One is literally a mages prank
Well beside the language ring it's just minor stuff
So it's still just there
Jett said he didn't take it
But yea just the ring was there then
Until you got smashed 
You didn't necessarily die 
Those are both neighboring. If you want far, Serthan rules in the far south just above the desert
Aleese is a dick if that's what you're going for
The closest princedoms to falconrest are Aleese who owns it, merelth, bralien, and high-prince Alvath
3 high-princes, 9 princes, and the king
Mars there's 12
Connor is the whitest guy I know
Yea
Or text me a screenshot
I can't go on roll 20 and check sheets mars so Skype the story to me
It's pretty dank
From a meta perspective Victor died getting a ring that was lost the next day lol
That's gonna be a big yikes 
He just happened to have it for less than a day 
One was a ring commissioned by a prince tho
All I need is common
Fuck understanding languages nigga
Apparently he didn't want it
So he left the other then
Ik he has the ring of fire
Idk. Would he have taken the ring off the bodies
My b
I forgot to mention those
So his sword and ring
Magic items don't
Did anyone take the ring of languages or is that on Tyrions corpse still 
idioit
yes
did you do it
so mars
throw that jew down the well
actually yea
7
1
2
3
stfu
mars
so are we all good
how could you do this to us
fuck you mars
cmonBruh
that's a fucking throwback
2018
in 2017
high school music
...
rehearsal
...
milos not busy so we can do 7
milo said 7 or 8
when you have purify food and drink
and yea food and water is too easy
technically nothing is unkillable
its a divine being
cause you know
just more powerful than you
also the angel wasn't unkillable
you should have 2 liters on a 10 mile hike
2 liters is if you aren't doing heavy activity
pastries live on the fruit quality but fruit is cheap
 pastries tho are the one food type that can be good cheap actually
you cant take the restaurant price which includes them and not put it on homemeade food
labor costs are a thing
just cause it didn't have meat
i wouldn't call it a good dish tho
in in italy
mars ive had that
isn't good
but just pasta
pasta is cheap
for cheap
ok how are you gonna make good food
literally
ive seen dogs eat shit
animals eat whatever you give them
jett were talking about people here
like who out there is gonna take the kfc when offered professional chicken
does anyone enjoy the taste of cheap food tho
milo you made the same point i did that expensive food tastes better
yea that's what i was saying
there you go
so...expensive food tastes better
and the demand would drop with the price
if it didn't have more flavor there wouldn't be so many people who like it
therefore it has better flavor
and are willing to pay for it
the more expensive it is the more people like it
supply and demand
price is exactly a way to measure quality
which i think everyone enjoys
expensive ingredients you have more room with so you can avoid eating things repetitively
and ill get the filet
ill get you the ground beef
aight. if i ever treat you to dinner
it probably is good for them cause most people never want to go outside their box of shitty things anyway
they can taste the difference but not like the better one
like most people cant taste which wine is better
that's not what im saying. they cant taste that the nicer one is better
tastes like goddamn cardboard
any liquid in a box
and he wont know the difference
and professional fried chicken
ok give a nigger kfc
but if you have a refined palate price does mean an increase of satisfaction
and therefore the price of the food doesn't matter
cant tell the difference
most people don't care
but jett you do see my point was wine is like food
im up for it
it just tastes like shit
box wine is less than that
so you should know your shit
its part of being and adult cause you have to drink with coworkers and your boss
my parents whole circle of friends has wine training
and has it
my dad drinks once a year
no most of them do
price does matter
but for those with a good palate
i didn't say liked it
eh

they found corellation
apparently across 6000 tests
because
this article?
but its not the best
you can get okay bottles for 20
its like wine
the higher the quality the more it costs for increases
no you wouldnt
nothing home cooked is the same
jett i literally go travelling every year usually just to eat at the nice places
but they can be
depends on which one
most famous place you've been
its hard to like the simple stuff
when the bar is that high
jett that's cause you haven't been to the places ive been
cause its easier than explaining i just don't like it
and not even real allergic
idiot
im allergic to fish
which vegetable wtf
because it tastes good
youre right it isnt
it doesn't go limp that fast
also you can candy a banana and cook it a bit
fried banana
cooked bananas are dank
bananas taste better tho
its so different
even fucking children know theres a difference
theyre different things
listen buddy
youre a monkey you should know that
plantains are not bananas
couscous has the worst texture ever
plantains are shitty bananas
couscous is awful
jerk chicken fuckin sucks
black beans are awful
plantains suck
jamaican lul
not be the only one
the spice is supposed to augment the other flavor
if all you can taste is the spice
yea but whats the point of having meat in there
yea but i want to taste stuff that isn't just spice
but any curry actually red or green in color usually goes past that mark
anything too spicy kills the other flavors
i like red curry that's yellow in color lul
does anyone like green curry
curry lul
maybe not in definition tho
nah i still stand by the best curries being yellow in color
that's the only time i like it
with saffron
good indian red curry is pretty dank
you know what tho
its far from an indian red curry
its yellow man
but id call it closer to yellow curry
its like an orange
nigga that's not red
that's yellow
and yellow
thai curry is like fruit curries
the only thing im looking forward to in Thailand is that thai curry tbh
like crab or lobster
cause it goes with seafood
i like fruit curry
like pineapple curry
idk man. sweet and spicy is good as hell
i like spicy with sweet
pure spicy is kind of plain
red imo is pure spice
lamb yellow curry
those that weren't would be a greater majorityh
if they were paid off
and a vast majority are good
but theres a lot of reviews
who knows
he might
but its not good
its not bad by far
its alright
common idiots just want to be full
yea cause their food is barely passable but its cheap
you don't see mcdonalds reviewed by critics the way you see shitty games like cod with 90/100s
and its well known too
no cause theyre all paid off by the company
and actually liking the place obv
i feel like the minimum of good food is a place where youd find known critics bothering to go
its dank as fuck
ive linked before
one of which
theres 9 places that actually have kobe
and theyd charge more than that for a filet
i could go down to a ranch rn
i think even from a farm you aren't getting it that cheap
i want to be there
tell me where i can get a rack of lamb for a dollar
and cheap meat just suuuuuuuuuucks
it doesn't matter how good your vegetables and sauces are if the meat sucks
the important part is the meat tho
but enough that its not frozen or Monsanto sprayed
not that much more
its not amazing
but just alright
the sauce and spice is alright
or with pesticide
cheap vegetables come frozen
no but the vegetables aren't worth mentioning
that's 2 packs of whole foods bacon
14 is pretty cheap...
meh
cheap lamb
chicken
which sucks
indian food that's cheap uses cheap meat
that place by my house
its bad
like twice
cheap indian food is pretty simple in flavor
usually simple at the least
or bad for you
simple
cheap food is either tasteless
whats cheap and good tho
not even like Michelin star stuff
i feel like middle class is the point where you can afford objectively good, like top 5%, food
the people trying to understand your statement
exclusive would mean that it can be one or the other onlh
its mutually inclusive
also mars mutually exclusive isn't the right term there
five guys is pretty far from good. its awful for you and definitely not fine dining
huh
five guys and good food
food is like a tangible way to enjoy your wealth
poor people cant afford good food
isn't that exactly what food is about
its pretty dumb
i had okay vegan food tho
gluten free sucks
shocking
wow
legit tho with how good the hippie stores are, maybe organic isn't bullshit
i feel like ive been gyped
where the fuck were these stores the last 18 years
cold and crunchy but still chocolatey with a tiny bit of spicy
10/10
i got a chocolate bar with coconut and some other shit
yea but theyre food is so good
fuck the old grocery stores
and its also really good
theres a new grocery store called erehwon where the magnolia used to be on wilshire
you know what. i always thought they just sold hippie shit
4 pieces for 6 bucks lul
yea just like a pack of bacon
but it wasnt
i thought itd be organic bullshit
holy shit
whole foods has really dank bacon guys
anyway brb
milos doing an essay
cause i like my steak basically mooing
you get it as hot as possible
ofc
that goes super hot
and one of those quickboiler burners
i have a grill pan
truffle salt and butter
sear a filet after you salt and pepper it
steak is easy af
scout food
and steak lul
mostly pasta
i know a few dishes
im gonna go make dinner. someone treat parsas autism while im gone
no youre just being dumb parsa
but not sat
he can fri
so by excluding sat but not fri
the only 2 days in the set were Friday and saturday
because milo explicitly said he cant today
no cause that wasn't in the discussion
if he cant Friday hed have said he cant friday
only you think it doesnt
yes it does
that go unmentioned
theyre implicitly including all the others
if they only take the time to exclude one thing
no that's how communication works
so...
only not saturday
he didn't say anything about not friday
some things re so implicit as to be explicit

its not that much later<legacyquote>

&lt;&lt;&lt; </legacyquote></quote>
how are you this dumb
even if we have to do it short and late
idk. im down for friday
or push it to sat
or milo just help her tomorrow
8 is fine if were willing to stay up a bit
youre an adult
I have a training call until then
yea
milo cant apparently
yea that's what I was saying
and I leave at like 10 ish
since we never start on time
I can do 6 but if my flight is midnight itll be a shorter than usual session
anyway the time rn is looking like Saturday afternoon
idk she just needed a ride
apparently school is still in cause I had to help annie ditch earlier
idk
&quot;homework&quot; or some shit
or gay
anyway. jett and mars. respond
changing crab a bit doesn't do shit
I still think they should just revert the jg to how it was before
baron goes from a living god at 20 to a slightly more dangerous dragon
rip dangerous baron tho
4 duskblade procs
but 6s of invis was
against good players the permastealth wasn't super effective
also that might be a kha buff tbh
7s darkness pls riot
but they didn't...
they said theyd buff noct
I want to
riot isn't even trying
xin loses .3 ad per level and 20% off his slow
are literally nothing
also those xin and graves nerfs tomorrow
abuse meta shit that takes coordination to outplay
haHAA
in the lp
get hit
talk shit
cant demote so I can int on anyone I don't like
man I love d5
after I inted repeatedly
you sound like this rakan I played with earlier
your new skype icon is weird dude
driving by it earlier
also I saw jerry at campos
ikr
yea lol
im leaving either sat midnight or sunday for Taiwan and Thailand until the 16th so if we want to do a session this week its gotta be sat for me or after 7 on fri
tsk tsk
lmao
30 min
don't pull a jett and go to whole foods
in sb or sm
5
Since your parents can be late sometimes
Since your parents can be late sometimes
Monday 5 so go back to sb around noon
yea but itll be funny
I said link me the best roasts
just link me the highlights
wait I never saw it
l m a o
50 dkp minus
jett type in the chat then
also if he ever bothered to talk in chatg
i mean you live together just ask him
I just assumed since you were fine
nigga wht
milo and jett
well it better not
well the plan was he leaves significantly before, like noon so that no matter how late his parents and traffic are hes back at 5
so just to confirm were Monday at 5 yea
&quot;Except health&quot;
was it tho
so that during the session there can be dynamic level up moments
also im thinking you should all add in the stuff you get at 3 except stuff you can add in fast like health
i just want you to finish so i can talk about it
well not actually but
and so you can have the rest of campaign spoiled lol
so i can actually talk to you about it
aight mars read more
syl is the best character
i liked dalinars politics a lot more
idk that point of kaladin was too mopey
the poison leaves?
idk. read faster then. the emotional stuff gets heavy with kal
he just mopes tho
syl and the cage was aight if i remember right
so i only remember a few key points from part 1
but once you get near the end it snowballs so hard. the second half took me a quarter the time the first did cause of how epic it got
idk the beginning was at like a 5 in terms of stuff happening cause it was mostly kal and dalinar doing stuff
id say you know dalinar well by the time he soloes a chasmfiend
with the spren harassing him?
she starts kinda lame but grows interesting
yea same until later
also the interludes
lmao book 1 was paced to me by shallan chapters
youd know that's not true at all
i mean if youd gone farther into stormlight
cause its uneventful
then it gets hard to keep track of whats happening
its boring when stuff doesn't happen
stuff going on is good
it took me a while to finish those two
idk. i finish stormlight books in a day
the series is the kingkiller chronocles
yea but it has to happen sometimes
than the prologue to the way of kings
youd think a book titled the kingkiller chronocles would have more dead kings
like the part where he becomes the kingkiller
he dances around all the interesting bits for 2 books
name of the wind was a drag
did you tho
im hyped tho. szeth book next
with the pace youre reading the next book is gonna be out by the time you finish oathbringer
cmon
konosuba s3 when
im gonna be sad when franxx ends
it wasn't meme enough
i never saw that
and then 3 to bring down papa
probably 4 with the memories and dealing with 001
7 episodes
and she tried to pilot her before
and she had ichigo pinned
they were already on the bed
yea but the rest of the shows probably them killing/joining the dragon princess
in a weird pose
and then they just talk on the bed
idk. im just salty they made it seem like ikuno and ichigo were gonna get it
diverse profile
guys and girls
2 people into her
ichigo is technically the most popular one if you think about it
blue is the warmest color style
and see that she should smash ikuno
ichigos only flaw is her inability to get over hiro
that's kind of relatable
and emotional connectivity problems
zero two has anger issues
hmm
scrawny and weak
w e a k
didn't 02 beat her up in the hospital too
right. cause shes weak
while idk which was the other girl that tried to go into rampage and almost died
and then went into rampage cat mode and continued to wreck shit
in less than a day
i want to bring up the fact that 02 killed what, 50 buff ass parasite dudes
im definitely triggered
for a long time
fuck ichigo
it was titled
it was literally the frontpage of our campaign
go offline
for a week
because it was the front screen of campaign
yes
is mature
at least knowing when to critically think
not blindly following authority
like when she kicks the ass of all the guards
and actually stands up to the authority
while nobody else really does
shes also able to resist their indoctrination
with knowing what sex and their inevitable death are
shes more mature than the rest
i don't think shes a kid
was hot
shes badass tho. her rampage mode in that fight without hiro
and stealing all their clothes
like a seal
also the balancing the ball on her nose
was one of the best episodes
her shit with dividing the house
actually miku is hilarious
stable as fuck
zorome and miku
just not the idiots from the 9s
and the guys
honestly tho i like all the girls
were the worst
the 4 episodes without her big ass smile
cute
was
it
no fuck you it was cute
the only healthy relationship
hiro and 02 is a healthy relationship
didnt
only fatass didng
also he had the balls to confess to ichigo
that's a good dude
to get it in with 02
he literally gives up his mech for hiro
goro is a bro
just the fat one
but then 1 or 2 are les
the funniest part is all the girls are hot
she married him lmao
also she goes right for the edgiest guy
and fucked first
but also kokoro literally gets her mind wiped cause shes a slut
no 02 stalks hiro into the shower
she stop being able to pilot when she thinks hes in trouble
either way shes pretty dependent on him
theres one where she stalks him into the shower
yea i don't remember half these scenes
also no tits
that seems like dependency
not 02
kokoro is the real slut btw
when goro is actually a better bro
either way ichigo is way too dependant on hiro
idk
ichigo is missing
yet another thing
look in the bubbles
second to last picture i put
theres a vag in there
the whole manga has tits
actually wtf
missing a lot of that
that
you know what ichigo is missing tho
and was the whole reason she almost left
she tried to keep zero two out
she sucks
i mean...no
smile &gt; justice
or the running down the hall with the clothes scene
or the one where shes like swaying
not better than happy zero two bouncing on the bed
not that its best
flat is justice just means flat is ok
tits &gt; no tits
i mean even as a meme tho
yea but only as a meme
her tits are small
no
she has the dumbest facial expressions
idk
and no glasses
shes hot with her hair down
that was a fucking jebait
also i really thought the purple haired chick was gonna rape ichigo
and drawn
but i think ditf is better written
its funny as hell
i don't think this is gonna be worse than a meme show
even konosuba had decent emotions
its an anime about emotions and people
i think its just her actually feeling human
I don't think its foreshadowing anything
to being haunted by their &quot;ghosts&quot;
she also went from not caring about the like hundreds of dudes she killed
after her horns and fangs grew
and she tried to kill him in the mech
that's why he had the big aids spot over his heart
for 10+ episodes
she literally was trying to drain him
nah she starts as evil and trying to kill him
all ichigo is is in love with hiro
zero two had way more development than ichigo
in the 2 minutes zero two is in the upgraded mech with hiro they get more kills than ichigo has in her entire life
than her with a partner
zero twos kill count is higher alone
that ichigo cant kill shit
still tho the point was
and they ride reversed lul
no I think theyre lab grown versions of her
theyre the cloned zero twos
theyre just assholes
while zero two solo is better than them
shes worse than all the 9s
although also ichigo does nothing special
pretty sure that wont kill an android
didn't like the smash
papa gay
that's what it is full blown
did you see the dragon lady
all the dinos have aids I think
worth
horns and dino aids
so he needs a dino partner
no he needs a retard alien to pilot because hes part dino
that's pretty alpha
he pilots a training mech just to get to zero two
idk
and alpha
while zero two thicc as fuck
ichigo has sticc titties
and I don't see ichigo in it
mars theres a whole episode devoted to their childhood
not late. like 5 or 6
she just freaks the fuck out every fight
her lesbian ass cant even pilot properly
ichigo sucks
ok so how the fuck are you gonna say zero two is worse than ichigo
what episode are you even on
also bitch has no dino horns
like dog shit on a shoe
and shes clung on him
hiro doesn't even love her
ichigo
fuck
because ill fight you
do you want to fight
ok
I think that's the best time
or like ask them to take you back at noon then we can start at 5/6  so even if theyre late its fine
just ask them if they can take you at an exact time
parsa when do you get back on monday
you don't even have class or anything
how the fuck are you always busy mars
league anyone
also
same
and has to go back to school
hes coming here for the weekend
what about Monday after parsa gets back to sb
and that we could do late ish at night
or smth
mars you also said youd be done at like 7
but I think parsas doing the whole going back to sb on Monday thing
bitch stop fucking with our scheduling. im fine with either tho
that like engl393 wiki has everything
its literally just the basic rules
1 subclass per class and like 1 subrace per race
like half the spells
well
no it has most spells and a few monsters
yea cause its not in the basic rules
ree
or anything else from books
except that all the spells from xanathars aren't in it
its actually the greatest thing
nah dragging from compendium nice as fuck
and manually do it
but I can read it
nah
hype
I found the tome of foes pdf
gnight idiots
so doing it irl is hard
mars is far
actually tho
but like itd be little drawn maps and minis
if everyone wants to do irl I'm not against it
no why
id be drawing on paper for maps
i mean i could but like
nah we'll do other irl shit
of anything
I don't have minis
no
sunday retard
get with it
weve been using autist as an adjective for a while now
you autist fuck
this is why you scored under a 30
this
I think
Fucking retard. Yes
a fucking gain
98lp
because public transport is meant for the poor so they don't care about it
not fucking cool
then 18
until I'm at 80
20 lp per game
hey riot what gives
but its annoying
he just ints top
yea
fuck that guy
PROFESSOR SINGED
I keep playing vs this nigger
whats wrong with you
mars
it would've put the meme on a new level
shaderkai are edgy enough too
It would've been
and a cantrip from 3
bonus action once per short rest
that gives resist to all damage until next turn
shader kai get a 15 foot blink
yea
you get to choose 1 of 4 each rest
fey step and a cantrip
the eladrin get nice bonuses
wtf is a mammon
zariel sounds like an angel
but theres legit like 9 new tieflings
theyre in a perpetual civil war so its one side or the other
no theyre always one of the two subraces
I don't think its ever just gith
or githyanki
well its githzerai
they broke the illithid enslavement
psionic I think
illithid servants
variants
theres also the gith
instead of fey elves
theyre shadowfell elves
shader-kai are lit
of fucking tieflings
a lot
Shadar-kai
Mephistopheles Tiefling
Levistus Tiefling
Githzerai
Fierna Tiefling
Dispater Tiefling
the new race is Gith
no theyre subraces
Zariel Tiefling
Sea Elf
Mammon Tiefling
Glasya Tiefling
Baalzebul Tiefling
Eladrin
Githyanki
and an official eladrin
a lot of tieflings
its cool
a shit ton of monsters
13 subraces
1 race
general release on the 29th
literally today on specific stores
time to find a way to pirate a pdf I guess
apparently the new tome of foes book is out in specific game stores
what
I'm down for either
well you know me. on break
same
you should all just kys and then were all set
scheduling
yay
leave it I guess
monks don't get perception cmon
lol
and if you get lost like that youll really be lost
so if you don't mapmake I wont show the marker of where you are on the map
and in case you ever return youll know the path easier
mapmaking is to make sure you know where you are on the map
theyre both to keep you on a consistent direction
tracking and navigating are similar
or you can double up on perceiving so the higher gets a +5 to passive
so they get advantage
although if youre proficient in survival, have a level in ranger, or have Keen Mind you can assist the navigator
you can only do one
so pace and duties are your big choices
the faster you go the harder it is to navigate and notice threats
up to 8 hours per day at 4/3/2 mph without getting exhausted
3 travel paces, fast normal, slow
well then. 5 duties while travelling, sort it out. foraging, navigating, tracking, mapmaking, and looking for threats
which is what rangers guarantee
or find you water
goodberry doesn't prevent you from getting lost
do you guys want to make overland travel more difficult and intricate, which would mean it takes longer, or just gloss over most of it like weve been and do a few encounters so the bigger stuff gets there faster
aight
doesn't have to be sat for me
also tho if you guys want we could do it Friday or sunday
he asked if she thicc
yea but that's not what he asked
endeavor sucks
you were right
oh I watched the sports arc
and the day was a lot chiller
and the night before was a crescent
also, the night after you left Kai at the temple of the moon, there was a full moon night
cough drakki cough
and not 6
the kind with 12 int
getting on call?
5 then
ok
yea 4 or 5
lul
sat
you remember how last week we were like &quot;we'll just do next sat with milo&quot;
ok that's what I thought
weren't we agreed on saturday
but at least with 3
kind of
still
I'm tilted
yea ik
I mean I could but id rather do main
otherwise we just wait
continue w/o or find a new?
well what do you want
right?
ok then next then
idk. you and mars said this but I haven't heard from milo or miles
this is the only one I don't have muted
ree
typical
idk depends on how long they plan on waiting for the main
which is draining
the thing is though, we spend so much time out of character during sessions its probably 2:1 in ratio
after next week I'm done with finals tho
idk. I wasn't gonna do this week no matter what lol
just the once
yea
2
while were on break
why are you even making a new char
you think anyones gonna forget
l u l
sequentially
its right there
but like cmon
inside other stuff
maybe if it was hidden
subtle
real
fuck overwatch
but really
not rn but soon lul
so I'm gonna sleep early
also I didn't sleep last night
ew
overwatch
?
this is your culture
cmon
are totally different mars
joint
a super blunt and a super join
were going at 6 anyway tho
k
What
Miles and Parsa?
And eat beforehand or smth
What about 530
Aight
What's everyone else's schedule like
After 2. I'm in SM rn
I'm not raiding anymore
point is
I didn't know there was a max deaths limit on the argus fight so I solo took up about 1/3 of the tree's lives
its not great
I actually die to raid finder as dps
or tank
or heal
I don't actually know how to run heroic/mythic
yea
so theres just league
and I cant wow
the museums are closed nearby and theres a protest anyway so I cant go out
but theres nothing else to do
I agree
and I'm bored now
I got kicked off my wow acct
get on league
idk
ik
does that mean every other day
you said not thurs
parsa and miles
fix your fuckin schedule i guess
so it might just be that one person gets a delayed start
when we usually dont
idk. this week is pretty bad apparently cause we have 3 days straight out
milo joins in next time
or if more people can make friday
you know
he can join on the road next session
i mean if we plan for sat and mars has work then
later
its not that bad introducing the last guy on the road
i mean the better way is see which day more people can make it
omegalul
yea. mostly cause im not gonna be up till like afternoon the day after
so fuck it
idk. id rather do friday tbh but i can do sat
yea actually
and get out of it
kys
mars if you have work that day
cancer
just saturday
so basically
aight
that would be
also when can you guys do this week
there cant be a tie this time
vote 1 for that style and 2 for the hearthstone map style
so temporarily oceanfront is available again to be viewed
just tell the bitch to fuck off
I guess we'll just never know what the events ended as
but yea. if we don't end up doing it
we waiting for miles to finish a league game
its fine
but no matter what I'm done with campaign 1 tonight
so we don't know if milos going to smth
late
we finished
k
yea
and its starting in 5
we have 1 game left
we'll be done around 7
aight
ye

or 3
so either were done in an hour
lul
were locking in
aight team
if we lose its over at like 6 tho lol
at the latest
about 8
that's not how I interpreted that
so yea after clash works
I mean if we cant win with lucas we cant with marisa
oh nice
but doesn't mars have work
I mean I'm down to leave that
loser bracket
we have to play all 3 anyway

and idk whats the situation with miles
I think milos getting pasta
k
can miles
well were done with clash
I'm in game
can you ask miles and parsa
cause were done in less than an hour
we could do it after clash
cause if we get fucked I'm not playing this tomorrow
tomorrow maybe
k so clash is happening
I did
wtf
jets in que
cause rn I still cant load so idk if they'll have time
like if jett/lucas don't get it locked in
yea I'm just saying if
aight

lul
you guys wanna do tonight
so if clash doesn't happen
so whenever yall have 3-4 hours

lol
lets gooo
right now you say
Its done for when you guys are
k well
wut
campaign when tho
aight
mars when are you back
no matter if hitler supplies it
Neutrality means taking any money you can
chaotic dead
anyone gives me
or some other suitably dank idea
one shot possibilities: monster hunter
&quot;The Wild Sheep Chase&quot;
&quot;The Wolves of Welton&quot;
battle royale tournament
&quot;honey heist&quot;
mars you get triple gay
you guys wanna run a short one shot of some kind instead? something memey with inspiration or some other small reward for the final fight to the winner
ok so mars def cant do this weeks session
who knows, there might even be foreshadowing in it
Edited previous message: anyways, a bio is up for the Twins<e_m ts="1522807772" ts_ms="1522807772773" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
anyways, this is up for the Twins
or just play league and wow all weekend lul
we could run that monster hunter/some other pop culture one shot this week instead
its unlikely everyone can do tomorrow so we might have to postpone it
cancer
Thursday?
so what do you have this weekend
so we usually do thurs-sun
tomorrows wednesday
when are you all gonna have the bios read
Any being you host risks being consumed. Evil ones just tend to not care about holding back
so the point is, be careful with what you choose to host
or even seconds with the Twins
its entirely possible to burn through a host within an hour
by possessing the body more fully
so part of why the chronomancer goes through hosts so fast is because she chooses to do so
the more it is the quicker you burn out
it also depends on how much power the divine being is channeling through you though
as you would've been eventually
so whoever Ai Ueihara was before she was possessed is certainly doomed
like the chronomancer is one of the spirits who goes through hosts within a century
depending on the strength of the spirit it takes between two decades and upwards of two millennia
even for a god it would take a long ritual
that's not enough
like prolonged exposure to one of the Dynasty Spirits is the common way for it to happen
the only ones you cant bring back as a god are those whose souls have been burned away by divine possession or other great power
tldr
so i guess the answer is you CAN bring people back
honestly, if the demigods had been telling the truth you would've had a sweet gig
nobody knows what the criteria is to be selected. the Dynasty preaches that theyre the chosen people but anyone has a chance to be chosen
But it doesn't have to be a Dynasty hero
the only time you include Huang is when explicitly talking about another dynasty as well
around the world its assumed if you say dynasty it means Huang
Dynasty citizens
but its a rare afterlife that few earn, essentially like the Isle of the Blessed. Its for those particularly favored by the Jade Emperor such as those who were reborn as Jade Guardians or a rare hero
that's the only afterlife that gods cant reach because their abilities are null there
any god can bring someone back unless they've entered the Jade Gardens
lol
is nothing
so basically, the power to make things better
nbd
hunting, survival, and nature
over the domain of death
just hope you don't end up like the chronomancer's hosts
mortals able to host the gods are rare though. so at least youre special enough
but youre fanvara in the same way a drop of water is the ocean
probably
the small bit of fanvara in lyreth right now is the closest hes been to her since she ascended
and any place a goddess could manifest naturally is hallowed
essentially. as an archfey he couldn't manifest in hallowed grounds
but once she went past the divine gate he had no chance
if she had simply died, an Archfey could easily bring her back
because she was in the only place he couldn't reach
that's also part of why Anyeira's depression ran so deep
nope
although her ancestors were birthed before fanvara's ascension
but if you look at it, lyreth is a lot closer to the divine than the other elves i guess
theyre literally born from sehanine
also, all elves are descendants of a goddess
nope. tbh by now you should have enough of her tale to piece it together
the same way the Raven Queen is Rainarra
since you got all your knowledge from the gods that possessed you, they know her by her name
the Huntress
i believe they all start with the same first paragraph essentially
they all have bios similar to Ai rn
yea it was just so youd think they were going to be there
i think it was legit shit like &quot;this is the firekeeper&quot;
i know that cause it was today lol
i did write bios for them but after i made them hidden
i think they were just pictures except for the daughter
did I do bios for them?
has a bio up now
I think the summary is that everyone in the final fight
its been there since forever
also carius has bio text
everyone knows you put it in script
who sets it to symbol
at all
subtle
it wasnt
isn't high
so my expectations for what yall will read
I know you didn't read anyeiras handout until I told you what he was
at least this way you might
stfu. I know none of you cucks would've read it there



The spirit known as the Chronomancer was born from the Son of Heaven and the goddess Yui during the Alignment, last of the five children born from their union. As with her brothers, the Chronomancer was charged with guarding one of the universe's core flows. Hers was the ever-present turning of time, her duty to prevent any from manipulating it for their own gain. For untold eternities, the Chronomancer did her work in silence, unknown by any of the multiverse's countless denizens. 
Her presence might have gone undetected forever had the Wellspring not been discovered by mortals. On the world of Anscilus, a young race known as humans uncovered a relic from the Alignment, a pond in which two fish swam. Unknown to them, the gold and silver yue within were fragments of power left from when the Twins forged sun from which the world drew light and the moon for whom the tides turned. To prevent the misuse of the power, the Twins and their children were allowed upon the material plane for the first time, tasked with guarding the Wellspring.
While her brothers took to their new task in solemnity, the Chronomancer embraced the new world with great wonder. Burning through mortal hosts at great speed, she used each one as a new life to live, a new experience. This drew the ire of her family who made the most of each host, using a single body for upwards of a millennia. And while her family chose to remain aloof, aiding the people around them in subtle ways, the Chronomancer openly blessed those who came to her for assistance.
Eventually, four foreigners came to her with a tale of a dark goddess risen in the east and plead for her help. As usual, she openly offered it, though they sought her siblings as well. Without the bulk of her memories, she sought out her family and attempted to convert them to her cause as well. While the rest tried to use these heroes as new hosts, the Chronomancer remained true to her word and arrived to assist them against the risen Lilith. Now, she stands ready to face the Reaper alongside the avatars of Pelor, Bahamut, Ioun, and Fanvara.
Lyrna El'ilan was once a mortal Eladrin who sailed with her kin across the Jade Gardens on a ship sung from the World-Tree upon which the Feywild rests. During their arduous exodus, the ideals of the Eladrin formed into beings that embodied their tenets. These beings would come to be known as the Gods, as when they left the nullification of the Jade Gardens their true power was revealed. The Eladrin would come to revere the Gods as their parents, for it was from them the Eladrin learned to live and survive in a world that would not have them. Alongside the Gods, the Eladrin defied the Precursors and were able to undo the ancient bindings they had placed upon the land and its inhabitants.
Though all the Eladrin loved the Gods, none loved them as much as Lyrna. When duty called and the Precursors arrived to scourge the lands of Eladrin, Lyrna was always first to take up arms alongside the Gods. At the side of Cyndelion, Lyrna learned the ways of war and mastered the grim art of killing by any means necessary. At the side of Avandella, Lyrna first opened the pathway to the Arcane, loosing the power of the Jade Emperor into the world. At the side of Mymilion, Lyrna first forged the Seven Reapers. Swords forged with the power of gods, their only purpose to slaughter. 
When next the Precursors came, Lyrna wielded the first of the Seven against them. On that day, the Day of the Emerald Sun, the blade Nierya is said to have killed the first Pit-king to fall. From then on, Lyrna was driven by an obsession to prove herself to the Parents. Always striving to do more for them, to spend more time in their presence, Lyrna earned the position of their most exalted child. Never satisfied, Lyrna sought to help more, to kill more of their foes. Seven moons passed as Lyrna forged her weapon in secret. Even the Gods knew nothing of the blade they aided in forging, trusting their favorite child in all her endeavors.
On the eighth moon, Mirthal was born. A violet blade, forged of the same techniques that created the Seven yet without the locks on its strength imposed by the Gods. An eighth blade, the one never meant to exist. Lyrna expected the Parents to be proud of her initiative, glad to have a new weapon with which to drive the enemy back. Yet she was met with open revulsion, a disgust that she could bring into existence such a creation. For, while Mirthal was indeed capable of driving the Pit-kings back to the vile temples of their God, the sword was possessed of Lyrna's thirst for blood.
When the Gods saw Lyrna's true nature, they turned away from their favored child. Her mentors refused to help her any longer, and even those she considered friends wouldn't speak with her. From that day until the end of the First War, Lyrna did her grim work alone. She watched in silence as the Precursors wounded the Parents without her at their side. Cyndellion was the first to fall, split by the Precursor God into Corellon and Melora. Soon after fell Avandella, becoming Avandra, Eranthis, and Sehanine. Last of her mentors to fall was Mymilion, becoming Moradin. In grief, Lyrna hunted down and avenged those most responsible for the wounds, bringing silent death to the Void Priests that had called their God.
At last the war ended as mortals drove the Precursors back to their shadowed home and banished their dark god to the void from where he had come. As the other Eladrin were honored individually by the Parents for their role and blessed with immortality and potency, Lyrna merely watched. Though rebuked, Lyrna felt satisfied with knowing she had an eternity to look forward to with her Parents. When the Gods revealed their intent to leave to Elysium and watch the world from afar, Lyrna finally snapped. 
The moment Moradin stepped through and sealed Elysium, Lyrna turned Mirthal against her own people. Weaving a song of power and death, Lyrna killed near half of the other Eladrin before dashing away to the far corners of the world. On that day, Lyrna El'ilan became Lilith Du Wyrthen, the Reaper. From then on, she hunted those who could not defend themselves, eliminating entire civilizations in an attempt to draw the Parents back. As a result, the fledgling humans, tieflings, orcs, and all other races wove tales of a death goddess whose very word brought calamity. Across Anscilus, cults to the Dark Mistress sprung and gave offerings to stave her off.
From this worship, Lilith attained godhood. Empowered by the fear of a million souls, the Reaper ascended to the title of god. Even so, the Reaper feared the death her people did not. Those she had slain rose again in fresh bodies and hunted her across continents and oceans, seeking her final death. In her fear, Lilith forged her final Behelit, storing her soul within it so that she would always return if slain. In her weakened state following the severing of her soul, Lilith's brother, Gilderion, slew her upon the Field of Lights. But in the moment to be the Eladrin's salvation, her darkness overcame him and devoured his mortal frame as he attempted to shatter the Behelit.
Learning from Gilderion's attempt, the other Eladrin hid her other creations where none would seek them. Most importantly, Mirthal was sealed at the heart of the elemental plane of Water. Yet such things never stay hidden long. Eventually, the sword found its way into the collection of the Eladrin Prince, Qisilmar, reborn as he was without the burden of his past memories. In his arrogance, the Prince thought nothing of the cursed blade and offered it to an adventurer as a reward for aiding in his power grab. The moment Yew Pravaal attuned Mirthal, the Reaper was born anew. 
Taking over Pravaal's frail body at the coronation of Carius Vitai, Lilith broke free and once more slaughtered innocents by the thousand. When the dust settled, the Reaper was gone, off to find where her soul had been hidden. Beneath the mountain halls of Trojnheim, Lilith claimed her power and collapsed the ancient city. Rising from the rubble, she began her work in earnest. On this day, the Thirty-third of Reaping, four heroes stand against her for the fate of Gisildor, aided only by Pelor in the broken body of Carius Vitai and an ancient Demigoddess known as the Chronomancer.
so now you can know who youre fighting with/against
bios are up for Lilith and the Chronomancer, and Carius's is still there
never

&lt;&lt;&lt; </legacyquote></quote>
planning on playing a caster
is anyone
shes a dick
its not her
if I had to pick an npc to be waifu
so we'll see
I'm gonna say 6 but like you always surprise me with how quick you get shit done
or just go tarasque/ancient dragon hunting
or whatever
idk. I figured you guys would do some shit like making your own empire
like if you want to do some epic level stuff with those pcs
well I don't want to force it
but setting 2 was my planned long campaign
where what you do influences the future
and be a brief thing before setting 2
idk I wanted setting 1 to be like the golden age of the planet
yea cause I didn't know where to go
in the way of her being the finale?
but im ok with where it is rn. I just wanna know where people want to go after
if you want to abandon volar and carius that's always been on you
I mean that's up to you
but with the original plan campaign 1 wouldn't feel so short
I don't mind continuing either its just like lillith was planned to be the finale and I planned this next setting for after
that was just a thought
idk
or no
or more
also would anyone want a 5th
from like 1700s to 12-1400s
also new setting will be darker. like quality of life goes down after the magic leaves
but I wanna know what you want for after
idk. its far off cause lillith is far off
but not around
and depending on the endings of your current characters they might still be influencial
the new one would still be on anscilus and would take into account whatever changes during the path to lillith
rip
I can explain the setting better
wait join a call with me
you could still play magic classes tho
and opinions
leave thoughts
idk
and so the young races were left to fend against threats alone
magic items are pretty much the last remnants of magic and are therefore extremely rare and valuable
and with them a lot of the magic in the world
itd be very low magic. like some time after the events of campaign one the elves and eladrin left
that I have a couple setting changes for
so either its epic level campaign or a new one in the future of anscilus
cause rn I'm gonna be honest. youll be level 20 after her death
and would you rather continue after lillith or starting a campaign in the future
how attached is everyone to their character
scale of 1-10
why you gotta hate on our boy carius
yea. miles and parsa?
lul
yea I forgot his birthday
but idk if everyones ready
I guess the best plan is start now and take a short break when you have to get your dog so that way its done by 6
for that game
the people in the game can use it
nah its if the gm has it
everyone in that game can use mobile
yea if youre in a game with someone that has membership
and don't you as well
you should be able to since I have the membership
i don't particularly want to do that either

I thought you had class thursday
so hopefully hes fine
he was either ok or gonna die in a few days but afaik hes not dead
idk I'm not on top of things rn
or lung issue
I think helios had a heart issue
depends on if the TA lets me off the hook for the meeting
but I probably should visit thursday
I actually dunno much cause ive been working on a midterm
and he had it removed
idk its a gallbladder issue
it was never his heart before?
otherwise lmk when you can do between Friday and sunday
so I could do it then if that's the only time
so between like noon and 7 I MIGHT be free
but tomorrow I'm supposed to visit my dad in the hospital but I also have a group meeting at 7

Carius's updated bio
Born to Vermache Vitai, Carius is heir to the greatest fortune of the entire Gisildian Empire. The Vitai name is found on mines and farms across the empire, however they are most known for the Dragonshaunt Mine. This is the only mine in which Dragoneye is mined and the source of the Vitai's great wealth. Though he is young, Carius is already arrogant from the luxury his birthright has afforded him. Famously incompetent and petty, Carius is believed to be the worst of all the Imperial contenders. For this reason, the Sorcerer-Prince Qisilmar has backed his bid for the throne, pushing him headfirst into the position of Hope. As the Emperor's Hope, Carius is the successor to the Emperor, the redemption of all people in the empire. Hopelessly lost and unprepared, he has been tasked to Gemi for guidance to grow him into a suitable emperor.

Conning his newfound caretakers into aiding him to complete his Path of Kings, Carius set out to ascend the Tower of Vark. On the first night, Carius offended Pelor with his ill-thought offerings and failed to receive the Blessing of the Dawnfather as a result. With the wisdom of Gemi, Cheqir, and Letho, Carius managed to secure the Blessing of Nature from Melora. Arriving at Earthhorn village, Carius found the Vale of Ancient Kings inaccessible due to the workings of a Cambion that had been lurking among the villagers. Outraged, the Gisildian Hope swore to draw the Sword of Morning as Ygrim the Redeemer once did. Promising to slay the giants and the demon-born that had harassed the villagers, Carius fought through the Cavern of Trials and entered the Vale of Ancient Kings. Within the confines of the planar merge, he made his final offering to the Huntress herself. After advice from Pravaal and Gemi, the Huntress granted her blessing to the Hope. With the final blessing secured, Carius was able to enter the Tower of Vark and face the Dawnfather. Fighting through waves of those he had wronged, the Hope proved himself to the Dawnfather and walked up the second layer of the Tower. As he and his four chosen stood in wait, the Winter Queen arrived to administer her trial. The first to do so in centuries, Carius was able to solve her dilemma with the help of his friends and prove himself to the goddess. Atop the Tower of Vark, Carius was faced with Corellon, Lord of Magic. The King of Spring deemed him worthy enough for having secured the favor of the Winter Queen, instead opting to test those he kept as company. Easily enough, the four were able to escape the Fey-dream and witness Carius draw the Sword of Morning with Corellon's assistance.
â€‹
â€‹From that moment, Carius Vitai was no more. As the Sword of Morning once again reforged itself into the Dawnblade, Carius was reforged by the will of Pelor. The mortal prince was no more, becoming infused with the divine powers of an Archangel. When the light faded from the Tower of Vark, Carius stood alone among mortals as a divinity. Among the Halls of Elysium rang the choir bells as once more a Paladin-King was born from human flesh. Cleaned of his doubts, fears, prejudice, anger, and greed, the redeemed Carius found himself both physically and mentally purified. Returning to Ironstone a new man, Carius has begun the setup for his coronation and the reinvention of his empire. Alerted to the machinations of Qisilmar, Carius seeks allies from the other bastions of human freedom, a rarity in Anscilus.
just not green enough
such a deep green
iyoguja
no its the northeastern part of the middle continent
you always have versions
that's the thing about digital
this is with the serpent instead
gay
thats uh
it was dank
idk. there was a brief moment i used that picture for carius
he looks white to me
remember jesus carius
at least part of it
finally got around to working on iyoguja
idk ive been pretty lazy making other continents
but cannibalistic
its like nelly
and other plesiosaurs
that fly too close to the sea
thats like a cr 14 and hunts dragons
i have an idea for one
the rest of gisildor's cities are too small to fit
btw ironstone is like the size of one of those small cities
so you could have them fight dragons
yea i think it should be like cr 11
and cause if it was cr 1 druids could shift into one lol
cause its just a beast
a sea bear
thats actually a glorified bear
that's pathetic
time to find a plesiosaur statblock
well shit
but i like the plesiosaur
theres a second one where hes a serpent
its cute
yea but like
waters
dangerous
idk i just put it in there to imply dangerous waters
its a sea monster
this is a real kingdom
gisildors just some small island nation
I'm not even gonna pretend theres some other reason
: )
yea I mean I make the maps I get to satisfy my vanity
id actually just kms if I had to do them all like oceanfront
but like I can actually do a bunch of cities if I do them the other way
same after making it
dun dun dun
ignoring the deity lurking in the shadows
paladin of pelor carius
smites like a god carius
I hate the new carius
straight from the mansion carius
but it seems harder
yea
on an area
than adjusting colors
how is that easier
but like
I miss the old carius
so if you dye your hair are you gonna change the picture
like 4 liters of pure dye
I mean that's a lot of dye
understandable
lul
ez clap
walk to a tailor, ask for dye
its literally never been hard to acquire dye

omegaLUL
I cant do tonight cause I got a midterm at 7
idk someone said not friday
I'm good any time except sat
ik you guys said tomorrow probably wont work but is anyone down sunday?
like they did in other editions
you know that's exactly the reason they didn't stat the gods in 5e
and eladrin aren't elves theyre spirits in physical form
because they don't know what an eladrin is
but humans and other younger races know them as high elves
high elves aren't actually elves, theyre eladrin
anyway then were clear
its stressful to think
yea but you still think when you meditate
even if I didn't feel tired id just want a break where I don't have to think
being actually unable to would drive me mad
weird. I love sleeping sometimes
and unwind
it lets you take a break from the day
sleeping is great
and be half like them
since all he asked for was to not have to sleep
it was the ability to change appearance and immunity to mind reading
because I just went with high elves out since I didn't think anyone knew eladrin
so then were agreed that if I call them eladrin youll know what I mean
in order to keep his
or half the eladrin racials
yea he didn't get the 2 str
with slightly pointed ears
elves are still the long lived mortals
yea so were calling them eladrin now
since being immortal and able to train for eons means nothing until you've lived them
besides socially
honestly unless youre a ranger/wizard it doesn't affect your character much
and any new friend you make disappears by the time you turn around
in what seems like the blink of an eye
especially as you watch your descendants pass on eventually
but being trapped in the weave for eternity isn't a great fate
a gift
because for your mortal life it is just that
as anything but a grand gift
the thing is though that you were never meant to become one
its a spiritual thing
although I guess it isn't anything physical
you just haven't gotten to them yet
but they usually get there because of their long lives
I don't think anyone has elves that are just born a dozen times stronger than men
humans are all freed in the end
not in their physical life but in their death
that's true but humans get more of a benefit for just being humans in a way
and know peace and freedom that the elves could never attain
if anything they struggle more because they weren't god's chosen children. they secured the world and were corrupted by the worst of its evils so that the humans who were Iluvatar's favorite would have their day and age
they struggle the same as humans
that was at the start of their existance
silmarills
they had to deal with faenor and everything that followed because of his similaris
and morgoth
tolkeins elves fought against the valar
depends whose elves you look at
â€œâ€¦ people didn't seem to be able to remember what it was like with the elves around. Life was certainly more interesting then, but usually because it was shorter. And it was more colorful, if you liked the color of blood.â€
perfect
clear
simple
I prefer &quot;Just Monika&quot;
that takes too long to get the meaning across
still my favorite quote
â€œElves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.
Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.
Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.
Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.
Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.
Elves are terrific. They beget terror.
The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning.
No one ever said elves are nice.
Elves are bad.â€
on any other theyd be slaved already or at least servient to the true inheritors of the world
the real heresy is how humans managed to claim the better part of a continent as their own
so this is just some weird  shit to him
or went on
lmao miles actually didn't hear any of what goes on
that's an instant strikeout
you creeped her out the day you met her
what
uh
its understandable you cant tell
I don't think you've met an eladrin in character for more than a few minutes at a time
think of how beautiful the world would be without the humans
wouldn't it be ideal if everyone was eladrin though
pussy
didn't you advocate for not-genocide
well youre gonna love my gnomes
are yordles subhuman
id be done with all this shit
if only it were 2 days from now
I'm dead
ive got both a paper, a board game due tomorrow and a fucking midterm
but it wont fucking work
that I'm trying to get onto this comp
its a card for a board game
removed it
saved it
so I just sent an image to skype
my ipad cant email cause our wifi is weird
even if its the worst cancer ever to set up
I actually really like this lighting
so were calling them eladrin
when theyre actually spirits that happen to take physical form
and just a more refined version of the common elves
because high elf implies theyre still mortal
eladrin in this case is the word for high elf
no that's a feat
those are just the ones I made first lol
dude I have like 50 more bookmarks
kms
actually
kms
lighting
dynamic
full
its probably easier than drawing that
honestly you could just take the original and edit the color balance of the hair area to be red
this has the eye color right tho
and flamboyancy
I mean you asked for elfhood. it comes with pointy ears
lul
or might not
who might have a shirt
see, if you crop it its just a portrait of a guy
its not exactly maroon but like its close enough
omegaLUL
well if you crop the top one you cant tell
more anime than before
edgier than before
gayer than before
gemi v2
rip
for how long he can hold her back
its the fact that hes now on a timer
yea, its not the big part of mirthal though
The Cursed Sword Mirthal, the Hemlock. 
Mortal End: The sword is a +2 longsword, increasing to +3 at level 14. This bonus increases by +2 against humanoids. When you kill a humanoid, you gain 1 sadism point. Keep track of these on your character sheet.
Twisted soul: You become Eladrin, Chaotic Evil, Female, and Fae for purposes of enemy type.
True Evil: You have advantage on Persuasion checks with Evil entities, advantage on Intimidation against Good entities, and disadvantage on inverse rolls. Once per day, you can cast Power Word: Torture, targeted at a good-Aligned Humanoid. For each good entity killed, roll a d6. On a 6, you can cast it again. Casting this word renders you unable to cast any other spell for the rest of the day, taking 1d10 per level of the spell if you do. For each evil neutral enemy caught inside, take 1d6 damage in the aftermath. Casting this spell causes the spirit of Lilith to gain more control over your personality.
Unending hunger: When you land a mortal blow on a humanoid, they must pass a DC 17 Charisma Save or be drawn into the blade. For every 3 souls in the blade, you gain +1 to Dexterity. The souls are released at dawn when Saranrae frees the damned from Mirthal. Having souls within renders potions useless for you. Drinking a potion frees the souls within.
Power Word Torture:
10th-level Enchantment
120ft Range, 30ft Radius, Must be targeted at a Good-Aligned Humanoid
Targets caught in the spell must make a DC 20 Constitution save or take 16d12 Psychic damage. Should they survive, they take the damage repeatedly until they succeed the save on the start of their turn. Any being killed by this spell is doomed to an eternity in the Nine Hells.

<ss type="heart">&lt;3</ss>
i wanna build a cave
honestly dynamic lighting looks sick
fucking 100mb limit
like i deleted everything im not using atm and its still over cap
so i just gave them 5 bucks
im over storage cap by a lot
but I'm gonna try
idk how I'm gonna use it for this
i got dynamic lighting
I gotta setup lighting
yea
wut
otherwise I'm still good for 7
if you guys wanna do it earlier
good news. I'm actually free tomorrow at 5 and not 7
cheqirs slave boy
fucking cato
townswomen upon seeing pravaal
&quot;OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING&quot;
at least he picked a good corpse to be a tank
this bitch over here with 21 ac
that's the dank part
nobody wanted shadow gemi with them
you don't get him if we do another 2v2
and pravaal tanks
letho tanks
but
literally just a tank for you
did you make cato
ibba
ayran
yea same
its really good on the transition
yea but normally you have to click it
that just plays
howd you post a gif in skype
same
3 min
in case anyone wants a different feat before next session
TEMPORARY HIT POINTS Temporary hit points arenâ€™t cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you donâ€™t add them together, unless a game feature says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep
BONUS ACTION SPELLS If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 bonus action, remember that you canâ€™t cast any other spells before or after it on the same turn, except for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action
ROUND DOWN Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.
idk just hope they aren't quick enough
not a fireball you cast
oh wait
careful spell
metamagic
Fuck you. You went to the forest omegalul
I get up by like 10 so it doesn't matter much
if were all available
I can start earlier
Lemi 2 - 0 Chavaal
you guys go check
well I'm finishing hw rn so id rather do it if I knew everyone was
I can do this rn
if milo and miles are also on
s u p fucker
so if youre here just lmk
like I could just do this rq if everyone hopped into this chat for 10 min and then after youd all have decided if youre gonna split into smaller groups for a session or two or sticking together
honestly, its probably easier to just skip all this if everyone else doesn't mind just getting to the part with the emperor

Cheqirs teleportation circle deposits you in a cube room lined with marble that you don't recognize. As you materialize, two guards in viridian robes jump in surprise but allow you to exit when you show your bracelets. They lead you through faintly decorated halls, from which you can see lines of commoners attempting to enter the city and being checked individually by guardsmen in gold armor. You exit the building and enter the city proper.
Before you lies a sprawling city whose scope is difficult to imagine. You walk through the markets as you watch people of all races buying and selling their goods. A multitude of towering castles and immense watchtowers dominate the skyline, a constant reminder of the watchful eye of the nobility. Like in Cinthal, it is mostly crimson-clad guardsmen keeping the order, though you see golden guards walking the various watchtowers. In the background of your vision is a titanic dark mountain with a shining palace built into it. Spires that reach into the clouds erupt from the palace, each bearing the flag of Gisildor.
As you walk through the city, you see youths brawling in bustling markets. You see noblemen on their steeds pushing their way through the common folk as they rush to their appointments. Various merchants attempt to peddle their wares to you, boasting of the quality of their art, arms, fruits, etc. Before you can reach the Inner Circle, a group of ragged children approach you, begging for coin.
or I could do it for 10 minutes rq and then youd know if youre splitting or staying together
ill just do the going to Ironstone over text since I think that's what everyone agreed to do
but since I don't wanna get to the next session and then you guys decide &quot;were gonna split for a session or two&quot; then id have to pick one to run
and since neither task would take a long time, I might just do 2 - 2 or 3 - 1 split sessions until theyre done
so there might be a chance the party splits for a little bit while cheqir solves the problem with her mom and the others may choose not to
so if you currently have more I guess find one to unattune
btw, you all know you only can attune 4 items right
yea, theyre totally different. Arcane is like actually learning and knowing spells whereas Divine is just having the spells in your mind from your god
slowly and with books
like any other wizard learns spells
and lecture to them
youd have to sit them down
but you cant just walk up and be like hey look heres how magic works
neither of them are that dumb
it would probably work eventually
except maaaaaaybe pravaal
nobody in your party has a basic understanding of arcane spells though
Sounds dank
Yea. But if you want to summon demons go for it
Not in eluras
Or have a Warlock/wizard
We don't know any demon true names there tho
cough
cheqir
only one of you gets the spell I think
if you want actually scary demons it would probably be some kind of ritual
and this is an instant cast spell
youre also fighting other things
idk if you can solo one at level 7
as long as you can control it
that's at least as effective as you are in combat
for a cr 5 demon
you can cast it at level 7
its probably worth more at lower levels
yea but a cr 10 demon is worth 4 10th level pcs
theyre just better than lesser demons
those aren't really greater demons
you cant summon greater demons. the spell summons up to cr 10 demons at 9th level
the only issue is saying its true name shouldn't give it disadvantage it should just make it unable to save
so they probably want to attack things
yea, theyre just constantly angry and sadistic
its compelled to just kill
theyre demons...
that makes sense
you lose control of the demon
yea cause theres a cool summon demon spell in xanathars
or just undead
do necromancers summon demons
interesting
thats
theres literally an invincibility spell
create tyler1
CREATE HOMUNCULUS 6th-level transmutation CastingTime:1 hour Range:Touch Components:V,S, M (clay, ash, and mandrake root, all of which thespell consumes,and a jewel-encrusted dagger worth at least 1,000 gp) Duration:Instantaneous Whilespeakingan intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking 2d4 piercing damage that canâ€™t be reduced in any way.You then drip your blood on the spellâ€™s other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus. The statistics of the homunculusare in the Monster Manual.It isyour faithful companion,and it dies if you die.Whenever you finish a long rest,you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence asyou.When you doso, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it.Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculusâ€™s hit point maximum and current hit pointsare both increased by it.This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point, and the change to your and the homunculusâ€™s hit points endswhen you finish your next long rest.The reduction to your hit point maximum canâ€™t be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculusâ€™s death. You can have onlyone homunculusat a time.If you cast thisspell whileyour homunculus lives, the spell fails.
unfortunately, wizards have a lot of additional spells
the ones from additional sources take a hot minute tho
yea but it takes like 0 time to add in compendium spells
you get some of it
and depending on your int
like you just hold it and think of what you want to know
anyone rn can study the bestiary
like 5 minutes
Raise your eyes to the skies and observe! Today our world's destruction has been averted in defiance of our very makers! 

Algalon the Observer, herald of the titans, has been defeated by our brave comrades in the depths of the titan city of Ulduar. 

Algalon was sent here to judge the fate of our world. He found a planet whose races had deviated from the titans' blueprints. A planet where not everything had gone according to plan.

Cold logic deemed our world not worth saving. Cold logic, however, does not account for the power of free will. It's up to each of us to prove this is a world worth saving. That our lives... our lives are worth living.
CITIZENS OF DALARAN?
you just hung up
no
everyone gets 1500xp and he got 500
because gemi heroically killed the fire giant and secured your indoor heatin

you do know that marble and masterwork woodcraft is expensive right
t a b l e s
and tables and beds
eligius only bought furniture

Quick question. Is there any level of creepy horror you guys aren't ok with 
Tilt my life in two pieces

Explain 
Wtf is that meme
Once known as the Favonia Estate, the Borealum is a grand keep overlooking a gated community. Staffed by roughly two hundred servants, the keep is immense and well maintained. Though the previous family took much of the art and furniture when they left, the Borealum has since been renovated with ornate furniture in a motif of marble. The original stained glass windows and murals of heroic battles still lend a sense of beauty to the keep even without the presence of additional artworks. For how large the keep is, the majority of the Borealum is the hedges, orchard, and forest. Even within the keep proper greenery is abundant. Various gardens and courtyards can be found scattered inside, decorated with statue-stands and fountains. The grand hall seats upwards of a hundred guests at the main table and hundreds more at the tables beneath. Though common logic would dictate that the stone keep lacks warmth in winter, a fire giant's heart is traditionally kept within the central heating system to warm the shining redstone floors year-round. As any proper keep does, the Borealum includes a chapel-room devoted to the Cult of Moments, as well as hidden enclaves for holding statues of the gods safely tucked out of sight. The central courtyard holds the training grounds for the guards, the smiths' forges, the stables, and the houndmaster's den. The forest east of the keep can be stocked with game captured in the northern woods to be hunted for sport. The orchard grows year round if a druid is paid to maintain the enchantments within. South of the keep lies the towering Arcaneum. To those with the eye for such things, it is evident the spire lies on top of a minor ley-line. Abandoned long before even the Favonias, the Arcaneum has fallen to a sad state of disrepair. And lastly, the track for horses lies on the property, though unused thus far.

First of Needfest, in the Year 722 of the Forty-Second Cycle
but id prefer to know if were eating babies here by like tomorrow so I can finish it if I have to

like a long dungeon crawl
I mean either you like it or you dont
that's metal af
Undercommon

Spoken: Creatures of the Underdark tread lightly, never knowing which shadow may spell their doom. Their language is shaped by this caution. Undercommon is only ever spoken as a whisper. There is only one word that breaks this rule: &quot;HELP.&quot; Denizens fill the darkness with screeching cries for aid. But travelers should beware: not all cries for help come from the helpless.

Written: Undercommon is mostly written on stalagmites. When given the time, creatures will write different messages on each side of a stalagmite. Each message will hold contradictory information. Only one message tells the truth. This method of writing serves as a hidden signpost for friends and allies: in case you are lost in the Underdark, just follow the truth to find safety.
theyre thiccc
nah theyre just big because theyre dragonkin
I'm surprised nobody wondered about the abnormal size of the iridescents
but besides them you haven't met dragonborn in the empire
yea the iridescents are a special legion made of dragonborn
yea. the big hint being theyre all 7+ ft tall
put a helmet on him and he looks human if you take the tail off
they can have shorter snouts
some dont
some have the full snout
some dont
some have tails
they vary
always
the iridescents are in full plate
and hes only like 5ft 7
zayns obv human
one of those was right
if anyone remembers
I did a bit of hissing when I spoke as one
again think about physicality
and it wasn't immediately obvious
you never bothered to check
 Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
I said you've met multiple
and nah
outlander
ill sy
no if you talk to someone and theyre obviously not human
really think about the physicality of dragonborn
ive given hints at it
you might remember
think for a bit
very briefly
but briefly
I guess you technically have spoken to one
you've been spoken to
spoken to
some of your servants aren't human
sometimes its just not pertinent
yea I mean I don't mention the race of everyone you've ever met
sometimes it just isn't I guess
 Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
its not always obvious
you've met multiple
you have
721, colorized
letho turning in the heads to the Hand
Enumerated it's not as high as I thought 
Btw retroactively I said 8-12 cr. Not 10-15
&quot;mom get out of my room reeeeee&quot;

go for it
i mean
except its not just empty black beneath
yea i mean yew's arm is like that. the twisting and warping of skin thats also changed color
so...thats how i learned to not get a tattoo i guess
then the guy asked if i was in a gang
i tried to get a tattoo in Taiwan over the summer
maybe when I'm older
nah
it might be gay to have one as a guy
but theyre for women
like full body traditional tattoos are ok i guess
<ss type="smile">:)</ss>
its like being black. it tells people youre a sketchy dude
anything thats not small or hiding under clothing
tattoos really hurt that
i want to get laid there though
where I go for a quarter of the year
in asia
or a mobster
you cant get hired for shit cause youre either a pornstar
if youre a tattooed dude
listen thats just how it is in asia
or youre in porn
the only reason guys get tattoos is to show youre part of the mob
its still pretty gay though
of any kind
not dudes
idk. I think that kind of tattoo is for rich women
is for women
the kind I'm thinking of
wtf
I'm not a woman
so I'm torn
but I do really like elaborate tattoos
same
tbh
picture girl looks like a typical half white half Mexican girl
exactly that type
theres a like 4 foot 9 Korean girl who I made a board game with
yea I know the type
are slutty
lip piercings
lmao
we all know edgy art people ulu
crawling in my skin
its pretty disturbing to watch

Edited previous message: yea but the neck up to the cheek<e_m ts="1518289641" ts_ms="1518289641311" a="live:eric_3116" t="61"/>
yea but the neck up to the cheeck

aight at least that's good
you ok?
wtf
dicey
things are gonna get
^
i can agree with that
its interesting
i do kind of like how you can mark your home and notable shops tho
so I guess we just need milo and miles vote
because ones easier but I like the looks of the other lol
just thoughts
I don't really have a vote
its &quot;the stores in the king's district by the inn with the hare on it&quot;
its not &quot;The store is on 45th and Georgia&quot;
which is kind of a roleplay thing if youre pretending you think like a medieval person
the other is styled but you don't know exactly where things are
but unrealistic considering maps of cities didn't really exist in this form
ones definitely more detailed
theres arguments for both
its just less visually interesting
it takes a tenth the time
what are your opinions on this kind of map vs the normal ones
other note
that's impressive
his arms are almost an anorexic dudes size
hes got big Halfling muscles
look at that halfing

the crystals on the bottom are decent sized
id say the staff is a solid 7 feet
the rose is pretty big
yea. theres a reason it prefers to be bonded to elves
so the barbs are a bit under a foot wide
the whole sword is 5ft
but theres overlap between the blade and hilt though
the whole thing is about 5ft
just the blade is probably pushing 4ft
and much harder to wield properly
its much longer than a typical longsword
actually that's kind of what it is
but its also a really deadly projectile
so most of the time the blade is for slashing
the barb keeps them inside the target
the 7 charge effect launches the blade clones in a straight line
of a sword that could be launched forward
like if there were mirages
if you have the magic to launch it
its basically one giant barbed arrow
also it makes it able to act as a projectile
cause elves are much stronger than humans
I don't think its a magical effect I think the blade just stabs all the way through
most of the time
which you are going to stab all the way through
so the barbs are just there because its a blade forged to slay titanic monsters and essentially demigods
or leather
but it also makes it easier to catch the blade on chain
which isn't an issue for an enchanted sword
the reason they didn't make serrated blades is cause the edge dulls much faster as you hit armored objects
they mostly point back
also those are basically barbs on the sword
if youre just trying to slash you want a smooth edge
like if youre gonna saw back and forth
serrations are for cutting
if you stab and try to pull out its harder
its the same with a serrated blade
its much harder to pull out
no when you shoot someone with a barbed arrow
yea kind of? its only serrated at the base cause otherwise how would you pull it out of people
Nierya 
cmon
shitpost in /all
tbh
yea 2 weeks is the fairest of those
yea but at least its not perma
but apparently riots minimum on racism is 2 weeks
for like 3 days
you definitely deserved a ban
no
chasing the fish he caught
and a seal crawled onto the beach
I saw a gif of a guy fishing
.
or add all the spells from the wiki
after
yea
also you can choose to add just the roll20 spells
you get double
that's what I thought
yea
15
well 2 then
oh
so that's 3 3rd level 3 second 4 first x 2 x 3 days
yea
oh yea the 3 days pass so you get 3 charges on both artifacts
we cant have whole foods 3.0
no pulling a whole foods
at 3
sounds good
that's the plan
and weekends basically all day
so basically all the time cause I don't do things
I'm free after 4 on Monday, after 7 on Tuesday, after 4 weds, 2 on thurs, all day fri
I'm ready whenever youre all free again so lets find sometime this week
mars nigga where you at
we all here?
anyone cant do tomorrow at 230
why are you not in call
I'm gonna go kill myself now
ok so I think the campaign is done
and set up a custom class
you can go to the gear section
ok
well yea no its not
oh
its the casting modifier for like 3 classes
that's it
like be a character that can at least understand what magic IS
just don't be too dumb
you don't have to be
like there are hired court mages that sit around all day working on enchantments for the crown
but people will do it
it will be difficult to do
the big difference magically is that enchanting objects will be a common thing
instead of try to fight them directly
you'll have to outwit them if you want to maneuver against them
are very well versed in magic and utilize it effectively
the higher powers, aka a decent amount of people you'd interact with
like instead of spy networks you have wards on the castle to prevent assassins
but if society evolved to get there by using magic
right at the height of the 1300s if were going by tech
yea
its really political
it fights right into this setting
oh fuck yea that's perfect
yea
I can do 4 tho
rn the consensus is 3
or would you prefer the typical level 1 start as nobody
About the characters, would you guys be interested in starting at level 8. Come up with some backstory that justifies this and jump right into the middle of the politics and being-a-somebody
Michael?
but yea i wouldn't mention it in front of jett
and milo knows
well david and diego aren't already
everyone else is in on it
i mean youre basically just keeping it from jett
i need an answer from parsa and Michael tho
if hes down
and miles
so I'm down to run it with just you guys
real talk tho rn these are the people i think would be the best players
cause fuck class
i skipped classes to write it earlier lmao
theres literally a list of phrases common to each kingdom of humans
because I take a long time to write lol
its not gonna be as regular a thing as tandoori
or we postpone
I or someone else would play their chracter
well yea the plan was doing shorter quests but if someone on a quest cant make the next session
etc
elves have their own
dwarves only use gold and gems
as human currency
with copper silver gold
its also a lot more by the books on gold
yes
I implied
but less magical items than tandoori
rn its pretty high fantasy
and wrote a ton of lore and setting already
I made the map
you guys decide
with 3-4
or it could just be a smaller one
up to 4 cause if we have 5 then we'd just be doing eluras
but not everyone does it every week
so like everyone has a character
run when not everyone can make it
it could be a variable campaign
actually so about the idea
bless
its done
lol
can you hear us
yo
might as well
atlas didn't answer so
I guess we'll wait for you
&quot;im retarded&quot; - mars
Hurry up and get home
You have the big gay
Nobody cares
I just got home
I'm Gucci any time, ya Boi has a 5 day weekend 
do it now
yes kill him
you can try
but leon got drugged and forgot that
Ahn killed 2 dudes
ready?
l m a o
fuckin double tap your bitch ass
ill take the consent
I own a crossbow
for real
and actually shoot you
mars ill go to your house
is wrong with you
the fuck
nah im in a raid rn until 8
8
usual time
What time you guys trying
atlas and grim, you guys good
y e s
with kai's forces north of the Havanth Mountains and the Alkathar forces holding them in Karan's Divide
which has currently pushed down past mereleth's princedom and is now in the unclaimed princedom
and a map of the current battlefront
1 quote from vividal's library that Asan would have heard or read in his time at the order
2 new things
etc
back to king sachiel to see how you can help the war
far away and hide
north to hunt and kill kai
where were you guys planning to go with nierya next
also parsa is moving apartments tomorrow anyway
yea. its not a good time for most of us it seems
so it would be a struggle for me regardless
lmao I was gonna say I have a thicc assignment due Monday and a party going on at my apartment tomorrow night anyway
Im not feeling to hot today either
and multiattack
yew just had a lot of spells he never used
no that was letho
dead but gloriously so
and wiping almost all life off an entire continent in the aftermath
causing the downfall of humankind's greatest empire
yea but it was spectacular. ruining the coronation of a demigod and downing thousands, and hundreds of angels before being taken out
v a l u e t o w n
it was actually a psychic sword-mage. max use of nierya's magic and swings, while also being a glass cannon that benefits off being continuously revived by her
what even was Yew's class
It was a perfect match
Yew was psychotic with a desire to dominate as well as an arcane caster with sword skills
as both a mage and a fighter
he was one of the wielders most in sync with nierya
nierya is very willing
and if you guys want yew to come back
so it may be difficult to call her back regardless
well shes one of the few elves to ever escape the cycle of rebirth
otherwise you can go to king sachiel and ask his opinion on whats best for alkathar
well leon has information on Iouns Champion who is a suitable target for nierya
again, nierya will only bring back someone with the Elder Blood
even then she wasn't elven
but she is now
how can she be worthy
bitch wtf shes drow
oh
no I don't get the 1000 items reference
I don't even understand that reference
again, they have to be a person Nierya would find worthy
her recommendations are still Lilith, Pravaal, Lyreth, and Gemi
But if you don't want to take nierya's advice, think of others
that's...not the big concern
but youd make nierya very happy letting Lilith back
well unless you have better ideas
Of all the wielders, she was her favorite
Nierya liked her
and leaves one for gemi
Pravaal, Lilith, Lyreth makes 3
personally, she wants to bring back her previous wielders
but he cant force nierya
He can suggest people
unless you prove otherwise you'll have it
Ultimately all benefits are neirya's to command and she finds you three worthy enough having had you free her
Nierya is a supremacist though so she will only raise someone with the Elder Blood, aka elves, otherwise youre on your own if you want to raise someone dead for the job
So you should come up with others, or go to the King and have him nominate generals for it
Also, white eyes says that since nierya can ascend 7, you should decide upon 4 more to gain her blessing. Since King Sachiel is going to need them to turn the war anyway, seeing as 4 won't be enough especially when they have no command or armies
yes but you did it
Because you told said horror about how much she means to you
You also got him stabbed in the first place
his token is so good
what he would have been after saving his people and conquering the primordial frost
kinda. king Elin is his finished arc
lmao
you forgot the fire druid who hates dragons
you fuckin idiot
yea
white eye's exposition on Izoldi for Valyra
you were just helping cio who did
nobody else took his deal
also mars got his item beforehand
tbf he did return it in a way
atlas can you hear us
because that's always a valid concern with you
we thought you died
and die
did he spill the spaghet on his head
where tf did mars go
unless youre alqaeda
if youre in the normal martial arts range
doesn't even work
throwing dynamite
that's some bitch shit boi
lmao
you couldn't even take dodgeball at scouts
youd lose against mars irl
tbh
I mean im down to just start
wanna start then?
aight
I'm ready just gotta save spooderman
so far everyone but grim is up
but yea if you guys want to start im down
yea she is
if we want to start soon
im ready
that's rough lul
aight
is that like a one time thing
im good
so his human half went to the gardens while his divine half remained in the tomb
it literally states he gives up the divine part of his soul by the end
gemi was just some dude
she was literally the avatar of a celestial
to get away from you
only for a little bit
yea gemi had a fucking adventure after yall idiots died or went to the gardens
except like one
its actually all gemi
theres a lot of GEMI CHANCE on there
hey parsa
I thought it wouldn't go as far as it did
I mean I'm blaming myself
Mb
I had a date go late
15
I'm on ghee walk back
Getting on
Ok I'm home
Oh ya you passed out mid sesh lol
Nvm I'm on the way. Should only be 20 late
That'll teach you
I might be an hour late. Traffic back might suck
Reeee
Tasted like it. Also mars. Space jam 2 when
I can deal with traps if it means not driving to Pasadena for Kobe 
I'd be down if anyone showed up
We playing today?
Mars idk how you hate this place. This hot pot place has Kobe beef belly and the plaza has pressed juice and shit. So much better than la
so not on the weekend
nah. earliest I can do is monday
hmm
oh wait. im going to san Francisco this weekend...
so, usual time then
wtf
I cant see that message from mars on my comp but I can on my phone
What
so next week ill be prepared well
its aight. I played wow all week and had not as much as usual
you fucking piece of shit mars wth
fuck off and just join
mars wtf are you doing in chat
ready?
Alarms are buzzkills
isn't that what alarms are for
didn't draw anything either lul
played bfa all week so I have to prep it tho
im good for tomorrow
I'm good
Itâ€™s only like 13$
See. Wagyu is a common thing here
mars where are you
&quot;exactly 830&quot;
well mars are you here
Naw you have nothing that spots an image
Integrated or seperate
Yea you need some form of gpu
Mars. Promptly 830
And don't oc it if you don't know how to not fry jt
Just don't spark your cpu and it will be good
Yea don't get the replacement plan
Actually thatâ€™s not bad cause I can go farther to grab dinner then
you bitch
paying for windows LUL
Download it and 12 key off a sketchy website
^
Tbh pirate windows lol
What do you mean
It's just a space filler between your cpu and heat sink
that's not what thermal compound is
Yea for your cpu
I used it
lul
yea put out on the bed
Just don't put out on the floor you're good
if its an issue you can just get a dehumidifier
Yea
but its fine unless &quot;very damp&quot; is condensing
that's not ideal
As long as it's not straight water
the only suboptimal place is like right in the sun
Ryzen beat Intels this Gen imo
basement pc should be fine unless you have leaks or smth
The website
I think I only have 2
And I think it's pc builder or buildapc
idk about fan slots lol
2700x is pretty beefy too
as long as it fits you know
case doesn't really matter. I think I just took one from my garage
its like a powerful engine with old wheels
its meant to run with an i7
youd be wasting a lot of the 1080 potential with it
id check on that
theres a site that I don't remember that tells you part compatibilities
yea that's really good
so if you stall a bit longer you get more value
like the 1070 is almost a 980ti
id wait for the 1170 cause itll be equal to the 1080 roughly
nah theyre always overpriced at the start
they can work together but different parts optimize more
and compatibility with the motherboard
I have no idea about that. youll want to check compatibility with the 1080 because its a lot newer than those old cpus
if you scale anything down it should be graphics card and cpu
ram is cheap too
that's too little
nah
so yours is easily enough
I have a 6 core i7, 1080, 32gb ram and its def overkill
you probably don't need ridiculous specs tho
and all the new stuff
idk. I bought brand new everything
ye
that's probably morally good
by a long shot
youre the closest to good
you've fucked up so much we cant tell anymore
youre like the boy who cried wolf
the last 2 weeks you've been a fuckboi. don't pull that shit again
I swear mars
Flakes are lame and yea wasn't he the paly
I haven't missed one ðŸ‘
I wonder if that one guy is ever going to play again
the version with red in the hair looks weird to me
because its the most finished
yes
oh also if anyone wants the finished art that's on the Daughter's bio
except its actually easier if you answer thursdays
yea
lol. I usually ask on thursdays
mars....
I'm good with it
same time as usual?
It is impossible to reconcile the spelling â€œgeasâ€ and the pronunciation /geSH/
fuckin hurry it up there mars
lets start
well ok
ur mom gay
mars stfu and go home
lol. maybe if you switch to worshiping asmodeus
they cant bend like mortals or comprehend different opinions because theyre convinced theyre always right
even the angels are like that. beings of a plane of existence are hard wired to that alignment and that way of thought. same as how demons can only choose to destroy
depends on the god but none see things in shades of grey. something is either absolutely right or its wrong. so for most gods, becoming a devil is wrong and no matter the reason they wouldn't support it
Orphan souls = money its worth
youd have to have a very good reason for your diety to continue providing you power
as a cleric? probably not
Perfect place for all these orphan souls
and the cycle continues
then they contract souls of others to rise in power
yes. theyre tortured until they break and become devils
them
weaker ones, bound to the
devils turn souls they own into other devils
white eyes could always use more souls and more servants
well youre free to do it
see I didn't realize that
ah
youd have to find someone to break that if you wanted to keep the souls
well its not too late. although the device is enchanted so that the souls are brought right to his little corner of the hells
you capture them, they belong to him, he gives you something extra
that was the deal white eyes was offering
the dc for them is Charisma 17 to escape
mars was given a soul catcher. as long as he uses it within a minute of death it should work
so he cant attack people
well I wont give him the character sheet
so lets just do that. he said you can be cio for now
he said to start at 8
yea. I just don't like restaurants without a cohesive menu so
they just try to be trendy
idk if they are
pretty much
its just a normal restaurant
where they have a non-cohesive menu made of whatever is in season
nothing. that whole area is just &quot;fresh&quot; food
dumb trendy stuff
or I guess its mushroom toast there but you know what I mean
hah. aight whatever hurry your ass up and enjoy your gay ass avocado toast millennial food
and was it the really gay tall Mexican guy
did they seat you yet
that's fucking hilarious
lmao. holy shit I cant believe youre going there
for butchers daughter?
and its just as good
butchers daughter is right next to it
its good but its not worth the wait
fuck waiting for that place
hhahaha wait I was just there
ik its not a fancy French dinner
how are you at dinner for 2 hours
yea. mars just hurry it up and be back by 8
I'm d to start but Idk what's going on with mars
you ape
you said you have no work
agreed to it
you fucking
mars
but otherwise, deals are final
if you want more from him
well theres always soul collection
and help is something in short supply
it just helps you
whats with all this over a ring
9/10
if that was a threat. it was solid
yikes
hahhaa
well. I think you gave it to valyra anyway
devils aren't known for ethical trade practices
I'm sure white eyes is a nice guy don't worry
theres no clause for buyers remorse
well, you accepted it
Yup
Sweet
so lets do that
at the normal time
nvm atlas said he can make it
I can do whenever since im just drawing
aight. what time are you guys thinking then
Yea I'm down with it
unless grims ok with it too
nah lets do the usual time
yea ik. only with jett
lul
yea. then again maybe silence means theyre ok with the usual
So us 3 pcs this time?
g -&gt; f, a -&gt; a, y -&gt; t. interesting cypher there mars
.
mars is this your experiment
same time this week?
there was
old one was boring imo
repainted nierya
yea. nobody wanted the staff of frost
nobody needs a staff anyway
kys
nierya
fetch quest
aight mars heres what happened
monkaHMM
eladrin artifacts vs white eye's treasure
literally burned 7 spell slots to miss 7 attacks
green = really high damage but mars cant land hits
Mister Belmont you coming?
kk
lets do this
well
ye
Ironic
Go touch uti and Milo in your gay ass orgy
Fuck outta here
You're a fucking idiot mars
My PTSD is triggering
Stop. Get out jett 
It's accurate 
Parsas charisma is like a -3
its a staff of thunder and lightning
anyway yea
only cause nobody else wanted it haha
I believe others are at work then which is why we do the usual time 
scheduling was aids this time
its better nobody sees the old one
ik
and I don't have to keep using the my hero academia guy lol
so I flat shaded the new kai picture
Wtf is your schedule. Let's just stick to tomorrow. I kind of like it as a consistent thing anyway
Good with me 
Is anyone able to do 8 today. Otherwise same time tomorrow
yea. im thinking either sat without mars or Friday if possible
Sun*
I can't so sat cause I have work a early mon
but for real mars try to get out of that shift
well like always I can do Fridays too
we'll see when we get more responses
I mean if were good for sunday that's fine too
and were good lul
mars just get out of that shift by sat
than skip
id rather do it without mars
sunday is worse for the east coasters cause they cant go late
well fuck you get out of that shift so we can do sat
no matter how obvious it is
they cant call you out on it
again
its foolproof
if they call you out then they look like the assholes
and you need to see your shrink at that time
mars claim youre traumatized from that shootout
Good here
we all good for same time this week/
like adowible wittle girls
you all actually have morals
I think the secret is
you could've left that one crippled
And then stuffed him in my bag just didn't last long
I did
due to being sealed away or another reason
most will find them but its possible some wont
same as the demons
the souls that got released were searching for their vessels
ready?
no
mars are you home yet
yea
Sounds good 
so far so good for same time, 8pm tmrw
Get hit by a car
I like my sleep
Hey man. Get hit by a car. Pull a jett
So far it looks like same time as last week so I guess that's what's happening
I mean I don't. I'm going to sleep
Which is doubly retarded
Business
Yea like out in the country
He's actually retarded
Mars he goes to private Christian college
He's like barely upper middle class and thinks he's refined as fuck about cars and shit lol
Yea. It was gay as hell too 
Yea you remember when Michael was getting heated about engines and then like welfare or smth
Half the time I just take the opposite stance for fun
Also again idc what you broke idiots think when you spam that other chat with politics shit
I didn't lol. Milo did and I never switched that shit back
By changing Skype names
So I don't need to roast people passive aggressively
Mars you have to understand I don't care about any of your opinions
Like Parsa is SAME cause he's always salty
I still have everyone as variations on the word same
Boy let's not talk about Skype names 
Not learn about his life
All I want to do is harass mars
Yea c'mon 
a. youre retarded. b. don't be and just leave at 630 4head
well get a shift cover then
come in to camp
real fast
I can get you sick
hey mars
lol...
so like I can do 1,2,3
so type 1 if you can do Friday at like 8pm pst, 2 for sat at 8pm, 3 for sunday at 6pst
otherwise, fri or sun
but yea same time or later if we do sat. cant do earlier
lol. unless youre a phd student at usc i don't think its the same one tho
Thats literally what I'm doing, wot
i have a bbq going on so im probably not out of that until like 8
Same would work for me
id rather do Friday/sunday
unless its late
me too probably
If we decide to do it again on Saturday then I can't make it.
Yee
si
ready?
I just gotta choose spells, but my last wizard was lvl4 so I am gonna copy him
I was joking
I should probably make a character huh
I mean demons speak it
sylvan too
elvish in alkathar
1:45
How many hrs left?
his dick is probably shriveled anyway
also he's 130 years old
stat buy gets you to 15 15 14 10 8 8
by a bit
thats above average
If he gets a 17 I want one
That's above average
what are your stats
by killing his dad
so the Lady is paying you to enable him to run for king
meaning it falls to the King's eldest who is in most people's view, worse
but he doesn't allow his son to bid
since the current one is &quot;dying&quot;
Rinasel wants his son to bid for king
mars this is why everyone is under average health
normal way. either pick average or roll your hit die
:thinking:
people still die/go unconscious
and yet
the dot inside ALV
Amnenfall is the capital of his lands
we'll see at the start what Amnenfall is like
which was a shithole mostly run by a thieves guild
you were in falconrest last session
I guess that's for you to decide
and 5000 &gt; 1500
but if you kill/silence/change the mind of High-Prince Tirael you'll get paid 5000
plate is 1500 lol
for bringing the crystal back
no im pretty sure you got 500 total
we'll say he gets that too
100 each?
whatd you get paid for the last job
default stuff but level 4
by loli futa trap
imagine getting killed
was so fucking dank
dude that shit
my mental after talking to him
you know what is broke tho
goddamn do i feel broke
im sitting around in a handwoven silk robe waiting for a sushi delivery
imagine that
he called me poor
i got in a lobby with him and francisco
deserves it
but yea dual
triHard7
i mean
think about the irony of that statement
mars
why didn't i just get that back
i forgot i had loli futa trap
fuck
and just flame him hard
that, or add dualtwin
Jinx Yuri Hentai
well if anyone wants to add me
yea
banned
fuckin 2-20 and you don't ff
when its clearly lost
is not ffing
i feel like the real perma offense
so now i just play on a gold smurf and say whatever i want
idk why its punishable
you can just mute
being flamed online isn't like being bullied
getting reported is retarded
What?! I was permabanned
This game fucking sucks.
but it wasn't a perma it was just like a 2 week
except to someone else
do the same shit
lmao. we had a friend hieu
I don't blame him
like 2 kills and hes done
My account got permabanned for calling Darshan a nigger once
hes a tilter
Yeah he's fell off
hes like plat-low diamond
ik. i played with him recently
I'm not tobias
I was a gp one trick once upon a time
hell yea. im tryna be a jinx one trick now tho
I'm trying to learn mid on my smurf atm
I'm a jg main too
that's like a years worth of chat but its somewhere in there lol
aight
i just play jg
im too boosted to lane
so its a normal sheet again
and cancel that shit
go to the second tab where its &quot;charactermancer&quot;
also atlas if you found the character sheet
just totally fucking gay

I'm too good to play with y'all
So y'all don't decide to start and I'm balls deep or taking a dump or playing league
Tbh I don't care I just want a time
Nvm I can make earlier if majority wants it
it seems like it anyway
well apparently 8 is a better time for most?
Jesus
We aren't playing till 8pst?
that or get on league
you should go mob him there and tell his bitch ass to go home
mars wheres parsa work

I'm good with either.
But for consistency we should do same time as last week I think
I'm ok for sat or later today
9pm pst yeah?
9pm pst yeah?
and there was a brief thing in the kingdom description about Tirael. He's old at 130 years of age and staunchly supports the Alkathar princedom as the royal line. Rinasel and many others want Sachiel as the next king because they believe him a better man than Hariel, the King's son. So they need Tirael out of the way. And the faction supporting Sachiel is led by the king's younger son, Anariel.
lady rinasel acquired 2 new mercenaries, ciocie and valyra, who joined the band. then they were paid to go retrieve a crystal from bandits. after a stint with a phase spider they hunted down the bandits and killed them all except the leader who traded the crystal for his life and some gold. at one point the barbarian beheaded a prisoner. and then upon returning they accepted the new job which is to kill or change the opinion of the aged Lord Tirael, high-prince of the Alvath territory, in order to allow tirael's son Sachiel to bid for king.
What did I miss though?
I'm sorry mates, the girl and I had a bunch of stuff planned for the summer because she is having surgery soon and won't be able to do much.  Next weekend I will be playing even if I have to haul my computer and screen to another state!
I'm on the drive home. Ten minutes 
we'll fill you in on what happens I guess
damn. next time then
Pst?
I can't swing tonight, next Saturday will be good but apparently I had something planned for this one prior to dnd group
yea afaik were good for 8pm
Yo can I get confirmation lol
So we're doing 8pm pst?
yea definitely not a morning person either
Aight cool I'm not a morning guy just had to clarify
Who's awake at 8am
Nah PM 
Am?
8 is aight
Level 4. And 6:00 hopefully
Base
Sounds great
So for the mercenary angle you'd all have some familiarity as co-workers under the estate of the reclusive lady rinasel, deep in the nobles district of falconrest. Though you haven't seen her, as all matters are dealt with through her head of staff, Leigran. Most of it has been simple guarding and escort jobs, simple and with fair pay. But now, the high lady has returned to the estate and it runs abuzz with speculation and anticipation.
That's what I did last time but I wasn't sure you'd be down to clown
I'm svirfneblin
Dope
ye
Could I be a svirfneblin gnome if I so chose?
This sat and next sat might be tricky for me but I will see what I can do
It could work for my guy
What time?
Hmm saturday
Find a nice inbetween
Not this loud
I saw the word Saturday
God damn 69 unread messages
That would work for my barb, could've gotten caught up in them on my exploration or something
So for the new characters. How would you feel being introduced as a band of mercenaries. 
Yea I'm just fucking with Parsa. I'm sure he's secretly gay for Milo
<ss type="smile">:)</ss>

he just didn't want to rp anything serious

Fuck LA man lol
Yea i used to get stuck in LA traffic all the way in corona
Oh they didn't have them where I was in socal
Thats sick
Look them up
It's a motor scooter you rent and leave wherever
Tf is a bird
Plus you don't get id when you go into a store on one cause you look like an elderly person
Dude they're fun
Thought
Shits faster than I though
Nvm I'm home. I took a bird lol
I'm walking home rn. Should be back in time

530 should work for me

I don't do bitter
Nah I'm gonna get hard soda or smth
I do want that drink
Let's say 530
Mars you know the big ass one. The one that looks like you'd find it in your neighborhood
Fake id. And sketchy stores by my place
I need a drink after too 
I'm home at like 5. C'mon bruh
Currently imitating a Lady Yvonne and in audience with the prince himself
We can also discuss how everyone will get to know each other. RN the two are in the capitol of the aleese princedom, in falconrest. 
That sounds good to me
I cannot do this Saturday, sunday is fine.  Beyond this week Saturday will work for me though
They're retard stoned. Not the fun kind
I can do Sat. The only reason I couldn't was Milo and Philip are gonna go smoke on the beach but tbh I can miss that
As long as it's not too late Thurs is coo
She was a gnome
Gnome
I was looking to play a gnome wizard, but as I told mars I have been playing a long ass time and have a billion and one character concepts that could work
I was eating lunch and the games, sorry I'm late
Dragonborn is fine. You can decide how draconian. Between just horns/scales to full tail and Dragon head
my messages weren't sending :l
I don't mind being an outcast, I was kinda lookin to go for that like a guy that left home but doesn't know how fucked the world is. he just saw a glimpse of some cool shit and ran

Depends. They've met a Lord Risthart who has Dragon horns but no other features. Yet to meet a full one tho. But they exist, just scarcely
You only get by as a drow because you always wear a veil and fully cover
They're the historic enemy, only better than elves
It's not great being a goliath in alkathar. Especially the large ones
Yea. The only path to being a warrior there is being one of the old-blood, the large goliaths. That or being chosen at birth to be one of the dawnbringers, wielders of the oathblades and dawnplate
Cause alkathar is competitive as fuck. The only thing keeping the princes at peace is the diligence of the throne
Hahaha yes. He could also feel the philosophy of battle in all aspects of life is better suited to him than the pursuit of peace and stability
At least alkathar has cities, even if their grandest are built on the ruins of elves
I can roll with it. They still live in mostly huts and small houses
Yea that's good
so what about a human barb that is going through a phase and that's why he left all that behind. He's still a barb but maybe he saw somethin that made him think there are better things than tribes and wastes so he left to go find adventure like a roided up teenager
Giants, burrow worms, dragons, and other large creatures grow there, hunting the people
It's hard in the north though. Ancient spirits wander the frozen tundra after the Dynasty cleansed their bodies millennia ago. The land is wild and carelessness can find you stuck in the feywild
And they revere their shaman and druids, while mostly rejecting nobility outside of chiefs
Most goliaths there aren't actually the titanic ones. Many are human sized just grey skinned. They still live in tribes but keep mostly peace among themselves
what <ss type="movember">(movember)</ss> 
Surprisingly they worship the Daughter. Crafts, peace, family, stability
Just like second class citizens or monks
It's mostly goliath tribes but there are humans too 
what <ss type="movember">(movember)</ss> 
Cough. Only one who died while divine. Cough
For sure. A lot of combats are deadly so both are solid picks
Yes cause last time I tried to paste but Skype didn't recognize html symbols
Idc either way
Rolling tends to be higher so far
These are my shitty train notes but it should be enough to help with background or lore
Like the Regiment of law
I like the group
Justicar are more special forces. Each princedom maintains its own police
Whoever devised that is a sick fuck
Which, Parsa can you post it here
I have really shitty notes on the 12 princes and a crude map of territory
Reading through lore and find magic users get kidnapped, was planning a wizard.  Good thing he's illusion focused
But being young and independent of magic for the most part, humans dominate the third age. The majority of artifacts like oathblades and dawnplate are under human names 
And ever since, magic has grown far rarer, races still in the material plane are declining in strength, and what gods once walked the planet have abandoned it
Yea. Our last campaign ended with a battle of gods against an eladrin traitor which marked the end of the second age
And no elves in alkathar, after being driven out. 
Although eladrin aren't the src ones. They're true immortal, reborn or enduring since the birth of the world
Gnomes. Anything from SRC
Rangers are like druids. They get it from nature
Yea you go for it a bit. I don't want to spoil stuff accidentally
Thanks. It's one of the better pieces for sure
It's divided into 12 princedoms but they all primarily worship the Son, a deity of masculinity, competition, war, and victory
We're currently in the center of the center continent, between the desert and the large lake on top of the midsection, in a kingdom named alkathar
Speaking of. This is the world map
I'm Eric. I dm and do the art
Mars do you have my world map. I don't have it on my phone but I want to post it
Perfect
That title...
