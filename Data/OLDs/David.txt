one of my roommates is sick so there may be a self-quarantine in my future
that's the government's policy for now
if you don't test anyone, the number of cases looks low for a while
a quarantine would be really difficult because the size of the outbreaks is unclear
the US has a much lower rate of testing than most other countries
I think there are at max 4-6 months of disruption (shortages, quarantines, cancelled events, etc.) then things go back to normal except the economy is now shittier and Covid-19 becomes a seasonal illness after attempts to contain the outbreak fail<e_m a="david.grothe3" ts_ms="1583985628486" ts="1583985628" t="61"></e_m>

If there's a soul, wouldn't it be more complicated than that? Doesn't a soul bring right and wrong into it?
Yeah, it seems like even Neanderthals cared for people with broken bones and shit
It's kind of a fucked up thing. Looking at things on an individual level is pretty limited, but looking at things on a cosmic scale is also kind dumb because humans experience is not on that scale
I do think that humans don't make decisions based on 100% rationality and that the idea that the weak should just be left to die has never really verifiably been a majority view by any group in history
But any meaning anyone's life has is a meaning they have given it
The idea that things have meaning can help society function though, so it can be beneficial
I think that since meaning is a human concept, nothing has an inherent meaning that hasn't been attributed to it by a person or people
I don't have any special knowledge or perspective that would lend my views more validity than anyone else's
They're pretty irrelevant honestly

the classic
The quote was included in there.
My roommate recommended me a book partially about this topic and the first chapter seems to be about how one of the effects of capitalism is the view of everything from the perspective of exchange value.
The important part was &quot;it has resolved personal worth into exchange value,&quot; because that was part of the discussion yall had earlier.
This quote is in fact from the Communist Manifesto.
xd
&quot;[Capital] has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious
fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism,
in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved
personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the
numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that
single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade. In one word,
for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it
has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.&quot;
I try.
I kinda felt like we needed more difficult to read discussion about society but I settled for shitposting.

This week's episode was better than last week's.
Waluigi is the ultimate example of the individual shaped by the signifier. Waluigi is a man seen only in mirror images; lost in a hall of mirrors he is a reflection of a reflection of a reflection. You start with Mario -- the wholesome all Italian plumbing superman, you reflect him to create Luigi -- the same thing but slightly less. You invert Mario to create Wario -- Mario turned septic and libertarian -- then you reflect the inversion in the reflection: you create a being who can only exist in reference to others. Waluigi is the true nowhere man, without the other characters he reflects, inverts and parodies he has no reason to exist. Waluigi's identity only comes from what and who he isn't -- without a wider frame of reference he is nothing. He is not his own man. In a world where our identities are shaped by our warped relationships to brands and commerce we are all Waluigi.

I have deduced the reason behind why and how this video is cursed. For one, this girl is highly attractive and her cosplay is actually good, appealing the eyes of watchers. Her cosplay also reveals her stomach which is very nicely shaped (not to skinny, not fat, not ripped, but a really natural look, it’s intriguing to look at. Her makeup is good as well. It really brings out her eyes and makes her smile a lot more appealing. Secondly, I myself find myself fascinating at the way she moves. It’s very smooth and fun to watch. For example the spin at the start that she stops suddenly and kind of leans foreword then quickly straightens out, it is very well executed and goes along with the beat, making it satisfying to watch. I’m most obsessed with the part however when the song says “you got a boyfriend...” and she is kind of bobbing her way gracefully towards the camera. The way she moves most of her entire body when walking is really satisfying. She even does it to the beat of the song. And if also like to point out her shoulder movements throughout most of the video. They add a lot more energy to her movements. On that note, that leads us to my third point: the song and how she utilizes the song to compliment her movement. This song and lyrics itself are not that great, but the woman singing the song sings it well. That however, is not the reason why this matters though. The voice of the actual singer really fits the girl in the video. It not only compliments her cosplay (making it cuter), but also compliments her dancing. As I mentioned earlier, the way she moves is simply satisfying to watch, and part of that is because of how seamlessly and smoothly she move to the song. The spinning at the beginning goes very well with the chorus ending in the background. That little booping of her chest after the spin I mentioned earlier is timed when the rapper makes a rapper sound that transitions into the girls part (what does he even say? Is it like “bite” or “bye” or something? Idek) makes it mesmerizing and satisfying to watch. Her head boops are very well timed too. When the song says “hit or miss” as well as the “huh” after, she moves her head slightly too the beat that makes it better than had she not of moved her head. And then the little bopping/walking thing she does that I mentioned earlier, is so perfectly timed to the beat and the words of the song. And then my last point, is her facial expressions. Obviously, she has a beautiful face, but there are smaller things she does that bring out some of her key features. The way her eyebrows move is one. She raises them a bit to help her eyes look bigger at some points. Her smile is simply a work of art. It’s just very, very pretty and natural. Not much I can say on it. It just makes people happy. Well actually, that wasn’t my last point. I found myself watching the video and getting sad that it ended because it’s mesmerizing to watch. Than I realized that each time it repeated, I was hoping that it wouldn’t cut off at the end, thus rewatching it thinking, maybe there is more. This is probably because the song cuts at the end, leaving a feeling of incompleteness to the video, making me want to rewatch it to find the completeness (if that makes sense) because it stops in the middle of a song and her dance move, you feel as if there is more, making you want to rewatch it under the illusion that there is more... I guess. Omg perfect timing. I literally started typing this at around 30 minutes and it finished when I finished my last sentence. Well than, yeah. I guess I’m done. I might of repeated myself a bit but I was trying to get the point across. I hope I helped people understand why they kept watching the video, and why they feel mesmerized by this girl.﻿

For example, his diet is only red meat

I think he does it to trigger atheists
He doesn't really mean God in the strictest sense, but he makes a conscious choice to use that word
He says that all art comes from God
And thinks that expertise in psychology makes him an expert in many other fields
He says some really stupid shit
I didn't watch that particular video, but I've seen videos of Jordan Peterson before

It was just supposed to be a sad meme, but I realized it's pretty accurate
A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, a known atheist.

&quot;Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

”How old is this rock, pinhead?”

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”

”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

Avengers Infinity War is the greatest movie of all time. There I was, sitting in a packed theater of eager Marvel fans waiting to see a movie that they've waited years to see. As the movie progressed, I noticed the theater was not enjoying the movie. Time passed, 30 minutes, 1 hours, 2 hours, until a very special moment. During the final fight of the movie, as many people were starting to visibly tear up from a disappointing Avengers movie, we witnessed the greatest movie event of all time. Right as Thanos was about to kill one of the heroes, Gibby leapt from the bushes and attacked him. The theater started to whisper &quot;Is that really him?&quot; The crowd started to cheer louder and louder until I witnessed history. The crowd was chanting &quot;Gibby! Gibby! Gibby!&quot; Thanos uttered the line to Gibby &quot;You'll die soon enough fatty.&quot; The crowd was aghast. I was on the edge of my seat. The theater was starting to shake. Gibby looked straight into the camera and ripped his shirt off. I grabbed my soda so hard that it busted onto the man next to me. He was too caught up to notice. The cheering in the theater that night was the loudest recorded noise in human history. Every single man, woman, and child started tearing up from the beauty of the scene. Nobody expected this when they bought their ticket. A shirtless Gibby then bopped Thanos with his stomach, obliterating him instantly. Gibby looks into the camera, winks, and credits roll. The crowd started roaring and continued clapping for 30 minutes after the movie was over. As I was leaving, I saw an old man with the expression that his life was changed. I asked him what he was thinking of, and he said that the shirtless Gibby scene gave him the knowledge he required to solve an important formula. That man was Albert Einstein.
I was born into a family of non-yeeters. Every morning before I went to school my father would say, &quot;if I ever find out that you've hit that yeet, I'll thump ya.&quot; &quot;Yes, pa,&quot; I would always reply. It was a regular occurrence for him to burst into my room unannounced while I was relaxing or doing my homework. &quot;Y'all hitting that yeet?&quot; he would seeth. &quot;No, pa,&quot; I would answer. &quot;Good.&quot; He would then walk out of the room and shout, &quot;if I ever catch ya, it's a thumpin'.&quot; It was a difficult upbringing. I had seen my friends hittin' that yeet at school, and many of them encouraged me to partake. I would swallow my pride. &quot;No, thanks. I don't want to catch a thumpin' from pa.&quot; As a result, I was an outcast. A loner. I became depressed, knowing that I would never be like my peers, that I would never fit in - I would never hit that yeet. One day, when I was still but a wee lad, I became curious. I was in my room, watching Instagram videos of fellas my age hittin' that yeet all over town without a care in the world. My intentions got the better of me. I stood up, my knees trembling. Carefully, I leaned onto my right foot and raised my hand in the air. I breathed in. &quot;YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!&quot; My father burst from my closet. &quot;I told you I'd thump ya if I ever caught you hitting that yeet, nibba,&quot; he ejaculated. Then,  he thumped me. I haven't hit that yeet since. •• PART II: Until today. This morning was my father's funeral. At the procession, my brother asked me to say a few words. I told him I only needed one. With confidence, I approached the podium. I gazed out upon the gathering of sad faces. I cleared my throat and leaned into the microphone. &quot;Yeet,&quot; I spake. Suddenly, my father leapt from his hand-crafted mahogany coffin, the gunshot wound still in his chest. He sprinted up to the podium with the energy of a man without a gunshot wound in his chest. &quot;Y'all hittin' that dirty fuckin' yeet at my funeral?&quot; he ejaculated. He raised his hand to thump me. &quot;Not so fast, pa.&quot; I grabbed his hand. &quot;Yaint thumpin' no mo'.&quot; My father looked at me with eyes as open as the gunshot wound in his chest. A tear fell from his right eye, which also had a monocle.

You're not using Forsen's patented poise build? What are you even doing?
I'm just informing you of the day of the week
It's Wednesday

It's true
I've met far too many
I don't really agree with that
That's so wrong
You're pretending like only the meaning of the words themselves is important
no it doesn't
Especially if you don't believe in hell or any afterlife
The point I was making is that I think it's fine to say rest in peace or fuck you, because it's ultimately unimportant.
It's only about where your soul goes i.e. what God thinks about you
Your actions would matter, but not what people think about you after you're dead
If you believe you have a soul, it's already left the body when you died
They don't exist any more
How does anyone deserve anything once they're dead?
I don't know what anyone's doing
I don't think I have that.
That's old school
It doesn't matter all that much though, because whatever he was, he's just a corpse now.
Saying &quot;rest in peace&quot; is basic respect for a human being dying. It doesn't necessarily mean they were a good person.
I see you've been looking at Facebook

A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, a known atheist.&quot;Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.”How old is this rock, pinhead?”The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian””Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.Semper Fi. p.s. close the borders

I'm not sure how the wings work. I would definitely be 9w1 assuming the test was correct though because I scored only a few tenths different between 9 and 1
&quot;They typically have problems with eccentricity, nihilism, and isolation&quot; Might be a 5 FeelsBadMan
&quot;Well-organized, orderly, and fastidious&quot; why I'm not a 1 either
That would make me a 9 but &quot;to resist whatever would upset or disturb them&quot; makes me think I'm definitely not a 9
I think I'm not moral enough to completely be a 1 but I care too much about other people to be a 5, and I'm too individualistic to be a 9.
&quot;To compensate for being out of touch with their instinctual energies, Nines also retreat into their minds and their emotional fantasies. (This is why Nines can sometimes misidentify themselves as Fives and Sevens, 'head types,' or as Twos and Fours, 'feeling types.')&quot;
I feel like I'm a 1 or 5 more than 9
I could've gone either way on a shit ton of answers so I could have been 1 or 5 as well
I'm also type 9
I'm confused though because the numbers in the article don't seem right

&quot;PUBG Corporation has issued an apology for problems with the distribution of the in-game currency BP following the full release of Playerunknown's Battlegrounds in December, and promised that players who were shortchanged will be taken care of... But the responses in the reply thread are focused almost exclusively on something else entirely, and it is, to put it mildly, ugly: 358 pages (and counting) of demands to region lock China. (The thread is also predictably salted with racial slurs, so exercise whatever cautions you feel appropriate before clicking.)&quot;

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words, I'm worse than bronze. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

So I would only want that against Galio or something?
Why would you build Spellthief's on mid Xerath?
This is for mid Xerath though.
How is Spellthief's the highest winrate starting item for Xerath? Is it just because of the small sample size (31 games)?

I'm about halfway through VMA and have used 170 soul gems.
Wow
In ESO, the basic dungeons, even on veteran difficulty are not that complicated. The DLC dungeons are more complicated. Then trials, which take teams of 12, are the most complicated.
Movement is forced on you all the time. The majority of bosses use large AoEs. Skilled players can keep up the rotation while moving.
Veteran stuff is where all the good gear comes from.
You have to be 160 to do veteran dungeons and trials in the first place also.
The item level in ESO caps low though. The max item level in 160 and the max character level is 690. The difference in damage between a 160 and 690 player is big, but it gets much closer between a 300-400 player and a 690.
With the same items and abilities
There definitely is skill-based progression though. Getting a lot of gear requires you to do harder content. To beat harder dungeons and trials, you not only have to know and be able to do their specific mechanics, but you have to be able to beat the bosses quickly. The average DPS does 18-20K DPS. The most skilled players can easily manage 42K.
Yeah.
I wouldn't say expansions reset anything. Not in ESO at least. The item RNG is pretty bad though. I also wouldn't call it instant gratification, which it looked like Milo did earlier. MMOs are so grindy.
I was bronze. I'm still bronze.

Google Translate strikes again.
I think it is the first time I understand the deck before the question.
There are no cold blood, pods, agents, Quest adventurers, Zaryl, Shaku and Leroy.
Quest adventure itself is not just a throwing man, and as the expectations for growth are high, I need small token cards. Zaril, shaku, and tendrils play this role. Leroy went in because the quest adventurer needed a means to make a kill when it was all over.
There is no such thing in this deck. The original style of rallies originally surrendered to the timing of the mid-and-late timing, and once you're in the dill hat. It is.
If you thought of the backsight, you would have adopted vision giants, deaths, and sherazines.


So now we'll answer the question.
1. Reason for not being killed: Because it is not a deck of style to look after
2. Reason for choosing a sherazin: It's the same reason as the reason for not being killed, but it's a good four-keeper, but I do not have the tempo to bring on that turn right now.
3. Shakujaril is the reason for hiring: Since tempo play was a top priority, I removed the pod -&gt; I removed the draw card. Shaku, which can fill in a handkerchief without a draw, leads to adoption.


Shaku, unlike Quest Bankle, is a sailor who can just throw in three noses and can fill in the damage, creating a variable. However, Agrodeck is better than Agent, so it is safe to substitute.
But Zaril can not be replaced. All four dock cards are useful and give you two cards, so it's good to overcome the dry situation.
Drowdock, 2 Dildo: Just good, it can be used: Leroy, Broncle, Dagger, Cannibal all available, Obstacle Dungeon: Bronc Quest Gadget


I think the thief is a very difficult job to put in the dying and putting in the sherazin, and it is too difficult to go back to the other side of Agro Deck in a stable manner. The thief is a thief, so it suits me to watch the mid-timing Aishobu.




In addition, it is not in the state. Please understand.

After breaking down the walls and sieging for another hour after we were pushed back, they held it. At one point, the fort was being attacked from two directions by two different teams and the defenders still won.
I just came back from a DC and it looks like we gave up.
This is the most stalled siege I have ever seen. There have been at least hundreds of deaths over a single fort.
I'm talking about devastation on a larger scale: two teams of forty or more players dropping like flies and being revived to die again.

I was walking down the street and I saw this Asian woman with her two children. Right after I saw them, the younger of the two kids pulled his pants down and was walking around with his ass and dick out. The mom started roasting him in rapid Chinese and going ham before pulling up his pants. Then the mom and his brother starting walking away while he just stayed on the corner. I think she told him to stay there or something.

Understandable
&quot;Absent a genuine interest in history, many teachers simply defer to the information contained in textbooks. “They use the textbook not as a tool but as a crutch,” Lowen said. And chances are, that makes for a pretty lousy class. Loewen suspects that these and other textbook woes are largely why students frequently list history and other social-studies subjects as their least favorite classes.&quot;
&quot;Compared to their counterparts in other subjects, high-school history teachers are, at least in terms of academic credentials, among the least qualified. A report by the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences on public high-school educators in 11 subjects found that in the 2011-12 school year, more than a third—34 percent—of those teaching history classes as a primary assignment had neither majored nor been certified in the subject; only about a fourth of them had both credentials. (At least half of the teachers in each of the other 10 categories had both majored and been certified in their assigned subjects.)&quot;

- a random comment on UCBMFET
&quot;A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist

”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

”How old is this rock, pinhead?”

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”

”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

True. Some memes are good but rare
Not the fist.
Captioned screenshots of Arthur.
Not that one.
Yugioh, Star Wars, SpongeBob, Arthur, etc. are better.
They're not that good.
We ain't done until we get all them slides.
It was just a prank.
That was me that time.
Oops.
Better not play League then.
Team?

Judging by how many plebs use the other Pulsefire skin, this one will eventually indicate lower player skill than the original skin.
Sorry about the abrupt stream ending. I was trying to not get blood all over the place.

It was very accurate.
I liked the Ponyo one though.
It's always sucked.

Good riddance.
A couple of years ago, one night, I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.

Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend

Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.

In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?
Is this her?

This chat was created for the stream.
Is everyone even here?
Stream?
I don't know what that is.
That's pretty impressive actually.
OK.
Why not just copy the meme itself?
This is the second year in a row that's happened.
They arrested someone with a loaded gun at the DUI checkpoint they set up. Probably a drug dealer from town.
The police here were only issuing citations to bikers and drivers.
How was that?

It's annoying and I want it to stop.
Memes are funny.
What benefit do you gain other than annoying people and breaking Skype?
So why do you enjoy doing something that annoys many people?
That doesn't refute what I said.
You're basically saying you have to be told not to do things.
Quit spamming.
Kick Michael.
I can't draw, Milo.
Why? That would be an auditory massacre.
Anyone who spams should be burned at the stake.
Literal scum.
You're so fucking retarded.
