Hey 3% is pretty big tho
That's my opinion 
Nothing
We have trump as president, what can go wrong xd
I'm okay with this tho
To save old people
I had no idea lol
Good job mr president
In January 
Trump apparently already closed access with china like
But its cancelled for a week
For almost every class
Starting the 18th
Transitioning into an online class format
Starting friday
Smc is cancelled
Except England, as they arent part of the EU
Trump banned travel with europe
Trump banned travel with europe
In 2016
The dnc already told me to vote for a candidate who I dont like
And I live in California :)
I dont even like him better than trump
Not voting for joe
Talking about ranked, of course. Ranked is essentially as important to some league players as the presidency 
Young people dont vote often, nor do they vote well when they do. This is what league has taught me
Young people dont vote often, nor do they vote well when they do. This is what league has taught me
How can we expect people to vote well (or just vote at all) when we cant even get them to ff a game of league
I just thought of something that changed my whole political mindset 
he's been on cnn, he was a debate commentator
so unexpected! xd
oh blessed

ah, one of those nights i see
do you have boatloads of chinese people

the maokai has it all figured out
I've been matched with god 
playing to both sides
so she didnt endorse anyone yet
she wants to be one of their vps
likely
shes a bitch
thats all im saying lol
she doesnt have decency so i call her a bitch
and didnt endorse his policy
she ran on his platform
why
still a bitch!
xddddd
no endorsement tho
it finally happened
i saw
Wait miles is a real minister? A holy knight, perhaps?
It seems nothing can be entirely good this election, unfortunately 
While I agree that Bloomberg being out is a good thing, it does mean that Biden will have more support
Dont hold me to this statement btw
At least it's only 4 more years xd
If Biden wins the nomination I send my best wishes to trump 
I think I'm done with politics for a while 
among many other things
biden is a tragedy because he has dementia
And shes the most desperate person ive ever seen
Being overcome by desperation is a sign of extreme weakness
Not toxic btw
Shes a dumb lying bitch thot ass pipsqueek hoe
I hate Warren more than Biden 
Trump gonna win
This is his chance to steal bernie voters lmfao
Tfw I agree with trump more than 90% of the democratic establishment 
dont get me wrong
hey me too
xd
ok boomer
you like adventure time b/c of uti no
This seems fruitful
I'm gonna need to hear more about this
Oh hell yea
Actually my Swain was kinda clean nvm
Cmon rito
I saw that. Why the fuck is gromp in bot lane?
Ty all
Okay I need your assistance. If I'm ever high as fuck like last night and I try to pick anything but yuumi, stop me
its big lame
got bad stomach pains
no its amplified
my sanity is restored
pete buttgay dropped out
in same 
league?
game?
But I do believe some people see him as their nigga
I dont have the authority to make that call 
It's a lot of black people and they still see him as Obama's vp
Since before he started running, actually
Joe has been projected to take sc since he started running
Gnight 
No u
From hardstuck plat 4 to masters what a development

We need more smashers

Stay black 
Most presidents dont get what they want accomplished until their second term, when they dont have to worry about re-election : )
Same day at the polls
Same day registration in California btw :)
ALSO bernie is only 3% away from winning all the delegates in california in the most recent poll
I dont want Pete or joe running vs Donald Trump xd
Not saying they will do that, it's basically political suicide in the general. The chance is worrisome though, so vote accordingly 
Itll go to a brokered convention and the party can just choose who ever the fuck the want with super delegates
This is why I ask. Theres a chance that even if bernie wins the nomination in terms of votes, he might not actually get the spot unless he breaks 51% of delegates awarded
Yes indeed
I'm just curious about you guys, my vote is obvious enough
And of those who are voting, who are you voting for?
Alright important question, who ISNT voting on tuesday?
ITS TRUE
now thats e[b]ic
then you do situps xd
the second rule is optional
every death = 5 push ups, every kill = -1 to the total
Alright, here's the workout plan "League of Suffering"
am down vro
okk
anyone tryna play league with a young boomer
I got like 7 1/2 hrs
Uh oh! Looks like today is another lost coin flip! Boomer day!!
which kinda sounds like gachi
i am eating ravioli 
ty sir
checked off the list
but i like the story
well im not sure i 100% agree that bloomberg did this
its like a windows 10 with an ssd
its like a windows 10 with an ssd
but i cant summon it every day
my startup is good
but ive convinced myself it does
im not even sure if it helps
i sleep 8 hrs
still tired but less doomed
i feel different already after drinking water
but i know i dont drink a lot of water
i think i eat a decent amount ngl
its doomed
fuck
no
im dehydrated
so its the truth
i guess
but idont type either'
yea but i dont faint of breath rapidl
thats my rationalization
and i'll get used to it
okay so maybe i just need to do this more often
maybe its slightly colder 
isnt that what its supposed to be
my water is room temp
and im not a fan
it mixes with whatever food i ate
it just does
idk if theres any winning here
soooooo
but water gives me a stomach ache
and it booms me out
i think i work off too little water
maybe ur right
guzzled that shit like a champ
tall glass, all the way filled
and i feel a little better
okay i just had some water
i dont drink much water
ngl
maybe its dehydration
and take too much time
they depress me
i need to scrap all video games
i know how to fix it
im tellin you guys
even tho its 1230
i feel like passing out
i had yesterday
i like turkey sandwich
yes
to not boom
i change diet
ok
i had almond milk
its supposed to be healthy
JS!
and today is my boomer day
and granola today
i had a turkey sandwich yesterday
wtf do u eat
im done with the burritos
i have chronic no energy
xd
well you're lucky
true
im just boomin it up
that idk if its depression
like i feel it in my eyes and face
its so physical
some days are fine
some days are just doomed from wake up
a coinflip
its just
ds3 succ
no
it might even be the cause of my booming
i think it makes booming more consistent
no
but the level of boom is always the same
no consistency in frequency
i never considered how strong the placebo effect could be
but i guess it could be the boomer placebo
insta dodge
"im probably not good at this character anymore"
i only typed in one of them
damn i just got two ranked league queue dodges
xd
only granola for me
No pizza
oh good ty
haHAA
'its okay youll get better with age'
wheres the moral support
fuck u
therefore ive concluded, today is a boomer day
and i did worse than ive ever done
but then i fought a pro smash player on his stream just now
I played smash bros online, i couldnt move or do anything
some days i cant even move without messing up
some days im good, i have a reaction time and i can think clearly
I am a coinflip boomer
I've officially come to terms with something
Get real
Yea right
It was only a small amount of blood anyways 
Nah it was quick and painless
But I should get some dinosaur bandaids... 
Nah I got a white patch 
I'm truly growing up
Just blood drawn and didnt even wince
Ahhh si es muy bueno
Not para ti
Para me
It's for a late night after drinking conversation
Xd
But its not for the Skype group
I was gonna say smth
Which is probably is
Finally getting around to checking if its diet or not
Yea I've had bad stomach problems forever
Must not have burritos is bad for stool vro
Look at shit and write in diary
I must record stool sample...
My doctor says I must not eat burritos for a month
I thought I'd gain weight I hate
I eat burritos too much vro
Also, I lost more weight. I'm down to 150 lbs Y I K E S
Apparently it's a somewhat common decision and it can lead to issues of 4+ hour long erections
Funnily enough, I'm at the doctors and they were just talking about how people get knock off viagra from gas stations 
highkey a cool album cover

Funnily enough, the guy who posted the original image supports yang tulsi and bernie xd
Funnily enough, the guy who posted the original image supports yang tulsi and bernie xd
How does this make you feel
They're so confident on this one
It's pretty funny 
Yes they're retarded
They genuinely believe that if bernie wins Russia wins
That's only the right answer unless you're an establishment Democrat
Xd
Except Bernie doesnt want to work with putin
Highkey true
Dems just hear the word russia and lose their shit
And even if he does have bots  in place, who really cares?
Wow! He really do be supporting opposing candidates xd
Autistic country
And dems are actually losing their shit over this
They (the media aka Rachel maddow) are really trying to say bernie is plotting with russia to win the nomination
Theres still scholarships for transfer students though 
First year only F

he quicc
an upsetting amount of people are going to get laid after watching the Sonic movie today
sounds like a good dnd encounter
what a term
christcuck
but hey we're stronger so its justified right xdd
its not like they wanted to give up their land, but xd
definitely, the greed of our leading corporations was nothing but destructive to south america
yea we're on the same page
bc we have too many problems within our own government to go into those nations honestly and openly
we just kinda suck at it historically
yea i think thats definitely the approach to take
which statement? mine or gwyns?
i think we should fix our problems at home before trying our hand at globalism again
but maybe after we're more properly settled here we could try it
everything else is solid tho
that means we're getting islanders
at least he wants climate refugees, i can fk with that
but all dems do
bernie also wants refugees which sucks
xd
or the fact that he's at 2% and can actually do math
mustve been the hit piece placed on him by his former campaign worker
its true

yea viking guys are hot
and some of the guys look like vikings
northern europe hottest girls free
no u
tremendous 
terrific
wondaful
so i feel bored
b/c everyone looks bored
i cant watch that stream
NAH HE SAID FUCK THAT JG KINGDOM
tarzaned adc
or even better
so ill just watch nairo
now i dont know what to believe
ah yes
xd
you sure want a lot of change
for someone who doesnt like change
yknow
seems interesting 
im gonna read about that
yea
and kills speculation xd
that argument is too generally applicable 
yea thats why im saying that it seems unreasonable to assume society will reach asexual levels without a tremendous amount of scientific advancement
im just speculating whether or not most people in this society would be willing to take on this level of responsibility 
or smth along those lines
theres plenty of other situations where theres stepparents 
normally two parties are invested in childcare because the child is a product of these two people
then partnership second
i guess
im talking about childcare
but its not like everyone in the worlds gonna be the father figure for a kid that isnt theres
but its not like everyone in the worlds gonna be the father figure for a kid that isnt theres
in this hypothetical asexual society
so i think itd be different in terms of raising children 
vs having no interest in sex
this is the ability to reproduce solely by oneself 
this is a different kind of asexuality tho
seems hard imo
if you're asexual you have no reason to be with a partner 
imagine raising a kid by yourself
then theyre too powerful
unless gay women can asexually reproduce
yea gay people are good at that
xd
in a more pragmatic way
imo just find a way to lower the rate of growth of our species
and crash and burn
we'll hit our carrying capacity before then
i think we just need to change our economic structure to not require a constantly growing population
it also causes potentially irreparable damage to the environment 
b/c it leads to a greater worry of the finite going away
but i really just dont like overpopulation because of the tremendous amount of resources it costs to support a large population
but its not a tremendous amount of hatred
i guess
i dont like large populations because that means theres a high chance for more of those people to be more competitive than me
i can agree that i dont like people when theres too many of them
couldnt be me
theyre neutral to me
if ive never met them and know nothing about them
that i can associate with people
theres a state called neutral
no
i have to have a reason to dislike someone
that doesnt make me happier
and theyre poorer than me
but when random civilian x loses their mom in a car crash
i get happier
like when pete bootygay flubs
xd
but i dislike a lot less people than you
yea im happy when those i dislike dont succeed 
of the world around you
and personal interpretation
it is a matter of perception
i dont personally gain happiness from those who suffer
xd
yet half as political
this one is equally philosophical 
thats why people move into good neighborhoods
in fact, you might even be happier when you're surrounded by those who are happy
it depends on the flat value of your happiness moreso than the difference in values between you and your neighbor
its not applicable 
no b/c happiness isnt competitive 
its an internal stat
but happiness isnt a competitive stat
you're just proportionally happier
you arent even getting happier
but if you're only increasing your happiness by decreasing everyone elses
they just end up using the weapons back on us xd
but im not okay with arming the middle east
we trade weapons b/c theres a demand for them which im okay with i guess
the money doesnt actually go back into the economy 
nah its mostly company heads benefiting 
i actually dont know the profit margin for the military
you're right
and less money wasted on stupid ass plane research 
not tremendously, but definitely less international military intervention
and im for a smaller military overall
i just dont like deploying soldiers
idc if nobody cant stop you
and im not a huge fan of it
because that violates international law
xd
that we can renegotiate in our favor
and wait for them to come to us with trade agreements
just stay home
ignore it
except for trade ofc
lets just stay at home and fix our shit first
imo we shouldnt be such a globalist nation
or just staying at home
its about respecting international law
i just think its problematic when the tiger learns to fly across the ocean
except maybe china and russia
every country is too weak to stop us
its partially america to blame for this new culture
middle eastern religious states werent like that in the 70s
and im all down for helping those people come to this country
for our economy 
but we do need a steady source of immigrants in california
america doesnt have to
japan doesnt
in france they dont allow immigration anymore
look we already have too many people in this country
the intent is to come into this country without waiting for the big ass line 
but imo the policy should just be to send them back
if you commit a crime you're a criminal 
no theyre criminals tho
xd
too bad theres only one of them in the top 3
in fact i feel like he has almost no chance against any competent democrat
but i still feel like he'll lose
hes a good arguer 
trump isnt actually all that weak
it literally doesnt matter
as much as i have faith that he will win the popular vote
i wont make a bet until the primaries are over
if he doesnt win the primary its b/c dems are retarded
just pointing out that it was obvious he won and that the coverage is retarded
im not gonna expand further rlly
lmfao
it was so obviously corruption and media slander
it was so obviously corruption and media slander
like i said xd
also bernie won iowa
the fat redneck comedian is good too
is a classic
like the fat funny black guy
but there can be some funny archetypes with fat
but fat is wack
muscle is good
fat is wack
a very proven pseudo science 
time to look into eugenics right xd
idk i havent done the research
"despite being only 12% of the population..."
theres a reason that meme came to be
but i dont like modern hood culture very much

well since she didnt exist when lucian came out
epic
like when did she get this? in thresh's lantern?
then they gave senna a fucking cannon 
one from senna one that was his own
ok my issue with senna is that lucian was supposed to have two guns
thats like half asian female lucian
no wtf
the bands in her hair are solid
imo imo
the dreads look kinda cool
slander art?
wtf is that
thats fan art
sandstorm he dark
project?
which does ekko have
the reason being i didnt want to look at her
i banned zoe for 6 months
BOOM fixed
but let her scale with attack speed better
and nerf senna r travel speed
and hitbox
nerf senna w damage
nerf senna e duration
25 for an upgrade
nerf senna stacks
idk if you'd like playing her
idk if you'd like playing her
if they nerfed senna to being balanced
but imagine people who like toxicity Kapp
imo shes toxic
is senna beautiful
hey look, we can all agree that senna was a mistake
its definitely unnatural to say the least
idk seems weird
initially 
if you cant reproduce without the help of a doctor/machine
1 sex future seems unreasonable tbh
good to know it is
like 2 weeks ago
i was thinking about whether that was possible or not
oh shit its time
i had too much blue essence
i had too much blue essence
not even enough for the next new champ pepehands

L M A O G O T T E M

super bottom is probably accurate
maybe just a super bottom

real chad spotting hours
WHY WE SEEIN CHAD
woah
lookin like a straight chad out here
damn gotrek
Chad costa
I saw chad yesterday
ive played that shit and it just... isnt good
because lets be real, he made heroes of might and magic look good
and they just jump onto the sseth train
yea and theyre normally obscure enough to where its exciting for people to check out something theyve never heard of
Yes
Saw him at horchata but he got panda xd
That's wack
Oh hed reserve time slots for people exclusively when it was time to shit?
They're both autists tho
I'm not even sure if that's the same energy
No wtf
But not now, they arent worth disturbing his class session
And he'll make time for them at lunch
Yea he chooses to ignore whatever the person is saying
See me at lunch
That was sent to me by DAVID
Repost of an oldie
Companies almost always want way too much 
Companies almost always want way too much 
That should be the new wave of game reviewing, but it would likely lead to dishonesty 
Was just thinking that after I wrote it
He really can sell a game
i do want to try a podcast or something
we have to talk
if we're gonna do the podcast
xd
in this group chat
i write a ton
i write too
imho
but its also less productive 
typing it out is so much easier
by not going to discord to further this conversation
by not going to discord to further this conversation
we're all being total pussies right now
you know what
and beat my crippling fear
i spent my teenage years trying to be normal
is so funny
but its not the goal of every person alive
which is okay to do
no learning to conform is giving up on being yourself
look im ready to conform when im 24
we'll learn something from it at least
honestly down to try it
the things i like doing involve person to person conversation
call it an ego or w/e but i do believe its true
but i think i can do EVEN better
tech is my fallback plan
yea exactly
because i really dont like school
but if i cant i'll just suck it up and go into tech
if i can
and id rather avoid doing a ton of shit schoolwork
maybe its time to write jokes
but i do want a main gig too
as a side gig
unless you're good, that is
entertainment is where careers go to die
xd
me either thats the issue
what else is there
okay lets think outside of tech med and law
ive let myself boomer it up
i dont do anything
no
at least personally
but im not sure i could be fulfilled with that kinda lifestyle
b/c i'll succeed at it
all the logical paths say to do stem
you see this is why its troubling
AHHHHH
i dont even watch it
bc i really dont care about tv
truthfully i could never see myself being on tv
ive always wanted to try my hand at social media
talking to people is my style
im thinking id like to do psychology into therapy
i just cant find anything interesting
look i want to play the game of life
mars supreme edgelord
behind mars
you are 2nd edgiest eric
i dont think itll work
by going deeper
we out here breaking the slump
but im getting over it
s a m e
xd
lonely? more like depressed
no why would i
but it matters WAY more
valentines day is mothers day before the girls become mothers
or going to a restaurant that meets that vibe
chad move is cooking her godlike food and setting a table on a nice balcony
did u check that place out
dialogue 
what about that hidden place on the promenade
and she'll love you
she'll tell her mom you spent a ton of money
aight lmao
or check it out i mean
apparently its cool
go to elephante santa monica
from this love life thing
i swear thats what im missing
lowkey gotta find a rich girl to see what theyre like
then you just divorce and it goes boom
but its likely not
thats some pyscho bitch shit that'll haunt you if its true
"I ONLY MARRIED YOU FOR THE GREEN CARD"
she can hold that shit over you
she can hold that shit over you
green card marriage is od
so i have to make the effort
no, but i want her to be a reasonable amount short than me
very wealthy family
she has options
thats wack
shes a tall as me
if a girl is 6 feet tall and wears 5 inch heals
xd
lmfao
im not ready for a 6 footer
5'11 most
not that close to my height
but no
agree so far
and hand holding is wack
you cant even hug the girl properly
being with a super short girl
no it is truly kinda weird
im taller than 99%+ of women
LMFAOOO
find a tall girl?
gotta do what
how much?
really?
xd
i think 6'4 wouldve been good
being 6'5 is too tall
its a sad fact
people at the equator are too short for me
no?
faith was middle school
not like i did, just curious
i dont remember you dating any lmao
how many white girls did you date in high school
thats just how it works
thats just how it works
if the girls a psycho
me too can happen to anyone
actually
WELL
very true
those are good people
like swiss people who speak german and live in the mountains n shit
swiss germans are GOATS
but a swiss german girl is where its at
but a swiss german girl is where its at
i think a german girl would be great for me
and shes not available
so i cant build the habit
eventually if im with a short girl
itll also make my kids short
as 6'5
i cant be seen with 5'1
but shes too short
sarah is def the kinda girl for me
b/c hes never going to do her wrong
shes protecting herself from those options
she knows it, yet by dating diego
she does have options
she works there too!
ngl sarah is a reasonable girl
then sarah and i just talk the whole time
i roast diego with sarah for like an hour
diego falls asleep
it goes exactly like this
whenever diego and sarah come over
YO that relationship
the humor needs to be there
im not against it
i just want a reasonable girl
xd
so im still waiting
and you'll end up depressed
then she'll go all me too on your ass
and you might end up with a total bitch
compatibility isnt always met properly
no for a few reasons
for a reason
ugly piece of shit is a saying
nbd
if you're an good guy thats ugly
it speaks for itself
then theyre an ugly piece of shit
and you get along well with others
i dont care if you're ugly so long as you're not a piece of shit
see i value the well being of humanity 
HAHAHA
LMFAOOO
its just more complicated
gay people can reproduce tho
but itll be lessened
that worry might not entirely go away
how gay
the dream
lmao
they are a small country tho, so its easier to manage poverty
with their volcanoes and shit
with geothermal energy too
with child reproduction i guess
yea icelands on top of their game
that too, actually
so you typically hope to avoid it
is really detrimental to the family
just the amount of extra time to raise an autistic kid
anyways
im just talking hypothetical ideals
but i dont have an autistic child
i personally would rather not have to put the extra effort into raising them
okay but would you want a child thats cripplingly autistic
slight autism can be wonderful
okay but i mean crippling autism
and suggesting they terminate the pregnancy before it goes too far
before the kid is born
in iceland theyre testing for autism
id say it'd be catastrophic
until you learned to cope with it
temporarily that is
but youd learn to live with it if you're a decent person
so it is inherently less desirable 
yea the effort vs reward is lower
we can admit that no?
it would be catastrophic for the family
none of us want an autistic kid
autism is an outlier
b/c they talk to each with respect
so theyd learn how to act responsibly when talking to another human
okay id want 2 kids
theres a reason none of us are having kids
he can be a father
let him mature
not yet
b/c you dont like them
no failing as a parent is saying that the human being you created isnt worth your time
is letting your kids fail
failing as a parent
failing is part of a natural cycle of succeeding and failing
failing is wrong if all you ever do is fail
once or twice
whats so wrong with failing
real question, why
why
your children cannot have a nice world if they fail
no wtf
that protects all americans by providing them with basic human rights
yes so id rather create a healthy safety net
legitimately nazi ideals
btw
eric those are nazi ideals
we need to change that
through its incompetence 
that stops our own progress
we also have a fucked up government system
who cant be the best
we must account for the millions of others
since that is true
everyone cant be the best
and right now, they cant
i want those who arent geniuses to be able to live decent lives
because everyone isnt born a genius
good for him
and he took it
yea because he was a genius they gave him responsibility 
who says they were always like that
no theyre accomplished people already, so they can finally be cool
and being a cold blooded cut throat entrepreneur isnt it either
being high strung and disliked isnt what i strive for
its about being chill and respected
cool isnt necessarily the right word
not always
but if others say you're cool, you take it
cool people arent real people
id say a lot of them arent
not all smart people are cool
or by having a ton of money already
through their work when they were younger
well they got to that spot
oh
ive liked the ones ive met
how many professional actors have you met at dinner parties mars
theyre psychos tho
theres been some cool directors ive gotten to meet
theyre just rich
they arent at even at the top
ive met a ton of rich people in la, and honestly the only ones who ive liked are actors and people in the movie industry
but i did it in league so maybe im prepared
for years upon years
dealing with people and their massive egos irl doesnt sound like what i want to do
its as simple as that
isnt one i want to travel
the path to get there
b/c life is unenjoyable on the path there
okay look its not worth it trying to be at the top
yikes
if you think thats all government is
they dont suck ass
so when you meet randos on the street
and more people can enjoy it
so you enjoy it
just make the game fun
but still play a game
play a different game in government
b/c he was broken at the top
when at a 48% wr in solo queue
they nerfed azir 20x
for me
its easier
and nerf being a top tier
no just reform the system
and to impress lily graham
no me gusta rats
rat fuckers run companies
no
ur not wrong theres a certain appeal
are you gonna organize an army
and your body
ok but no government means that someone stronger can just take your land
but will companies exist without government in america
new zealand seems chill
why do you like no government tho
b/c their egos are massive while standing no chance
honestly i hate some of the democrats more than trump
and id want to make sure its a good time to do it
but i dont have nukes
lowkey same
luckily i mental refresh like no other
okay i shouldnt answer for you tho
i can tell
and to tilt me
mars wants bernie
b/c otherwise the backup plans become more and more reasonable
well thats why its okay to care about it
y/n
would you do it
when we can just elect sanders 
why bother doing that
only candidate that beats trump is sanders
btw
it COULD be with 4 more years of trump
thats because its not legal for them to do that yet
they dont even administer justice, its all biased
you'd be terrified by the supreme court justices
i can assume for you
they'll still be egregiously wealthy
the billionaires wont even get fucked
b/c i will still make enough money
i really do not care
idc
and are suffering to even live
who have nobody supporting them
but i do look around me at those less fortunate
im okay with my position
if we moved my grandmother would only cover rent
it wouldnt matter
had no spending money
supported by my grandmother for 10 yrs btw
and you still talk
its literally in the poverty bracket
my income says im poor, so does my mothers
id rather be middle class than poor
how is it worse than the poverty class
and the middle class is being destroyed
hillary had no change policy
hillary is still trying to influence the election
my point
registered 
ur not even a democrat
acknowledging that opinion
im no longer
dipshit
btw
im poor
anymore
eric nobody listens to that argument
and they try to cheat
by like a 20% margin
we didnt win california in 2016
if pete wins dramatically
no its not
of autistic californians
so the results of iowa will change the mind 
thats a proven statement
dramatically
and people still get influenced till the day they go to the polls
california is on super tuesday
ok what
its one of my bigger regrets
i shouldve been strong like you were
not important just wanted to name drop
i did too, b/c it was trump
he voted for clinton in 2016
who believed joe biden was going to win iowa b/c the media said so
ie my dad
it must be the opposite for people that arent like me
well if thats how it is for me
bc the way they shill out for the other candidates is despicable
bc the way they shill out for the other candidates is despicable
other than sanders
it makes me never want to vote for a candidate
yea
no need to be edgy when theyre manipulative
it matters!
media influences the election tremendously 
trump won by a slim margin last time
trump won by a slim margin last time
also it matters for media coverage
hussein
u understand young voters haha
woah crazy new platform bernie
but theyre even weirder when theyre rigged xd
coin tosses are a weird system
"flips" a coin
look at how this guy
you favoring trumps inaction means he didnt do much then right?
so you're just living in america
well both of them didnt do much
no charisma
hes just not as electable as obama was
obamacare was kinda wack so joes leaving it off the ballet
he did okay but i wasnt a huge fan really
from bush
obama had a recession to work with
like drone striking shit
and i mean the real obama days
but he cant form a sentence
joe biden is trying to bring it back to the obama days
but my dumbass scribblio comment is
but my dumbass scribblio comment is
xd
why isnt that in the milo quote book
i think thats a good one ngl
lmfaoo
just wants to pray the gay away
maybe hes a decent guy xd
at least
in theory
and jokes have the potential to be funny
at least trump is a joke
pence is lame as hell
i think he'd be a target by democrats
until you realize they havent done it to trump yet
thats not unreasonable
just like god queen hillary claimed
could be russian xd
but i like that theory
that aint it chief
hes gay
theres actually way more people saying hes an idiot
at least, some sources did
but the news already said that pete won
theyre gonna release the numbers at 4pm today apparently
bernie is in first
so that means the candidates who arent in first have a better chance to succeed
by delaying the results by three days thats three less days of press coverage
its about press coverage
the delegates barely matter
no you dont understand the purpose of the iowa caucus
lmfaoooo
they did
but
its actually the most reasonable assumption
its reasonable to assume they did it again
they admitted they did it
from 2016
from 2016
there are literally records of cheating
xd
and you ignored the simplest one
yet they count as much as other caucuses
only had like 16 people
some caucuses in iowa
yet he still tried xd
so its almost impossible to get away with rigging the numbers
so its way easier to fact check it
its like 300
being 10k
b/c instead ofthe numbers
the reason you cheat obviously is because you can
according to some sources
and they did change the numbers
they literally count human bodies
b/c thats not how a caucus works
of the caucus it was made to count
that didnt work the night he claimed victory
created and funded by the dnc and the buttigieg campaign
conveniently 
right after the "stop bernie" meeting was held
it was a startup that came to be just this January
it was a startup that came to be just this January
instead of fraud
so its corruption
yea but its the government doing it
changing terminology so they arent as liable
that in itself is corruption, whether or not they did anything wrong
as we speak
theyre literally rewriting negotiations with the dnc and pete buttigieg's campaign
its too easy of an excuse
and used it
no they knew it wasnt going to work
xd
and it wasnt
they said they were worried the app wasnt ready 
eric
theres an article about that actually
xd
its like 15 people
thousands?
corruption is just corruption
incompetence has variables
is a simpler answer
government corruption
that were working under the clinton compaign
yea and other employed government workers
actually
yea
or people who work for the government
is it anarchy if the government itself is doing it?
yes its huge
imagine paying the lawyers no money to do that shit
imagine paying the lawyers no money to do that shit
thats not enough money to rewrite all those contracts
so they arent held responsible xd
to use looser language
currently the company is rewriting all forms of negotiation they had with the dnc and buttigieg campaign
either way its scuffed
but this was just the donation budget, idk the actual money spent on it by the apps developers
but this was just the donation budget, idk the actual money spent on it by the apps developers
or the workers employers
also true
theyre just really seedy and corrupt
it was a really simple design
they didnt want it to work
obviously
it was intentional
its all the rage on twitter
it does
seems to be about half of the budget
which based on the transaction
around like 50k
Xd
it clearly wouldnt be worth my time
id never vote again
no difference
clinton
dipshit human
xd
and now clinton interference has been found in the iowa caucuses 
i wouldnt vote for myself
^
im just wrong when im high
and i dont do it consistently
no respect from me 
thats what i do when im high 
uses lies to win arguments
pathetic candidate
but he likes cops xd
theres no pride in being a snake
xd
did anyone hear about how bernie won the iowa caucus but an app funded by pete buttigieg and the dnc wont let the numbers through
amazing
"why are they saying this twice"
he just rewrites your shit so your presentation makes no sense
amazing
if only there was research done
wow what a take
ty
xd
maybe not tho we'll see
probably soon 
yea im down at some point
i find that shit
im ratty like that too ngl
i think the scavenger within you will guide your hands to the right pages
thats axe the puncher
look at that image
hes not even carrying one in this battle
at this point, i dont see any counterargument
he has axe beat
so i think
i cant even comprehend his size
holy shit he's huge
massive
probably has divine strength flowing through him at all times
so he has that on his side
shrek is also a recognized deity
that axe, in particular
axe or shrek
who would win in a fight
he is now a jungler
t1 said jg is ruined
no

game 1 he duo'd with an egirl on ivern adc

its starting to make sense
wait
with lines
this shit looks like standard clothing
good =/= wealthy
or is it a level of irony that i cant comprehend
isnt that the point of gucci
they dont even look wealthy
i couldnt handle that level of trauma
not like i saw it, of course
i did try to warn you with secondhand knowledge
shes showing her true colors
im surprised they let her be evil
ah shit xd
how does she fit into all of this, is she a communist?
thats what i was most interested in
how was the taylor swift cat
thats just the level of communism it reeks 
if they knew nothing
some would say stalin produced the original script for cats
DOOMED
so is dog
has dogs
gucci is dog
its doomed
they got david
i concede that i can see eyebrow hair

but joe?
i will hold my ground against slander of my eyebrows
xd
latina vibes

ez deflection
no u
he doesnt have eyebrows
me either
yes
b/c he wants to be joe's vp
now he says hes for the public option
he said he was for medicare for all
its flip flopping
no
but he flip flops too much imho
yang is so close to being a good politician

its not like china was ever going to help the people tho
not for the benefit of the people
its only useful for competition with other nations
yea
thats why i said when they focus on the gdp
yea i did hear something like that
thats what it really is
yea
for china standards
it helps
if its like actually somewhat decent
i actually dont know that
ok but how much do they get paid
instead of jobs
but its like when in america we focus on our gdp
i do get how they make money
imo
in a nutshell
but thats just china
its pretty fucked from a moral standpoint
theyre total bitches
but if they dont act after it gets bigger
yea its okay for now
seems like theyd be able to, just annoying that theyre bitches
but idk if thats the case rn
the issue only arises if they cant contain it
its true
i wouldnt be surprised if theyre just ignoring it
lmfao

used to work at my job
asian dude from texas
yea
could only talk about his favorite sauces
said that joe biden, when addressing the LA police
my homie paris
for a while
biden has been a wacko
but he was too afraid to say it
b/c that was the question that was asked
he was gonna say color
what were you gonna say joe
"nobody should be in jail because of co--- well they should be in mandatory rehabilitation"
its used incorrectly
and when
this man better know whether or not stop and frisk is illegal
joe biden passed the crime bill
"you have to stop the stop and frisk laws which i think are illegal"
but i literally cant understand what hes saying
im trying to watch joe biden
Sounds like a bait
No
It makes me want to get oblivion when it goes on sale tbh
Two worlds is bad oblivion
i do still like it
i do still like it
but my appreciation has gone down slightly b/c of the ending
they were awful ngl but they were awful in the classic two worlds style
i watched the cutscenes on some steamcommunity blog
thats a 0/10 for the ending of this version of the game
thats a 0/10 for the ending of this version of the game
it literally doesnt have one
so it just went back to the menu
the cutscene never showed up
the ending didnt even work in my version
and orcs
i did have a lot of fun just fucking up townsfolk
yea lmfao
10/10 dialogue tho
so that aspect gets like a 7
but the random fucking around is kinda fun
but the random fucking around is kinda fun
the main story is easily like a 2/10
4.5/10
so id say that overall the game is just a fun novelty covered in shit
but the ending was a piece of dogshit
actually air was good but only for the buffs
i even got to max rank in air and necromancy
all the magic was worthless
that like 10 shot the final boss
sold that shit, then went to the merchant and bought a noble three pronged fork
i just got end game gear from random peoples dressers
stealing shit was way too op
it got a little repetitive after a while
it was fun for a while
the charm wore off
and i already knew the endings, i had just subconsciously forgotten them
and i already knew the endings, i had just subconsciously forgotten them
ive never felt so disappointed
ive literally never seen a worse ending than the ending of two worlds
wtf is a coffee berry
okay 
lmk when
ok
ur thicc bicc
well calm ur tits
when are you free
we can league
for some time at least
yea im gonna two worlds no life
on ur team
imagine having him offrole
look at this one trick
im ok
from league of legends
as long as you dont chase shaco
botb
ty botmin
this meme leaves me going hmmm
so no queue but solo queue?
different schedules i guess
east coast has fucked winters
URSUS OCATVE
ill msg him maybe i can do one
idk when but i think in the next 30 minutes
uti is coming over
am now busy
no league for me today
true
but i need sometimes between my knees, theyre too bony
sometimes i'll put it between my knees if my blanket isnt enough
im a fan of the pillow
yea its not bad
but its not common
sometimes ill hold a pillow
except for my headboard
i have no way to lay against
but sometimes my arms get sore so i swap
normally its my left side
same
or nah just curled
you sleep in ball form?
computer to brush teeth to sleep
thats what i do
do you go from your computer to sleep asap?
so i believe in you
i worked mine down to 12
whats ur average
yea
what a good number 12 is
there it is, 12
there it is, 12
id say on average is 12.
maybe 15
i fall asleep on average in like 10 minutes
you see, as a man of culture myself
xd
eric is selfish never forget it
aight just wondering
or am i being fooled into something rn
do you mean a trans girl
so when you talk about your girlfiend
no corruption then
shit
yea actually whats the operation do fully
into liking shit
but im wondering if somebody can be corrupted
i know
after thats all he's seen for 10 years
that learned to love his own shit
theres gotta be some fool in a prison cell out there
jizzle
but in a playful way
or get off on the recreation of that moment
and then get off on it
and remember it
but they might think about it
maybe not in the exact moment
but they do
otherkin shouldnt exist
theres a kink for everything, thats what ive learned
you arent really committed to the kink right
if you cant take the hit
kinkshaming is good
my mom thinks its strange when women like getting beaten up
so youd win that war of attrition 
where id get bored of it
but idk you might enjoy it
no im good at taking hits too
im smurfing irl
i worked out for 30 mins yesterday
no u arent
i wouldnt have the guts
this is something i'll watch
is this conversation
wtf
xd
i do 
b/c a lot of the things you dont agree with her on
i guess
except to be agreed with
xd
how would i know what she wants
bless
also
but you've grown to be okay with
like stuff thatd normally be contentious
okay but im saying agree with her more on random bs that you find somewhat true
b/c you reject a lot of what she says
all im saying is that she would listen more to you if you listen more to her
y
well she seems happ
ive heard the things you two argue about
and if she doesnt that would surprise me
accept what she says and she'll accept what you say
and she'll listen to you a little
listen to her a little
and thats enough to motivate her
her parents will flame her
both at higher rates than vs those who dont do things
and tragedy falls upon those people too
good things happen to people who do things
they were successful and pushed her to be successful
it was her parents id assume
if times get tough
before her grandparents die
yea so she has more immediate wealth id assume ie shit she can spend
currently
she has more immediate wealth than you do, no?
shes not an enabler like i am xd
then
christina is a good influence on you
agreed
okay eric explain how
i didnt think about it that way
hmm
or affects your worldview
or affects your worldview
i should say
would you say that your own life is part of your worldview?
well it does at a very small level
im more neutral about nice things
for sure
he definitely enjoys the fine aspects of life and appreciates them more than i do
yes id say that some are
just certain aspects of your worldview are brighter
damn he really isnt wrong tho
theyd want to kill themslves
about how if their life was league
but they can joke
yea me either
yea me either
or have played**
so no
we all play league
youd become depressed and a doomer
and never want to try
you'd hate living
at every espect of your life
inting you
everyone around you always shouting at youy
and that was your game of life
imagine if you were always playing league
league is awful
but this is on my to do list
well i do
ive got nothing else to do
and cant display their excellence
the country doesnt support people who are in a shitty position
but we've gone over this
well they do have great people
that took them there
great LEADERS
yes and it was the actions of a few great people
theres no need for memes about jesus out here
cmon
okay but like
it jsut exploded
damn
s r r y
m u t e u s
but just remember to think about those who have a shitty game
if you like yours, thats cool
everyones playing a different game
they turn into bloody knuckles
b/c the trees dont turn into blocks
but they dont have the ability to break trees
b/c theyre playing minecraft eric
true
and sometimes you're playing dark souls 3 without a mouse
okay but sometimes you're playing pokemon
idk about most, i feel like many people do
outside of becoming the manager at mcdonalds
outside of becoming the manager at mcdonalds
where their excellence no longer matters
is that those people are immediately put in a position
okay but the issue
like if your whole family dies in a plane crash
or met with tragedy
to help those who are turned away
and what im saying is that our country isnt doing enough
okay but those who cannot rely on their family have to turn to something
that shouldnt be ignored
but if you cant rely on your country you have an issue
look if you cant rely on your family thats a separate issue
elevating millions of americans makes your country a better place
until our country is in a position to do so
i dont believe in globalism
im not talking about millions of kenyans
no i said we should help american children
we're talking 1 american child to 1 american child
yea
the issue you're raising isnt on point tho
xd
by voting properly 
and i can
if i could help millions rn i would
i'd expect them to help millions over themslves
and if they were
they arent
at little cost to the thousands that are being protected
why make thousands of peoples lives better when you can make help make millions of lives better
to me its all numbers
The actions of a few thousands shouldnt be protected if theyre harming millions
i dont need to go on abt it
eric you already got my point tho
but we choose to offer healthcare
thats true actually
some are dying in hospital beds
some are too weak, some are mentally ill, some are just stupid
some humans cant
so it is up to us to protect them
some people are dying due to the actions of other humans
this is the same for humans
some of them arent even valuable and we choose to protect them b/c theyre dying off due to human intervention
yes, because they are valuable to their ecosystem we should keep them alive
and they arent even people with the ability to be successful
and they arent even people with the ability to be successful
the endangered ones are protected
SOME
to kill some animals
we deem it acceptable
but we give out permits to kill animals
w/o the right permit
okay fine
it isnt tho
this is the issue you missed
ILLEGAL
murder is
theres a reason that kingdoms in europe fell
than laws should be changed to help preserve our economic structure
if its not a moral obligation to help those who are suffering
if the reason is to preserve wealth that billionaires own, i dont agree with it
why not make it more accessible 
why not make it easier
im talking american politics
china isnt america
because we have the wealth to do so
so i believe we should restore it to a better place than it once was
the possibility has been slimmed down tremendously over the years
so i believe in helping others, regardless of their families lineage 
i can only imagine how much worse it is in countries like india
ok but their greed has created an unsustainable environment for millions in our country alone
when you can just help people who are struggling now
wealth isnt immortal so why try so hard to preserve it
then what remained was stolen from her by her brother
and all of the money she acquired in art was burned down in a barn fire
no what happened was tragedy struck the family
my family is the living testament of wealth lost
but he's living on other peoples couches
and my dad is the first son of her
to this day
my grandmother is the greatest art restorer in the world
my grandmother is the greatest art restorer in the world
besides a cool story
but what do i gain from it
i said yes
what
?
but i dont see that as possible
well if you can work that out for me i might agree with you more
but i dont get anything for it
i am
no
should i be forever honored?
b/c my great great great grandfather was the president of france for 4 months
how can you argue that when it just isnt true
this is what i dont get
so your argument is invalid
yet hes alive
and many of those people are criminals whos decisions hurt the homeless man on the bench more than you're saying
we can help people now
and if the money is going to be taxed anyways, why not just tax it now?
so the future generation doesnt have to do anything but hire a good investor 
and the money itself is allowed to make money on wall street
unregulated
yes and thats okay, the issue falls in the fact that it goes untaxed
if you're supported by others its multiplayer
that means that life isnt single player
but what im saying is
xd
and life is a single player game
the individual didnt
yea the family did
yea the family did
but the poor person who doesnt know how to get a job is your issue
and work to ruin the lives of others
develop horrible personalities
there are many children of rich families that do less than those of poor families
and you feel like they dont deserve it because they arent a part of your family
so your issue is that youre helping others as well as your future children
which we can do if we take down the billionaire class
if they get a decent education
id rather create a good system of government that ensures its almost impossible for them to fail
just to survive off my wealth
well i wouldnt want my future family to have to deal with a bunch of psychos
not the top 10%
and i mean super rich
but its an issue
thats another, separate issue
yea but its been shown that children of rich families end up being "worse" people
just doesnt add up in my book
because the actions of a few thousand ruining the lives of millions
by the billionaire class
the issue is that the middle class is being destroyed
your words not mine
"if you live out a middle class life youre not going to be affected by crippling poverty

stable career, happy marriage, kid or two"
like 10 minutes ago
which is what you literally vouched for
thats a false narrative
if it did i wouldnt do it
if it did i wouldnt do it
but the numbers dont say that happens
it doesnt
instead of voting to hoard wealth for people who arent born yet
i just think its important to vote to help people who are alive
i just vote
not like i do anything tho
at least, in my opinion
all im saying is that planning for the future isnt as important as making the present a better place
if they were alive id understand
well nothing they arent born yet
you could die tomorrow and what did your mindset do for your kids
how are your kids family if they arent kids yet tho
than something
you care more about an idea of something
not the ones who havent been born yet
imo help the people who are alive first
you will have to pax taxes
and how comfortable you are with giving away money you dont need
its just about what you do with it
id want it to
well obviously youd want the money
i dont have a billion in the bank waiting for me
but thats just my opinion
its an issue
m e n t a l h e a l t h
m e n t a l h e a l t h
and live on the streets
spiral into depression
which caused these homeless to lose their jobs
especially if the wealth hoarded came from job cuts
and see what they have to offer
so just help them out by taking money from those who dont spend what they have
and we cant kill them
mentally unstable
who are cold
there are a lot of homeless people who are dangerous
its a good community, but there are problems with it
i see where i live as a community
but i didnt use that as an argument
ngl
i really dont think all mexicans and blacks "and like the monkeys they are, they flock behind the brightest, most decorated one"
also its unhealthy for the economy
idk
this is inherently criminal
and they do
i mentioned that they commit crimes
did i mention success
i assume all billionaires are criminals
so the same way you assume all black people are dumb
that most of the billionaire class
does that
and it just so happens
srry
i dont support criminals
and getting away with it
theyre abusing laws and people
no it is justice
its a simple as that
so i think its worth it to take them down
and i care about them more than a few billionaires
but i see there are others who arent
me too
which is the case
and you cant clear them out b/c its out of your control
what if you have friends and family on your server
into quitting the game
and constantly gank ur new players
what if rogues from the horde are too op
but like
you only have one perspective
life is a single player mmo
not everything has to be about me
i think its morally wrong to support such a destructive class
and as somebody who cares about people
much more often than i would if the billionaire class was nerfed
but i have to see people in crippling poverty
obviously
like it does currently
so it doesnt bother me
but what if i dont want to be a riven main
and our laws
and our laws
its a simple as that
are bad a balancing
but some things are op
you spawned at lvl with the ability to solo kill everyone
you didnt play well
its like prepatch riven
needs a nerf
if you're good
its too rewarding
its that the class is destructive
its not about me wanting to be a billionaire
no
yea
they are cancer
but its a bad meme
the 3rd one aint that bad
shannon meme
school isnt hard its just awful
show me an example of what you mean
xC
xC
i respect peacock culture
peacocks do that too
and one of them was anaconda
but i also dont care since shes only ever had like 2 songs ive listened to
does she write her own stuff? i do not know
she is an icon created by a bunch of other people, at least from a fashion perspective
and i dont like her
its based off nikki minaj
the china pleasing cut
i just dont like her hair
imo
wont be able to jg anymore
they are nerfing it
must be a bad character
too popular in china
qiyana ban good
he just wanted his wife back
leave him unbanned
lucian is a good man
league of legends
theres only one game thats possible in
you know what else is an advanced technique? the shurima shuffle
xd
and you used a tier system to describe her at all
you put sothis in b tier
a dm, of sorts
it was for u
yes
yes
so d tier
f tier is full of non humans
shes a child she cant be b tier
d tier
at least playing against them online,, that is
but i hate a lot more of them than i like
im okay with a lot of smash characters
behind byleth during an attack
it was just a massive png of sothis
it was disgusting 
jett is justified
okay did you see the final smash though
but im down
might be unrealistic
most fighters have jumping
or no
hmm do we need jumpng
or jumping
no platforms
and give me sword vs axe combat
just remove all the bs smash mechanics
how much better would that be than smash
ive wanted that for a while
with just fire emblem characters
i want a new fighting game
agreed
online
i want free wins
ez
just make byleth best character in the game
12 days
b/c as a man of culture, i appreciate our weeb overlords
b/c as a man of culture, i appreciate our weeb overlords
and i love it
this is actually the worst thing ever for them
yea its hilarious, but if you know the smash community
then decide
ill look into the characters first
yea idk if i need it
new house i guess?
3 houses dlc too
but it may not be enough
but it may not be enough
xd
this is the best time to start
no im right
xd
never a better time to start
never a better time to start
you just didnt look
its on the sothis one
better
im okay with it but i think i like the solid look
pog
and her smash render has reasonable sized eyes
that everyone hates so much
edelyth even removes the stupid design on the tights
reggie lied
he lied
the only reason im sad
im lazy
pls
send it
i just know this from watching the direct
#4 is edelyth
i will exclusively use skin #4
i will likely have a very good byleth
maybe dair doesnt even at half
ganon can do it right
im hyped for that
yea lmfao
seems amazing
wait this video
so someone higher up than him
it was nintendo
although, he didnt pick to add byleth
yes
he had time to learn bullshit in his life
hes also like 55
in his office
he even hung the posters himself
but we knew byleth was inevitable 
this is true
somehow
unless byleth is fun
agreed
and the worst final smash in the game free
insane right
thats it tho
no magic
she has 4 different weapons
but wait for the next fighter pass, these were all supposed to be 3rd party
if you're gonna add byleth im definitely okay with that
didnt think it was necessary
was gonna say smth
hes said it himself
also true
he makes some pretty good jokes
he is a comedian afterall
yo anyone ready for league or no
at least im not playing dota 2
aight
OK GAME LEAGUE
cast aside by its owner, moss lied in wait for someone to take it to a new home
its origins are unknown
moss was found in a sailors garage
Cleanus pog
jett made it go from green to brown xd
I need to give moss a good scrubbin
nice n clean
league is the devil for sure
im down in like 10 minutes
a true tard
ah yes
this man is dirty
if he doesnt assist in lab cleanup
he probably doesnt even shower
oh god
oh no
xd
impossible to match their class
we have the infinitely classy chinese in league
what was he like tho
if u say dota 2 ill be mad
But yet here I am, watching their video after playing ranked last night
Too weeby now
league
ok
i bet you dont even smoke crack
fuck u gwyneth
so yea ig
just like how good the rocks are
it depends on how good the new champ is
The new sett champion spotlight video is a pretty perfect example as to why I quit league
doge hasselhoff
ty
a happy meal
so is that like
wtf even
russian dota memes about mcdonalds
that idolizes doomers
b/c the meme was made by someone who is authoritarian left
its been understood
thanks china
and we ffd at 15
my mid lane dies solo 4 times before 6 minutes
i just got filled into jungle for a 4 man chinese premade
That's the fun of it for some people
Ok but what was it like tho
Gz
So entertain me
Im pretty curious
Mars what was it like
b/c "we're dying younger" is somewhat more interesting than the subject of employers saving money
which is essentially just click bait
they start off with saying "were dying younger" and then they just change the tone immediately
but theres another issue they should be writing about, i guess? it seems weird to address the issue in positive light is what i think the issue is
Since when does the light not heal
Forreal tho why does lux have a shield and not a heal
nvm
o
unnamed hero
js
in that video im ezreal
i feel ez in that frame
No garen had a small head

Awkwardly as fuck
They were stretched
Rewatch it
Yea it was scuffed
Irelia looked like ass tho 
Irelia looked like ass tho 
Kaisa was easily the best looking model in the video

i think there will be enough boycotting
watching this
bless
i cant even see my minimap
i cant be
no
also true
that feels so good to say
the draft will dodge me
at LEAST
and im like 20 pounds underweight
ive already been diagnosed tho
the power of booming
tyty
say it again
^
ive always had an out
ive never been worried
im not even worried about the draft
b/c it isnt my field
i trust you on that
do it for the guy that pays more
if youre gonna build fucked shit
yea duh
but im not moving
im morally with them
i mean
i mena
thats what some dude said 11 months ago
not the us citizens
as targets
they have trump and mick 
which is on our ocean
for our future where we fuck with china
not me, but its not a good look
iran gonna bitch and hopefully kill him
is that we as a country elected a leader thats dumb enough to bomb strike and kill an iranian general
well anyways my big issue
is it out?
not relevant just reminding you
xd
okay but you could die in a car accident
honestly
i like the idea tho
no
and they have a ton of power
and there are people actively stopping us from helping it
known as earth
we're on track to kill a planet
so humans
we are humans
we as in humans and us
i mean
its totally likely that the on path to getting to where you can do any of this shit
its totally likely that the on path to getting to where you can do any of this shit
we fuck each other up first
js
before we can plug ourselves into a network
we gotta survive earth first
im not gonna get up and check tho
but i think im looking at my other keyboard
its kinda dark
but i have another one
yea
er
its way fucking slow
thats worse than just copy pasting it
to hit a key on my keyboard
if i have to use my mouse
ok
dude
so i lost
its not good enough
and 3 mouse buttons
if i have 4 dead keys

it registers it
it doesnt work
no
i have a keyboard that i can plug in

and that everyone else doesnt kill you in their god form
well this is assuming we find a way to properly transfer consciousness 
200iq from mars
6 arms pog
but thats basically you just be god
i guess you could do that
but id get bored of waiting to see new shit
do you just die at that point?
and repetition sucks ass
eventually you wouldnt really see much else new tho
i think itd be kinda boring 
he just wants to see shit
thats reasonable
yea thought so
not attacking just wondering
other worlds, species?
space travel?
come from all that efficiency 
what do you really want to see
but why be efficient
when ur old
well you say that now
agree
except the terminator
and androids are always gay 
id still want to look human tho
well you could always off yourself
sure
i mean, maybe id warm up to the idea when i saw one
that seems like the right answer
Not wrong
And you can get corrupted
But if you get unplugged you're done
That's too taboo for me
Not if its heroic that's for damn sure
That's some soul shit
Yea I dont think thatd be possible 
Since youd grow a new brain you wouldn't even have to worry about the physical deterioration 
Since youd grow a new brain you wouldn't even have to worry about the physical deterioration 
I mean, would my brain eventually deteriorate tho. Becuase this is lowkey anti aging 
Not sure exactly what I'd change yet, though
Especially since I could likely just do it again anyways
Yea I'd probably experiment at that point
Eventually I'd do it to be younger, though
Eventually I'd do it to be younger, though
Especially because I already look so different from most people
Hmmmm that's a lot to think about

jett when are you arriving in the station
^^^^^^^^^^^
but you dont have thick gorilla padding
they try to intimidate more than actually scrap tho
they just dont practice constantly
nah they are
well itd have a few seconds to rip the shit out of whatevers attack it
i feel like a big ass body builder could, with a lot of luck, slice through a gorillas thick ass neck
well it depends on the knife right
gorilla is 1800
the guiness record for a body builders bench press is 900
gorilla free
yea its all about terrain
i think a gorilla beats a lion
okay but in a 1 on 1 boxing ring
it starts making its ape escape
jaguars have a stronger bite than a tiger and a lion
jaguars have a stronger bite than a tiger and a lion
but its still weaker than a gorilla
they have insane pack tactics
nah i think lions are higher tier
f
maybe*
and make leopards
only humans do
but a lion doesnt know that
and their throats are actually rather difficult to reach with a bite alone
gorillas have padded necks
anything else is a female
between 88 and 90 degrees is a male
crocodile babies have their gender determined by the amount of heat the egg is subjected to while its forming
a silverback gorilla can bench 1800 pounds
a silverback gorilla can bench 1800 pounds
while a lions bite force is 650 psi
and has a bite force of 1300 psi
except a human with a gun
that it can still beat
a gorilla is pretty much the last thing a tiger wants to fight
but i think a tiger could take a gorilla
well compared to a gorilla a lion is a rogue
gorilla = barbarian lion = rogue
while a lion would likely win in the wild when its able to use terrain to its advantage
after my mere minutes of research ive learned that a gorilla would likely win in a 1v1 boxing match style of fight
like actually just double in strength
gorillas have a higher bite force than lions
wait
im looking into this shit rn
okay but apparently gorillas have really well protected necks
silverback gorilla vs male lion in its prime
who would win in a fight between a gorilla and a lion
this is why i can only theorize this
i feel like its self evident
do i need to break it down?
i can theorize this
we eating lamb out here
guess so

I hate
U no see and u hate...
U hate vro
If you liked nothing about the first one you wont like this one at all
Imo watch it, it was a good movie 
But on the biased milo scale it hit every mark perfectly
Was frozen 2 actually a 10/10? No
I try to at least xd
I say truths
A lot of woman on woman hugging
Frozen kinda lesbo tho
U = gay
Which is what really matters
It didnt feel like he was added for a quota
I say they made it work tho
So it's actually a surprisingly modern setting
Yea for sure, but it wasnt upsetting to see him in the movie, apparently they even have photographs in that world
So it wasnt totally unreasonable, the royal family definitely travelled right 
As a guard
He was tied to the royal family
Alongside a bunch of natives
He was well implemented 
Very pleasant to look at
But the magical effects were really well done in this movie
But the magical effects were really well done in this movie
This movie still had the classic Disney plot of love being the strongest magic
But mostly in this enchanted forest
But mostly in this enchanted forest
Still Arendelle 
So they could do more with it
Because the setting was established
It was certainly a better story this time around
Which is both good and bad
But didnt have let it go
Frozen 2 was better in a lot of ways
Frozen 1 was gr8
This movie was a win for the boomers out there
And made me realize that they're shoveling shit down kids throats

Frozen 2 was good

But I hope you can do it on your own because that isnt for like a week and a half
Jett I'll help you when you're home lol
And she doesnt actually support the bill, in fact she says she wants to write her own bill
The bill is already written 
Medicare for all isn't just an idea, it's a bill
To win the primary
Shes a neo liberal posing as a progressive
So its likely impossible to pass it with her current plan, which she knows
Which is the time during a presidency that most major bills just get fillabustered or dont work
Well I've looked into her Medicare for all plan
Shes just a good choice overall and is a woman, but shes comparatively mediocre imo
But still maintains all the things above
Less corrupt and cancerous, less of a liar, less progressive than other candidates 
Warren is like a lesser Hillary at this point
But media rigs shit really really hard
Like this is probably what most of the democratic party thinks

Nice
I'll still be on summoners war tho xd.
My problem is that I find myself too fascinated with the watching part compared to the game part, so I spend way more time doing that. So if I cut the game out, I'll lose the fuel for whats causing me to watch it and I'll actually be able to try and accomplish shit. I might install it when I'm in a better mindset, but I need to break this shit at least for a while
^
And I'm cutting that game out mostly too
Which took the rest of my time
Well, that and smash bros
I wasnt doing much of anything else honestly 
It was that I was surrounding my life with the community of it and just watching shit about the game
The problem wasnt the actual time I spent playing the game
The game isnt the same anymore, I know it's a risk uninstalling it but we have to persevere we arent retards. It's also too addicting for my lifestyle lol
I dont have it installed but I kinda want to redownload it so I can stay connected with like philip and shit

Ok retard
Since trying to hit L was a mistake most of the time 
I grabbed with the y button on 3ds
And it worked well
I moved z to y
The game actually fucked both L and R buttons tho
So I liked it better
Either that or I was just better that way
Yea
And im not even joking 
Honestly liked the game better with limited controls
Smash 3ds was a good time
Nothing gets past yoUwU
Dang right through the veil
They put so much effort into the handheld version 
Best example of all time, though
Smash 3ds was legendary
My uwu got cut off what the frick
JwU

Even more so when its handheld vs console
The gamecube version of some games just looks different than the competitors, like battle for bikini bottom

big HMMMM
dang
lemme check this chimp
LESGO
it was an easy read
is that qts stream title
And he likes it obviously
I think he does it because there's a market for it, and with his fame from an lcs career(somewhat failing at that after worlds xdd) he can get support from his fanbase. Also, his girl is a cosplayer so she likely convinced him to do it because she could assemble the costume and do the makeup for him.
I think hes a courageous man, personally
Straightest trap ever. His gf is either the perfect beard or hes the most confident man alive 
what a guest

maybe 25
nvm
well he was easy as fuck
doesnt need to be harder
doesnt need to be harder
any boss that can do this
mars
dude its omega fucked
but i die too quickly
of that attack
im trying to get a screenshot
lmk when vort does that shit
flies and shoots missiles of light
dude this thing
and it fights like an asshole
this is what it looks like
even though its the same being
is because its a new boss
okay so the reason why
^ autism
ill show you why you dont have to restart
when i get a good screenshot
they knew what they were doing
id stand no chance
luckily
we in it
ooh i get to refight it from phase two tho
theres a phase two and it instantly one shot me
wait
i skull fucked him
lets just say
har har har
but her players are still dogshit
tbh the q nerf already put her where she needs to be
by far
yea
is even worse than her design
her implementation in game
thats where i wish you were wrong
gotta be present or your cat is aids
doesnt cut it
some mage
yea but
otherwise shes cancer
but she needs another side to balance her out
im not against that
like if yuumi was just some magical cat that somebody worked with
as a side gig shed be cool
as a side gig shed be cool
lmfao
but no shes a champion
yuumi is cancer
to save it
theyd really have to reinvent to wheel on this one
its been bad for so long
yea but i think leagues lore is already ruined for me
i do like the art tho
its all gameplay 
but im not playing this game for varying artstyle
although dark souls had some cool lantern effects sometimes
thats for sure
souls likes arent known for their lighting
very guilty of that
in code vein
they are guilty of reusing assets 
i think it looks better than souls tho
well to be fair this is in the pits of the deepest parts of the catacombs of the government building
i must admit that i dont like the designs of some enemies
i must admit that i dont like the designs of some enemies
but i really dont get whats wrong with it all together 
whats wrong with the artstyle
the artstyle is good tho
everything looks really nice together imo
but theyve hyped him up to be the final fight
but theyve hyped him up to be the final fight
it makes me think theres more after him
i dont like his name
but its kinda groovy
well it didnt work
gl me
aight
mid attack
w/o him being blurry
that i cant take a screenshot
he can move so fast
lemme get closer
beat this fucker
how does that
eric
aight
hes kicking my ass
to help me beat the final boss of code vein
yo what song do i play
but i will try to understand his side
i pick fire emblem and spam nair like an absolute degenerate
sounds op
10 hammer
they should have no issue winning any election if they just banded together like republicans did
imo
is the democratic party
the biggest fault of this country
this is a big country
that most people wont agree with you
but do you not see
ie people want gun control
are being challenged
even the 10 fucking basic laws of this country
its physically impossible to get 61% of 335million people to agree on anything
or your sample size
you cant let a few rotten apples ruin the country
according to every media source at this point
according to every media source at this point
and trump lost over 50% of his base
hillary clinton had more votes than trump
61%
dude do you even know what percent of the country voted in 2016
if you arent arguing honestly
i cant argue with you
whats up
whats up
you just dont know
like you said
95
yes but that isnt
and talk like you know everything about it
on this
you just dont do any research
its really small comparatively
no
 to further your argument
and you just are saying no
they literally learned
the people who voted for him
those are from his base
even higher now likely
71% disapproval rating
they can learn tho
they just didnt see who he was because they were told too many conflicting stories
he's the least popular president in history
and now that they see who he is
they trusted him, they believed him
they only talked about trump
cnn, fox, msnbc
b/c media wanted to get their ratings up and make more money
making him the most talked about person in the country
trump came to power through dishonest media coverage and a calculated string of lies that further pushed the media to cover him
we'll more than likely make the right choice
if you take a whole country worth of people, remove corporate greed from media sources, and let those who are truly the smartest state their case for why they should be in power
until we can choose again
we just wait
if we choose whos in charge we dont rebel
to make everyone happy
yea thats why it works
leading to a nation utterly fucked and doomed 
otherwise theres no system of checks and balances
through corporate success
they shouldnt buy their power
but those in charge should be elected 
before it happens
and i think that should be stopped
eventually they'll use ai to systematically oppress people
their decisions are fueled by greed, not by good intention 
with what theyve created
to make good decisions
i just dont trust those who are in power
and if it means i dont have to work as much im cool with it
im sure i'll adapt fine
look i dont really care about the future all too much
at the same time
then its up to us to set other examples that can fix both of our problems
yes
but im saying that since they still envy us and see us as their goal
its obviously for self improvement
eric they wouldnt increase the size of their eyes if they didnt envy another people with larger eyes than them
trust
so badly that they do surgery to increase the size of their eyes
china literally envies american culture
and people wont invest
intentionally cap the return on investment 
just need there to be no real incentive 
and i think itll happen
the 100 millionaires
break up the billionaires 
thats why its important to elect the right people
its literally up to our government
laws and enforcement
so we likely shouldnt do it
we already know that ai can systematically replace most humans in this country 
me either lol
how does it make no sense
xd
and english people are the likeliest to get them
they make your breath smell bad
always check for tonsilstones if you're of english decent  
oh gotcha
college slows learning down and structures it for you
to learn it on your own
some things you lowkey need college to teach you or you just have to have amazing work ethic
while those are all valid complaints, its really about which field you want to work in
we should get the college system on being racist
xd
and topple the whole structure 
almost immediately after your internship is done
and they can lead to real jobs
they teach you relevant skills from people who actually work in the field you plan on going into
i think internships are okay too, actually
maybe i need to raise my social credit score
heres an internship
but no they dont want me to leave
i have the gpa
i have the credits
i just wish they sent me an email saying "hey you're done with our school we'll help you transfer sooner!"
i know im very aware
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
but wont let me transfer
i lowkey hate that smc sends me a ton of emails about how my gpa is high and i should apply for all their internships
as it should be
ok gnight
but now its gone too far
i was gonna like the 2nd one
shit bot 
didnt know what to make of it but good to know its real ig
i saw this but in a different form of imagery 
some things never change
1 damage off lethal
i just lost to a 10/10 that killed my whole board and my whole hand
but obviously card draw
no rng effects
i just pretend to be mid range then i one shot them
i love this game tho
no rng feels really good
i think this card game has a lot of potential
so its playable
100 cards
i get to unlock w/e i want for free for like
enjoying smorcing people on day 1
aight the card games kinda good
xddd
no u lol
xd
i got access to the card game beta
wonderful lol
thatd be optimal as fuck
hope it works
gl with that honestly
yea 40 hrs i assumed
a job at amazon is pretty desirable even if it is a lot of work right
i think id just be chillin with that
lets go connor
is gonna be good
he
id be happy with that salary too
^
yea thought so
is he salty now lol
ah dang 
who cares thats good enough for him he'll take it lol
and the only way to know is if i try it
see i want to know if i do
also i dont think my phones good enough to run it
still a chance its dogshit
hopefully
but not shit
okk
yes
id just watch it
it looks kinda good but its hard to explain
and change focus with your buttons
and you tap your abilities 
and slide n shit
drag
like age of zombies
and its capped at 20 mins or smth
100x better than every other mobile game
yea but that on mobile is like
that looks kinda nice
mobile league tho
But it could be because it's still in early development
Only game that doesnt look decent is that shooter
It looks like paladins
44444444444444444444444444444444444444444444
but we live in one
traps arent real
jrogan
agreed
mhm
that means absolutely nothing
they were on track, jogging
are their words not good enough
we got the zoomer vote
and immediately they both said theo
one asked this question to his friend
i was biking by two high school students on the way back home from the beach
just look at him
ok but hes loving it
but hes lowkey spasming 
he cant even use his eyes, its too much of a burden on his mind due to sensory overload
theodore free
When we dont ff for 10 minutes xd
League of legends can suck my legendary dick
It's like a word based gangbang 
I love getting off work and reading these
People can only contribute their creativity to society if they cant work any jobs due to their skill level
Sseth
All the time
All good videos
Then I watched the heroes of might and magic saga
Wait I just watched this video this morning
their name was cuteneko06 or some shit
use x3
i saw somebody today in summoners war chat
omegalul
imagine in 2019
imagine being too scared to do a solo vein run
imagine being too scared to do a solo vein run
xd
not that useful
they only last like 15 seconds tho
like consumable res items
through purchasing specifically resistant items to the  2nd boss
i eventually started to buy some cheese
spent 6 hours on two bosses today in code vein
WHAT WAS HE THINKING
metal kaiser slime
king bubble slime
badass
^
and his majesty is the most wonderful of all
slimes are truly wonderful
bestow upon him, one should say
offer him a papa bless instantly
hes the KING
truly a legend
he highlights the good parts of the game
its a good video
insane
lets go dunkey
wow dunkeys first good video game review in a while was for a game i like
xd
and then shattered
rocked
same
lmfao
-reggie fils amie
"If its not fun, why bother?"
through a repost of an image from 4 yrs ago
the teaser is out boys
ye
IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
I WON
then had to go to work
i got her to last hit 3 TIMES
ill league after i beat this boss in code vein
Im sure having it was a stress fest tho
honestly
I liked reading through it
What a good conversation
But not as far as winnie the pooh
Wow saying that pyke cosplay is blackface is really taking it far 
You need donkeys 
its ween time
look at the time
Especially if they dont know the true meaning of the statement 
Imo it's just as satisfying to beat someone to death with kindness 
Gotta just be super passive aggressive 
That's what you get for being fair
Guess it's back to not saying shit xd
I was expecting to see some of the buzzwords
Huh I wouldnt have thought youd get banned for this shit
but didnt
was gonna say it
ok bensl
if select people know it
theres a certain amount of information that just becomes known
or if you're a grower not a shower
depends on what you wear
nah b
i know these things
the rumors spread
no its not
ur retard
its good
yes
6'4 gud
6'5 too tall
but thats not a fair trade
thats something i would do
gz
eyy
i dont fuck
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
but also seeing ur slutty ass come back to bite you
mustve been a real bruh moment
seeing two pigtails
seeing two pigtails
mustve been hilarious oh god
LMFAO
we did discuss that
you're not wrong
cmonBruh
imagine trying to convince people through a manifesto
right on the money
ah dang
seemed very opinionated xd
got some marxist vibes yea
owo
gotta respect what makes a meme a meme
fair
mhm
was about to say
surprisingly meaningful shitpost
it was a good summary too
thank you david
you cant ignore all of china
i talk to nobody at smc
aight later
especially
Sharpensycle 
thats a good name for a bike
damB
but it wont happen
later would love to continue 
to take a test
on my bicycle 
but now i must go
hell yea
that meant a ton
it was the perfect stepping stone to allow for further inference
i loved reading it
im glad it was so good
"damn thats sick you almost got her dude"
nobody today sees that and says
like sexual harassment in the workplace
ur old news
if you dont adapt
and people get called old
no but thats why times change
thats some logic thinking
okay bensl
thats a good way of saying it
OOH
military*
allow home growth
cut that mility
globalism isnt a race anymore
deadass we need to calm our governments ego down
if theres a solution for them thats realized
i think its a good idea to remove people from the workforce
dont forget that
too
but there are many extraneous factors that dont allow people to be like you
eric sees value in himself which is honestly inspiring to some degree
thats a good way of saying it
i think
eric is a person of extremes
eric just takes it to the extreme
but you do have work ethic
it shows companies that you werent wealthy
its a stepping stone
you're supposed to move on
its true
i always do yea
i need to get out
its lowering my work ethic even lower than it was
im getting degenerative cancer at smc
most people, actually
some people arent willing to let go of it
while you arent wrong
so its the other side of the coin
you were raised rich to some degree tho too
but in america i do not know the statistics
its about the people you're looking at
yea
you are colored but you got the luckiest one statistically 
isnt that ur argument
eric some people are just incapable 
imo
jett isnt wrong
xd
and need to pay rent
some people have no money
ALSO
id say its like 2% at most
no but they can
it starts there
have you ever seen texas lmfao
yes they do wtf
thats why theyre so afraid of losing their guns
and weapons
tools
they have brains
its not like theyre lions
you underestimate numbers
they have numbers
and all your money gone
government collapse
revolution instantly
yea
i think its definitely a learned thing
see but you were taught how to work
its chance variation 
lmfao
no?
true^
that lacked by so many fucking people
thats a very special skill
well the thing is that eric was taught how to work
its about actually doing shit
no we all have talents here i think we all do
and were developed off that tremendously
at a young age
by your parents
you were fortunate enough to have your talents given to you
okay but i will say this
obviously its objective 
or, people who view themselves as goodhearted
b/c you contradict their system of beliefs
eric most goodhearted people dont like you
i dont watch movies
i wish taxes were better
keep everything else to yourself
idgaf
if you pay your fair share of taxes
good call out
not wrong
i dont think thats a strange position to actually hold, but to actually say it in class with trigger people
thats only strange b/c its university tho
just unrelenting aggression
the aatrox
understood
that creates fun
its just negative emotion
ofc it is
it was deserved
LNMFAOOOO
even
who dont want people to know shit abt them
they could just be introverts
i dont know these people i dont go to university
they could just be disappointed with themselves, so they dont broadcast their true image?
they just dont want to create connections?
its not that lack all emotions right
oh
b/c its university 
theyre not trying to preserve their self image
they dont care
maybe its just 
or they just flaunt it
is it a situation where the only place theyll show it is with their friends/lovers?
xd
i did not
never saw it
not wrong
that aatrox deserved it
but still
ig
it was an aram
same
in the end i guess its still just shit tho
same goes for all that shit on it
the idea of high ground isnt good IMO, but it can def have supporters right
it just looks like shit
honestly dota's map isnt inherently bad
Sleep tired yess
Ok I go to bed gnight vroooo
Nada
I've tried tho
Doesnt even help :(
Theres like 2 in smash bros 
Theres like 2 in smash bros 
One of them is dark blue too
That REALLY fuck with me
Fuck maps that make vision hard 
I see gotcha
Theres a lot of green
Do you think it's the colorblindness that makes it hurt, perhaps?
But what about Apex and you
But its dim so is passable
My internet box's light is blue so I actually just never look at it
That light fucks my eyes up so bad
You know how blue Ray's logo stays on even if the machine is off
I cant stand it
So maybe it's the same for you and high depth maps?
Not like phones but dark blue light on signs n shit
My eyes hurt when I look at blue light
My eyes hurt when I look at blue light
But if it hurts you then it hurts
From my experience 
I think the character models are suss but the map genuinely looks good
What about it hurts
I need to lose the boomer mindset
Actually nowadays im likely much better off on pc anyways 
Actually nowadays im likely much better off on pc anyways 
Or is it PC exclusive? Idgaf
I'm down to try it with you if you're playing apex on pc
Bc I succ
And I hate shooters on pc
Damn this made my kinda hyped
i home...
okk vro
Going to Wendy's should be like 10 minutes 
Gotta get food with my mom real quick
Nothing cooler happened that's p much it
I also let eric get a game and he won too so I looked like a chad jungler 
And got masters from d5 in one night
So I got nearly 200 lp per win per game
Where I was playing league mobile and the lp system was fucked
You know I had a dream once about a year ago
League was fun today
Home in 20
Instead of peruveans we're gonna have Nokia users
Instead of peruveans we're gonna have Nokia users
Skip ahead like a minute to two minutes 
This is lowkey undeniable
Guys league of legends is actually coming to phones
Riot dumbasses cant type
F
Is the truth
Janna every game
I wanna know if he spammed chat
Penisretard69
Holy shit you got to play vs the legend
After code vein likely
I'll stream it soon TM
ill remember this shit
bc theres literally no way
ill request your guidance
when im on dark souls 3
its gonna be fucking abyss watchers
game
but after this ame
idk who that is
b/c he was a champ
in sekiro
i spent more time on the armored knight
i only tried to beat abyss watchers for like 35 minutes
and a will to go on
im full of adrenaline 
i can beat anything
i beat a big thicc anime bitch in code vein
by myself
i can beat that easy ass boss
thats pussy shit
no
weak ass shit
fuck using summons
right
oh
infinitely worse
and they spam quotes about everything around you
and they revive you
and theyre broken
but its an ai
yea this is the same thing
bad
from them saying aids ass shit to me
i got ear cancer
i not only beat it without dying once
forreal tho i went through a whole zone with a partner
owo
you didnt even say anything
clap
okay ez
true
if you're a real man you tell your partners to fuck off
but theyre also really fucking annoying b/c they spam quotes at you
but if you do that the game is braindead easy
into the world with you
you're allowed to take a partner from your base
the thing about code vein is that it secretly has two difficulty modes
It had to have been someone else first
Like zoe taking the throne for most autistic league champ 
And in this case, it happened
It's not impossible that something new strips the title of something old
Sekiro is now just japanese dark souls
Sekiro isnt even half as anime as this
Nono
Only took like 2 and a half hours xd
I finally beat the boss that was giving me cancer
Welcome back Florida man
simply put.
code vein is just anime dark souls
code vein is just anime dark souls
They arent good
They will be defeated 
legit boomer apm and reaction time
but yea im fighting the equivalent of genichiro x the abyss watchers
"its just a turn ANIMATION"
ITS A MECHANIC
its better than zoe tho
ew
that fucking generic dragon launcher
id say
when you get past the launcher
when you get past the launcher
the clients almost identical tho
that was weird enough already
right?
like 6 hours ago
i was on this game
how did this come to be
oh wtf
this is just where i logged in
see look this is dark souls
nvm brb
my corndogs
hol up
ill send you a screen shot
oh god
and the haircuts
just the character models are weeby
but the in game art looks nice
i get to make a thicc anime bitch
i like the art style
to think
that i legit have no brain power left
it takes so much of my attention to try and react to things
b/c i also lack forethought 
i still try to react to everything the best i can
so i just try to predict everything
like
i have lie
and then reacting
its just understanding what theyre gonna do
if i cant outplay them by mashing harder
if i cant outplay them by mashing harder
xd
is that really even outplaying?
so i have to respecc
i just wanna outplay them but i cant b/c its unfair
b/c im too impatient 
i really havent
yea
xdddd
b/c i didnt beat him
i only mentioned him
or maybe im just really bad
in code vein
fair
how does it feel to face the hagermeister
how does it feel to face the hagermeister
and i dont know them for ds3
its all about knowing the frames
i never got enough attack speed to know the truth
i dont remember that well
wait can you not auto during the turn animation in dota?
the difference                                                                                                             your explanation
xdddd
yea thats what miles says
but theres quite the delay
nah i got used to swinging p quickly
feels like im lagging
swinging with a weapon in ds3
so i never complain about a shitty engine ever again
is to play a ton of dota 2
i think the way for me to beat them
those abyss watchers are going down
itll happen
we're still working on the compromise, okay
i know i just didnt like their rules
it never budged, so i didnt either
the very engine of ds3 felt like it was working against me
sad!
no creativity in that game
abyss watchers werent worth the effort
so i stopped playing it xd
so its delivering the dark souls experience
i cant beat this fucking boss im on
but after playing it for a while not only did it get really good
so i got code vein and was lowkey thinking it wouldnt be good b/c, simply put, it had the most generic intro of all time
amazing
i liked canadian skywrath
i liked canadian skywrath
or whoever that is
or whoever that is
ah
free rosh pog
what if hes just not feeling it
what if hes just not feeling it

let riot control your wallet
xd
tft
hey
IF ONLY
dang
anyways yes i do have a taint, but you are tainted
like only by name though
it always feels like they do it poorly
i like when she starts praying, but i just hate when league characters refer to other league characters in their quotes
no you have the taint
i am pure
no you 
i thought the quotes themselves were a little overdone at times
^
thanks for the scoreboard rito

no wtf i think jail time is good enough
no wtf i think jail time is good enough
he might away with rape in prison
but he's pretty tall and well built
send him ladybugs
send him ladybugs
The woman told Bruggeman she would seek a restraining order if he did not leave her alone. But he continued to write to her, police said. Three days later, Bruggeman sent her a message stating, ‚ÄúI am interested in raping you one time for real,‚Äù along with other graphic language.
About three weeks later, Bruggeman texted the woman multiple times from a different number, identifying himself as a rapist and writing, according to police, ‚ÄúWe are truly an underrepresented minority in this developing world, and it‚Äôs difficult for people to understand the struggles of being a rapist in today‚Äôs day and age.‚Äù
wait you should read this
On Feb. 11, 2018, according to court documents, the woman and Bruggeman were watching a movie at his fraternity when he asked her if she liked to be choked. She told him the question made her uncomfortable and that it wasn‚Äôt a topic for them to discuss. Not long afterward, police wrote, Bruggeman approached the woman, put his hands around her neck and choked her until she couldn‚Äôt breathe. He put his body across hers so she couldn‚Äôt move, and slapped her face multiple times, according to police.

that could change my opinion of this
actually idk
crazy that the bruggermeister got away with bail for now

i understand the topic but not the point
tbh im still lost
at what time is slavery not okay

thats kinda good
see
aight
after i realized that i got bored of most memes
b/c you know it was created by chance, not by somebody trying to emulate what chance could lead to
but it being a shitpostbot should change your perspective of the meme
is that just a shitpostbot
or like smth to connect to
or like smth to connect to
i like there to be some semblance of reality in my memes
its too unbelievable
but "my wifes boyfriend" got overplayed FAST
if you stoop to the level of irony its at
the first one is only slightly better
look at what you posted

id have believed it
i just autismed the last bit
and he did say there are only two
nah im spreading lies but he did have a funny comment about a gender professor
the 1st one
the 1 stands for the fact that he is one of the genders
i just learned this
tyler1 says there are only 2 genders
it reminds me of miley cyrus
thats why
i dont like her make-up
fuck memes nowadays

although his w dmg will still be similar until late
and thats where he was most broken
his early game got nerfed

so they nerfed tk bottom lane too
they also nerfed his r range and nerfed his w's usability on allies
so i doubt he'll be better in a solo lane
and increased his q cd
they nerfed his w dmg hard

Let‚Äôs talk about the next VGU we have planned after Mordekaiser. It‚Äôs none other than the Man, the Myth, the Legend, Pantheon! After Mordekaiser, Pantheon is the last of the pizza-feet champions, which is to say he hasn‚Äôt visually held up very well over time.

is it actually?
but forsens having a really hard time
i was worried itd be too easy
and it has a skill tree
but it still retains most other elements
yea it loses the element of customization 
you play as sekiro
you just cant make a character
actually i dont even know if it loses most of the rpg elements
I am flattered
if you like punishment then dark souls is your thing
well its certainly more of a game than dark souls
dark souls is just confusing
the game actually looks like a game though
I better be
minus a lot of the rpg elements
dark souls but good
sekiro is like

I like surprises

despite being so simple
look at how good this is
still think 21st century schizoid man is their best song :)
did they really use that in jojo lol
nvm solid
this is gonna be cringey
the teacher is just funny
well mako is godlike
both godlike characters
yup
(yes)
even tho it was mostly japanese
i really liked the music in kill la kill
im a led zeppelin guy
thats way too fucking loud
okay michael
thats made by posers
theres a lot of gay hard rock out there
hard rock &gt; metal unless its cringey
idk
its kinda like jpop mixed with jazz
id listen to it
like evas opening
and i really loved the show
unless it was a really good anime opening
^
Pog
have you seen their muscles
jojo is definitely art
so id say it was worth it
kill la kill gave me hope
id say super was a success 
and it gave us the ultra instinct music remixes
SO GOOD
this man isnt black
totally worth it
dragonball super gave me goku black in fighterZ
nothing makes sense when you have dragonballs that bring people back to life
dragonball is wild man
but we'll see how i like jojos
i like shorter shows TBH
nice breathing
yea cmonBruhs
no diversity 
thats a little disappointing i guess
xd
okay so yea 3 is perfect
i like that one the best
which one has star platinum
like really good
isnt part 3 good
KAKYOIN???
yea good save
good answer
and tried whipping you
now what if they were in highschool
:^)
i see
oh so you're into 17 yr highschoolers too
and plot
outrageous writing
i think thats the point of the whole show right
see if we like it
and try watching jojos with him
i was gonna wait till jett got home
Fair enough.
is that the first one
i understand now...
like not live
like vro
live what mean
miles you watching jojo
SAME
crazy how you guys are more autistic than an autist like me
like the good ol days
that sparks autism
i gotta do more shit
Haha, it's true
Splitters!
god bless
you see how much me weebing out helps to bring us together
i dont think thats what he was going for
i like my strat better
indeed that is retarded
but i agree that overall its probably around an 8/8.5
xd
so its rlly a 10 to me
see its an 8/10 that panders to literally everything i like
they should make anime characters 18 at the end of shows
but rlly tho
nice link vro
which i respect
for being a weeb
mars just wanted to give me a hard time
its not like it actually matters
hell no
i am a good boy i dont fuck anybody
in FULL
entirely
kappa
so mars couldnt write shit like this 
tbh i wish they made her 18 at the end of it or smth
btw
your mom 12
17 in the show
whatchu mean
she is the main protagonist
what
LMAOOO
i love the show
thats okay i dont love her
for kill la kill
my love
i must express

no feathers
we're done
who would lather us in tar
dual is an aggressive dominant male
thats just reality
thats not a dream

&lt;3
we've been given the power to overcome it
michael now that we've talked about it
id have some great dreams otherwise
me too its gay as fuck

but im definitely stronger underwater than in my dreams
i was gonna say that
maybe less
im at like 15% of my normal strength

mr musa

Embrace it
halfway there Pog
look at how good the league client is
VERY INFORMATIONAL
no fuck you bitch ass black male
agreed
The game wouldn't let you express your skill because your character was too good
He's so good you couldnt kill anyone pog
I couldnt possibly be any better at the genre
I discovered that battle royales are my forte
games competed in
10/10
still one kill
played my 10th game
^
miles is still at 0
games a 9/10
out of 9ish games

I do not remember
Offer?
do you want vro
Oh, I know
Did I?
I really do not
Seconded.
women are equal and deserve to be treated with respect
how so
get played
frame 1 rock main
fuck you
rock
1
2
3
ill count down
rps rn
hey mars
yup
player*
but im a passionate scissors play ideally
to counter them
i main paper
need to burn
unga bunga frame 0 rock mains
rps one is godlike
ree
FeelsBadMan
and doesnt even have sprite work for combat
gonna be big weeb
fire emblem 3 houses
but yea
thats nuts
ive never seen that but i can imagine
oh my god
instead of 7
only important nerf was that his succ lasts 3 seconds
yea lol
his nerfs were basically irrelevant tho
definitely didnt deserve it
dedede and krool only got nerfed b/c theyre good online tho
and itd make his walling better
like itd be annoying but youd still be able to get by it
i think itd be good tho
or bair a little bit bigger
yea something like that
just dont make gordos good again
buff him in other places idc
it was a godsend
no
i havent played chrom vs dedede post nerf
maybe with the gordo nerf itd be easier tho
when im ridley its way easier
online
hes just good vs chrom
honestly tho
thank god for that gordo nerf
fuck dedede
yea
and dedede is perhaps my single most hated character online
online
but i see a ton of people play her
i dont love zelda in this game
lets go dedede
WAH
dedede
thats what he is
hes a fucking dick
it seems like you are
it seems like you are
are you part of the plant gang mars
you cant react
i should say
well you can only read it
legit cant read that
its a threat
if you shroud yourself and use down b
that ones really good when you use it in the poison
poison is good
and the poison i guess
like 95% of plants power is budgeted into his recovery and his ball
WAY too strong
that spike ball is too strong
i think plants best move is neutral b
b/c theres just a better version of it
thats the only reason its not incredible
just slightly
its worse ivysaur nair tho
its okay it works
just nair
thats why ridley works
and profit
same as chrom just nair and fair
its dumb
yup
or forward air
because its the easiest button to press
every character thats good in the early meta of smash will have a good neutral air
then up smash or fsmash on reads
and try to ledge trap and juggle
literally just spam neutral air
you jump in and press a
hey
actually a goon
ridleys a fucking G
i play ridley
plant gang
its actually horrible
that recovery is still fucking ass
mixed bag
chrom is a fucking
but hes fine in ult
he wasnt good in melee or 4
and, true to his game, still sucks
the 3rd worst unit in his game
roy was like
not only would you be an indecisive bitch, but youd also suck
imagine if you were forced to play as a weak ass bitch like roy
but corrin was definitely low tier
theres a lot of other shit it couldve been
well hold on
and corrin is a fucking indecisive bitch
the story is still shitty though because you have to play as corrin
so its actually fun on gameplay alone
yea conquest is perfectly difficult
its okay
like gameplay wise
conquest has its place as a game tho
3 biggest problems with fates are: the story, the weebiness (specifically the fucking affection bullshit), and the entire hoshidan side
yea
that is
fates
but now im kinda thinking its not as bad
hated it the second time
you know i liked fates the first time i played through it
w t f
you're a professor mars
no it kinda is
this is excessively weeby though
thats what i was saying earlier
yea...
teaching bratty kids
but no you're a fucking teacher
and you picked a side
i thought itd be a war story
when i imagined 3 houses
it doenst make any fucking sense
like what were they thinking
LMAO
the professor
but you're
ill give it a shot though
and not at all what i expected
its very weird
yea i did
yo
apex is kinda boring to watch
Nods
im gonna go reread it

Huh?
Well, now I know
Yeah, I know haha
Haha, I know

second to shooting

and they removed the sprite work
(like it wasnt going to be xd)
FeelsBadMan
i am sad because the new fire emblem game is just more weeb trash
Then do it
I would cry
If his sister dies, Ed transcends 
Having one flaw that is completely avoidable is fair
Ed from Ed Edd and Eddy is the strongest
Thank you!
Agreed.

LEAGUE IS BAD NOW
ITS SO BAD
THIS SHIT IS LIKE A DND OC
As a mage born to a poor Demacian family, Sylas of Dregbourne was perhaps doomed from the start. Despite their low social standing, his parents were firm believers in their country‚Äôs ideals. So, when they discovered their son was ‚Äúafflicted‚Äù with magical abilities, they convinced him to turn himself in to the kingdom‚Äôs mageseekers.
HOW
LUX APOLOGISTS AT RIOT WILL DIE
THIS IS SHIT LORE
Sylas formed a bond with LuxSquare Lux while he was imprisoned. In exchange for information of the outside world, he would teach her to control her magic due to magic being outlawed in Demacia.
What's up?
IN ITSELF
LEAGUE LORE IS BASICALLY A MEME
Sylas dresses like a prisoner due to being previously incarcerated but continues to do so in order to appeal to the downtrodden masses.[21]
WHAT HERO IS THAT
NO
EPIC
Precisely.
Wizard
LEBLANC
DOTA MEMES SUCK

What I wouldn't give to have "those" places back. The favorite places of mine I showed you that I can't walk into without being assaulted by the bitter loneliness of memory. Restaurants I loved that I took you to are no more than graveyards for our love that I can no longer bear to visit. My soul resides in these places, and I'm sure you're taking another to them with high spirits and smiles while I lay in the catacomb that once was a home.

What do you know?
not wrong tho :))
if not more
studying their field
comparable to a scientist of his age
like the amount of shit that qt know about league as a concept is like
what a great guy
and transitioned that into a multi million dollar streaming business doing what he loves
a biologist 
but he used his intelligence to be a professional gamer instead of like idk
who says dumb shit for the camera
because you start to realize that qt is actually a very smart person

you know whats strange about english, you guys have a word for dried grapes: raisins. but the strange thing is that in french the word grape is litteraly raisin, but we dont have a word for dried ones, we just say dried grapes but in French so raisin sec BUT THATS NOT EVEN THE THE CRAZY PART because do you know what we call a bunch of grape together? a GRAPPE so a bunch of grape in french is Grappe de raisins  :thinking:  :grapes:

No matter how much time we spend apart it never gets any easier. Food doesn't have the taste it used to, music doesn't bring me the joy it used to. All of my thoughts remain of how much better life was when it was lived together with you. Doing the exact same things every day without you is by far the worst horror I never could've imagined. And yet, that's what's become of me. You were the battery that powered the sunlight of my life and without you I'm a flashlight that cannot flash. I often wonder if you're powering somebody else's now, or you simply didn't want to be mine.

I am the chad techies
especially knowing that you lost a % check
pa is also very fun
yes!
storm spirit looks very fun to deal with
because that kit is toxic
I ban thresh every game
so nerf dmg is gud
hes too tanky with it and he does too much dmg
more than any other champ
but I always get cucked by graves red smite
so hes technically getting nerfed
imo
graves is gonna be nerfed the hardest by the red smite nerf
cam for sure
and they said theyre probably gonna nerf them
its literally just Camille xin
in the current jg
I like nunu
but jg is getting nerfed
and a jg buff
this is a direct buff to adc
this is a good thing
Ignite 
Damage lowered from [80-505 (55+25 per Lvl)] to [70-410 (40+20 per Lvl)]
Cooldown lowered from 210 to 180
I think they know we're done with 3 ad nerfs

which is nuts
irelia is still gonna be good
turns out it was a shitty mechanic
but on champs, yes
technically quinn's q disarms monsters
the base hit never disarmed
anymore
no it doesn't disarm at all
now theres only 15 more bs champs to go
removing all the extra fluff from irelias kit
riot being smart
akali next
from their mistakes
actually learning
riot is
Irelia
Ionian Fervor (Passive) 
[Removed] No longer deals bonus damage to shields at max stacks

Bladesurge (Q)
Minion damage changed from [Deals double damage to minions] to [Deals 45/60/75/90/105 bonus damage to minions]

Vanguard's Edge (R)
wall damage increased from 75/125/175 to 125/200/275
slow potency increased from 60% to 90%
wall duration lowered from 2.5/3/3.5 to 2.5 at all levels
[Removed] No longer disarms enemies passing through the wall
Epic.

those random battles changed you
jett you have a furret problem
some quality pokeposting
10/10
but you don't get as fucked if she starts chimping out
well I mean she can still die and the cd is longer
until death that's p good
xDDDDDDDDDD
and nerfed the dmg and cd
So they removed the 60 seconds thing
The version that we're going to try out tomorrow is: 
Maiden lives in the world permanently and follows you by default
After some period of time you can choose to recast R to set her free to roam down a lane."
already nerfed!
xD
 [Yorick has extensive changes in testing on the PBE!]
Eulogy of the Isles (R)
Cooldown increased from 120 at all ranks to 180/140/100
Vs. Live: from 160/130/100 to 180/140/100
Maiden bonus attack damage changed from 10/20/30 to 0/20/40
Max health damage on Yorick attacking Maiden's target lowered from 4/7/10% to 3/6/9%
Vs Live: from 5/7.5/10% to 3/6/9%
until late game, I mean
so the total uptime will probably be about the same, if not better if you get ganked/lose a fight
but your ult is also just gonna be on a lower cd
does it take that long to solo baron?
1% reduction is w/e
means you can solo baron when it spawns lol
for the auto attack % health dmg
the fact that his ult no longer has a cd
anything is possible
they did release original ap galio though
no way they wont
they'll see his winrate spike up by like 200000% on pbe right
theyre definitely gonna revert some of this shit
you played a dog champ to plat
at all
you might get diamond off this shit wouldn't be surprised
its true tho
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
but Michael and I can join in on the cancer
itll be bad
is fucking dumb

old would've been broken and I like broken :)
still not a great asol buff though

He also noted a changelist for Aurelion Sol:
"Yo, wanna clarify. the full change is
Recast Min Time :: 0.65s &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.25s
Q CC duration :: 1.1 / 1.2 / 1.3 / 1.4 / 1.5 &gt;&gt;&gt; .55 - 1.65 / .6 - 1.8 / .65 - 1.95 / .7 - 2.1 / .75 - 2.25
Q now obeys minimap targetting (E already did) 
With X as the old stun duration, the stun duration scales linearly from (0.5x to 1x) at outer ring if you stand still, then linearly from (1x to 1.5x) over 5s total. Turns out snap cast Q with old stun values was nuts powerful. I do wonder how far we can push the extra stun duration on larger stars, but I'm gonna settle for putting in a tuning lever for future iteration for now."
its your time for diamond
michael
Yorick
Shepherd of Souls (Passive)
Yorick's ghouls no longer deal reduced damage when they are far from Yorick.
[Ghoul health bugged per Riot Maple Nectar!]

Maiden health changed from [700/1500/4000 (+30% Yorick's health)] to [300/1000/3000 (+70% Yorick's health)]
[New Effect] "After 60 seconds, the Maiden will break free from Yorick and proceed down the closest lane. Yorick can set her loos prematurely by reactivating the ability."
While following Yorick, The Maiden will leash back to Yorick if he moves 900 unites away from her.
Max health damage on Yorick attacking Maiden's target lowered from 5/7.5/10% to 4/7/10%

its all about the economy in the end
disco was meant for dancing
and the purpose of their creation is different
to anyone that isn't religious and white

its uplifting
disco is sick

yea
im not sure how much black culture has evolved though
70's80s
its also based in the 70s

SL
that explains a lot
I didn't even know jojo had female characters
whos the thot
LUL
4
xDDDDDDDDDDDDD
from 0
so he wins the game if he lands it last stock
always
but he dies 2nd
it does kill chrom too
either at the ledge or offstage
if you land it on the ledge too
you win the game
from 0 if you land it offstage
no lol
literally 0
it kills you at 0
his up b is cancer
in smash hes just homo
100%
as a character I like chrom better
because hes so fucking op
chrom is gayer roy
roys sick
and marth has his new one
well, he has the melee marth neutral b
he has a different neutral b
Edited previous message: nah that was one of the moves that stayed the same
nah that was on of the moves that stayed the same
now hes only half marth
roy got reworked in smash 4
no hes roy
chrom is roy but good
but at least I only play chrom
nope its fucking retarded
luckily I climbed out but it was cancer
and people who are stuck in elo hell get nothing but free for alls
you cant even switch characters when fighting the same person
the connection is fine, they just had monkeys design it
ok smash ultimate is good but holy fuck the online is bad
right
at least latino studies is braindead
goodnight fellas
so I couldn't be happier
my boy chrom is looking like the best character in the game too
can confirm smash ultimate is god tier
btw guys
xd
L9
cx
yea
sometime
and play mine
you come over
how about
slightly better than tekken, but I also don't love tekken
but either way, after watching some smash ultimate day one stuff, it looks incredible
but I guess those aren't graphical complaints, just game feel complaints
so its def worth it
but it makes for good gameplay
the characters are so stiff and the movement looks jank visually
imo they look really bad
Edited previous message: but the in game combat is near perfect
but the in game-game combat is near perfect
tekken is good but the graphics/general feel of the game are dogshit
all hd and solid
or something
they have like a thousand songs
all of smash's music is very good this time around
rn
hes going through loss
its amazin
ur loss lol
or getting a friend to give them a hard copy from gamestop
like by buying it on the Australian eshop
yea but only for people who cheesed it
I just bring autism anyways
it shouldn't be too hard
gl
of no me
4 days boys
100% smash bros
today tomorrow and the weekend
Michael im sorry but
u fuk
don't direct a shadbase link at me
sweet
background/foreground xd
it can be hard to follow whats even going on sometimes
otherwise its underwhelming lol
looks kinda cool
from faceless void
nah chronosphere or w/e its called
but getting the stun is the hype part
while theyre stunned
but it mostly involved auto attacking someone down
ive seen some hype plays in dota
LUL
it was overtuned
which proves
and nerfed funneling
glad they removed banner at least
HMMMM
&gt;banner
&gt;funneling
"why is our viewership falling"
as fuck
that's L9
banner of fucking command
banner for another 4th
1/4th the year
there was funneling for like
dude this season in league
i think what he meant was that it only happened every so often
we were really just referencing yogg meta
tell him new plan
never work
is bad
no
argue with woman
he save
if he love mom
he sell
if your dad hate
they do that
wow is worst game world
game isn't out yet
LMAo
they did that
eric
they are
someone else could take over
and if it somehow does
yea
xd
isn't that ur whole point
hes dead
so its L9 as fuck
but the genre died
really good
dead
eventually gatcha games
dead game
pocket god
dead game
angry birds
think about it
by any means
it doesn't mean its eternal
eventually that market may become undesirable
yknow
i like this one
"I am too good
and they‚Äôll make ganes"
it was a gr8 mobile game
for when it came out
good mobile games make more money
if you want money
making a good game is your job
same as riot
blizzard got lucky with a good game
comparing yourself to a professional game developer
youre a 3rd year in college
they aren't old enough
eric they obviously aren't ready to make games yet
yes he will die
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
eric how did your argument turn into "sakurai will eventually die so im right"
Edited previous message: the online comp mode has an items version
the online comp mode has an items versions
so long as you're queuing for that mode
but in smash ultimate you can finally choose to play competitive with items
and appeases them
but he knows his fans
sakurai wants smash to be a game with items
which sucks
id be down for a bracket with items, but theres too many elitests
tbfh
id play ranked aram over ranked 3s
maybe
yea lol
for a while now since urf
ranked aram has been the most requested gamemode
people are actually asking for it
we'll see
i mean
so we'll see whats up
but that's the thing with ultimate, there isn't technically a standard gamemode for once
bc that isn't the "standard" gamemode
it definitely limits the ability to join the competitive scene
yea that's a fair point
it really depends
aram takes stuff away
urf adds stuff
but really just 2
technically like 5
league has 2 modes
that's how a game should be
theres 2 modes
I love yogg!
but its a competitive 4fun4 party game
4fun4
I mean, its ultimately a video game
and its a card game
s1 hearthstone was somewhat good
and imo best hearthstone competitive season was s1
fine vro
since day 1
and it was designed to be casual
hearthstone is still a competitive esport to this day
thanks auto response
which is the only reason why im hyped for it
ultimate is the first smash game to be designed to be competitve
L9
smash ultimate
best chrom in the world
gimme 2 days
get better pro : )
idk man
trolling

I missed that
oh

xd
At least he got his point across well, credit it to him
xd
Im so glad Anthony Fantano is there to spread his philosophical views with us
so epic
xdddddddddd
from canada
annex all asians
but those attributes are replaced with kindness and understanding
canadian white women are like American white women without the thottiness and attitude
and leave all the salty Canadian men there
we should steal their women
Canada has had it too good for too long
cant deny that
tho
the interviewer seems like she has an agenda
seems good man
love when chat gets hidden randomly
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
its back
insecure + dick = no me gusta
but he looks insecure
he seems like a dick
after watching him for 1 minute
I don't like Jordan Peterson either
srsly
why would they do that tho
xd
So a dead platform is going to lose its main users?
30%
I hate
xd
instead of soon

mars wanna play some absolver
the boys from the yard might say otherwise
or at least, multiple
so that way we have a bunch of winners to retell the tale
yea
xd
see a quad sector battle royale
I wanna
oohhh
but what if we make it a multisector battle
now that's an investment
and an arena
just buy like 10 sets of swords
lmao
gl then
hmmm
might wanna lower your system temperature if you're trying solutions out
nm I can do about it
but I know my laptop gets hot
that happens to me infrequently
xd
i believe it
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
LMAO
xd
and thats terrifying
honestly im not sure if i believe in the death penalty in a country like America anymore, it could probably be very abused if normalized
i know it was back in the 60s
is that still common today?
Conversion to islam
b/c thats the only real reason to ever consider using the death penalty imo
killed them the way they killed the person they murdered
what if we just
i think our whole prison system needs a reform
yup
that was probably a heavy question
I said I do and I think that changed a lot
did you put that you do or don't believe in the death penalty
:thinking:
damn the odd one out
only when im in decay

if I had fat stacks

so he helps keep the community thriving
hes passionate about streamers and video games
idk man donating is about passion
hahaha
drops big bucks
he donates like 50k sometimes

I think it helps offset the cost
yea
he donates a ton of money to other streamers
but I think hes already rich, thats his whole thing
its degenerate thats for sure
thats what fame does
that's what fame does mars

well I guess jglers are gonna take the armor
IMO
and the scaling hp decision is a good one
and the towers give more gold
except every character has a bit more scaling hp
it almost felt no different

ok real patch notes
check em out if you want

found a low red image of the patch notes
that's why its so shitty looking
oh her e is actually a root
theyre just both vastayans
instead of "nami is a fish person and wukong is a totally separate evolved form of monkey"
b.c they finally made a word for animal/human hybrid
theyre really pushing this whole vastaya thing
are furries into lizards? :thinking:
and she'll be the best jungler
or they'll randomly buff her q by 50 damage per tick if she sucks
that's probably whats going to happen
i don't want to imagine that in my league games
reads like aids
don't say it like that dude
its like lb passive
i don't think she gets stealth
if riot changes the numbers to work for it
anything is possible
Taliyah is a jungler
and her q seems like a low cd
dodging an auto is decent
if her w can tank camps idk
doesn't ring support
that's very unreliable
outside of r
0 cc
or a bitchy mid
it seems like she might be a jungler
you mean the e
i felt the same way
ye
yea that's why you need a malphite or somethin
then even if her kit sucks she'll probably just one shot you
b/c riot does that with all their new champs
well the numbers are also gonna get buffed if she sucks
like malphite r or amumu r
but needs a first engage
the ult seems like it could be strong
nah her kit seems decently okay
gonna be hard to play
yea
in bursts
its more like an accelerated morgana w
kinda? i guess
kind?

eric wow you saw a reddit leak or smth
???
and they just gave up
like those zoe changes they said they were working on just fell flat
and play vs the cancerous bs that actually needs changes
you only understand that shit when you play a lot of league
at least in the past
but they don't understand when problems start and definitely put a stop to them too slowly
the argument they've always used is that you don't need to be high elo to see numbers and trends, which i definitely agree with
who just plays a lot
half the balance team is worse than some rando
damn that's crazy
i guess that im better than half the balance team
so idk why im talking
and in a lot of people's eyes im low elo as fuck
theres no point
but idk why I went there
idk halfway through this conversation I tried to figure out a way to help low elo players
so that's why they don't try
I guess that low elos are just impossible to save
so maybe theyre doing something right
but that's also balancing around high elo?
but they leave them hard as fuck and just nerf them
but I think that riot should bridge the skill gap for those champs and nerf them at the same time
yea that's the case currently
well, they still play yasuo and lee in this meta
but high elo players don't touch them unless theyre meta or one tricks
that's why so many silver players still play zed yasuo and lee sin
I was like that when I chose to play azir and asol
people are always going to play high skill champs b/c they want to feel like theyre better than other people
Edited previous message: to bridge the skill gap between high and low elo players
to bride the skill gap between high and low elo players
and nerf the attack speed he gets from 3 soldiers late game
no they need to buff his q cd back to what it was at level 1
so maybe its not good to jump the gun
although, he's starting to look a little bit better
so do something about it riot
azir is a bad pick at high elo tho
ryze is a good pick at high elo
that is the case currently tho
b/c if its broken at high elo it deserves a nerf
no I don't think its good for that to be the case either
i'd get the same results
so I might as well be on the balance team
but those people are hired to know what to do, and still dont
but tbh, I wouldn't know exactly what to do with most of the complicated champs in league
if their job depends on it
and any decently intelligent person can get silver in league
and not actually league players
I remember they said something about it once, but im assuming its because those people are more or less statistics people
for some reason
and a few silvers
its mostly mid/low diamond players
but only a single player is master tier, and he just got it this season playing nothing but velkoz
the balance team should really be made of master tier players
but now he's a shell of what he once was
well they got it right with the ryze root after all this time
and they choose to nerf everything else about them
every high elo player knows whats op about ryze and azir
but they just cant so they don't know how to balance them IMO
they wouldn't be so hard to balance
like if they could actually play ryze/kalista/azir at a decent skill level
b/c theyre all trash
with a champ that they cant even play
so it really shows they have no fucking idea what theyre doing
but then he was pick ban in competitive after these buffs settled in a few patches later
and I think I would've been fine with that
if they never rebuffed him he'd have probably never been changed again
V5.5
General
Attack speed increased to 0.625 from 0.6.
Soldier attack range increased to 375 from 325.
Spear pass-through range decreased to 50 from 100. Total range unchanged.
but then they buffed him and he was decent
and you've fucked a champ over
and remove 50 damage off his burst
but take that on azir whos a dps mage and has to constantly reposition his now shitty w range
would be dogshit
but also somehow gutting her tower damage
and 75 collision radius on leblanc w
imagine nerfing 50 base damage off leblanc q
that wasn't a rework
where they gave the hardest nerf to a champion in league of legends history
V5.3
Conquering Sands Conquering Sands
Base damage reduced to 65 / 85 / 105 / 125 / 145 from 75 / 105 / 135 / 165 / 195.
Arise! Arise!
Soldier range decreased to ~325 from 400.
Tooltip corrected to (+ 70% AP) from (+ 60% AP)
Damage to tower reduced to (50 + (10  √ó  level) (+ 40% AP)) from (90 + (15  √ó  level) (+ 70% AP))
then they didn't nerf him until 5.3
but 15 damage on q made him pick ban
idk how
if they never went through with this buff he wouldn't have been such an issue
that buffed azir's early q damage and make him complete cancer
this is the patch, patch 4.20
Conquering Sands Conquering Sands
Base damage increased to 75 / 105 / 135 / 165 / 195 from 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180.
Arise! Arise!
AP ratio reduced to (+ 60% AP) from (+ 70% AP).
Shifting Sands Shifting Sands
Shield increased to 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 from 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220.
I can show you where riot went wrong
maybe
used to be 400
the soldiers have a range of 375
what
Edited previous message: it was also reduced by an additional 25 before, from 825
it was also reduced by an adition 25 before, from 825
Soldier command range reduced to 660 from 800.
azir used to :(
but the patch itself was fun
it set up league to become s8
than azir is
its pretty sad that pyke is significantly more viable as a mid laner
well they got compensated
nearly every mage did, though
maybe it was the best patch
azir only got nerfed once after his rework before that patch
it was good tho
no
definitely one of the two
No you
you know they'll buff her 7 times in a row until shes meta
and if she doesn't have stupid numbers on release
gonna have stupid numbers
you'll just die too
so if you turn into an adc
im assuming this champ is made out of fucking paper
yea something like that lol
menacingly
that just walks at people
like when you're cloning a fucking darius or something
it'll probably be useful sometimes
xd
that's completely unbelievable
why would you transform into them
your team
throw us all for a loop
maybe shes only 5 yrs old
whatever that means
she looks like shed be a normal aged chameleon girl
i really hope that isn't her
nidalee but always a furry
and that item from black market brawlers
isn't that kinda based off a dota champ
but is it really tho
which surprises me
apparently people actually like her
indeed
season 4 the gamemode
its true
voice design gameplay counterplay
nothing about her is worse than zoe
like
its not as bad as zoe
x fuckin d
neeko
up
look
that ult is amumu ult with a delay
without her passive making her another champ
I think the worst part about her is that she just looks broken
they just do it
Theres nothing saying they need to give them anime eyes
FeelsBadMan
i wish riot would stop making weeb champs
I think he did
the cuntmeleon

crits

Virgil could change artifact to play at an even slower pace
if you don't know virgil you don't know life
lol.
:'(
as were chester and brooj
virgil was a good friend last night
i think its decent as rng standards go tho, at least when the crits are out of 10 and not out of 100
more times than I can count
I have been abused by critical strike chance
the rng looks aids at times tho
at least
yea but its cool
or the beach and praying

Im thinking neutral evil based on descriptions
but the displays in session one really set a tone, especially when left unchecked
yea of course
just when you assess the characteristics alone it looks chaotic evil
miles actually, the website seems to say hes more of a lawful good turned lawful evil
Edited previous message: for the purposes of the game
for the purposed of the game
just based on source material he's chaotic evil
Good characters and creatures protect innocent life. Evil characters and creatures debase or destroy innocent life, whether for fun or profit.
well hmm
Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall short of their duties.

Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do what they promise if they feel like it.
I think lawful evil is a good fit after this discussion
^
almost all of them see themselves as them being in the right
yea but a lot of evil people don't view themselves as evil
or by the truth
so is alignment determined by how one sees themselves
yea but that isn't true
to me
which is just really surprisng
yea but you disagree with everyone
Michael and miles agree with me, so does parsa
but only he would see himself as good IMO. Everyone else would see him as evil
so I do agree with you on that
I mean, I get the idea of a zealot paladin working by his faith alone and massacring all that he deems unworthy based on his own morale compass
and dar wasn't gonna stay lawful good
and didn't kill him
kormin was neutral
yea but
yea its so rare to see someone disagree with the source material based on technicality
you got into the same argument with him
and agree with it
I just don't get how you don't see what I mean
hes shown hes evil imo
by intentionally killing a fellow member of the army which is grounds for dishonorable discharge and jail time nowadays
but mostly neutral
or evil
that's what neutral is
but you killed him based on results
chester did nothing with the intention of being evil
is what I was trying to point it
but far worse
I mean, your character did that
b/c he annoyed you
yea you literally killed your brother in arms
he said there were dead lizardmen in a portal of blue light
you never even visited the altar that chester told you about
idk man
when the purpose of summoning it was to destroy others
which is why the lizardmen wanted them dead
and continued that belief after they admitted to summoning vanu bora
when he said that he's allying with the pygmies WITHOUT meeting them
no we see that his intentions were corrupt
or I guess just don't pick lawful good
you're expected to murder
extremist lawful good
that's like
especially when the pygmies showed hostility towards them and said they summoned vanu bora
well, to kill an entire population based on assumptions is at worst evil and at best neutral
you just assmed they were conquerors
but you never asked how the lizardmen lost their home
that's pretty easy to say after the fact
uh
his intent was corrupt tho, on the way to the pygmies he said "we obviously ally with the pygmies because theirs more of them"
you don't genocide people you barely know if you're good, you try to solve it diplomatically
and doesn't understand what it means to be good
look dude, if you're trying to say what sachael thought he was doing what a good person would do then he's definitely evil
yea so you were supposed to ally with the pygmys which was the plan
they said "get us poison so we can kill the lizards"
so did the pygmys tho
and you wanted to side with them because there were more of them
the pygmys admitted to being in a war
well it wasn't a genocide, it was a war
you then said you were going to do it to the pygmys
you jeopardized the safety of the entire party and the lizardpeople who saw you as potential allies to eradicate them bro
for evil intentions
b/c hes literally doing everything that an evil person would do
just making him change alignment
I mean listen, im not punishing your character for anything he's done
especially people in your army
you cant kill people and get away with being good
its cool tho we needed an evil PC
sachael is definitely evil
uh huh
I made sure he didn't do anything directly evil
because he was innocent
in this case, yes
there were 20 boats
we established that
so hes a coward
you guys jumped on his boat as he was leaving
if you dispose of an innocent person for being a liability, that's evil
but he was innocent, just a coward
nobody else seemed to mind him coming back, not even dar who took first watch
ok but to be fair, it seemed like only you wanted him to leave
LMAO
everyone in here is in the dnd chat
well actually
I didn't see this was the normal one
lets take this to the dnd chat from now on tho
it was just unlucky
if you do something with the intent of being good then you're not evil if it fails
at least, for alignment in dnd, intent matters more i'd say
100%
mhm
but on the island you were "good"
well you did try to steal from the captain, so you're still neutral
if anything gael is becoming more good than neutral
for long*
not yet, but dar wouldn't have been lawful good if he was still alive
if his playstyle continues chaotic evil for sure
Based off last session, sachael is chaotic good
I did that last time too
Edited previous message: Or we can make people like sachael who have caused significantly more chaos for selfish reasons than the rest of the party reflect that in their alignment

Chester: Rowed the boat away from you guys, got captured by the lizardmen. Was attacked by a squid monster (which could've been one of the actual party members instead)

Sachael: Lied to the lizardmen about the worm, causing them to become your enemies. This then caused them to rain javelin fire down at the party, knocking down gael. Thunderous smited the ground where the worm lives, which resulted in the death of a lizardman and Dar. Directly killed Chester, and sent him out on an impossible task.

Gael: Got into trouble with the captain, which, if played incorrectly, could have led to the party getting in trouble.
Brooj: Did not report a flying snake to the party.
Dar: Initiated combat with the worm which led to it chasing you. Died for his actions.
Kormin: Assisted in waking the worm using thaumaturgy.
might have to change that alignment
seems like a chaotic evil sorta thing to do
idk man
but he was unconscious
definitely accurately represents the situation you were in
that's quite the way to put it
O O F

damn he died a year ago
unlucky

only part of the music video I thought was amazing
that won her for me
it was just that one scene where she was between the trains
but everything else is good.
we can differ on the 1st place

that's what im saying

its like
but if you're at 90% health

up to 30, based on missing health
that its now missing health

and nut when I download smash ultimate
im gonna try to last until December 7th
I think that's good enough
December.
no nut November lasts until when Michael?
this is no nut november
but this isn't a 1v1
at first I thought "yea why not sounds fair"
or can they nut without consequence
does your opponent need to hold their own till the end of the month
if you nut before your opponent
YIKES
no matter what
you definitely deserve the punishment
you fucking suck
if you nut during nnn
I was wrong
you know what mars

I don't really have an issue with it

Brooj es numero uno
gud song...vro
Nor did i
kinda

no
LOL
the 3 peat
I hate
yuh
but i smiled at the end b/c it got me
its definitely fake
it multiplies
mixing two groups of autism = more autism
its consistent
you get advanced autism
when dota and anything meet
you get turbo autism
so when league and anime mix
it reaches a new stage
when you mix two types of autism together
i can agree with that
girls
its a string of anime gilrs
is aids
no that one
ok
a lot of effort went into it and it paid off
that was pretty good
so making a meme of it is just normie
but that scene was intended to be funny in the first place
but very little is new
well, that's not true actually
nothings new to me anymore
im like a meme grandpa
yea so its still funny to them
which means the whole culture is just degenerate
but the issue starts when you realize that normie memes are just oldschool edgy memes
yea
i didn't get that far the first time
i rewatched it
oh
to me, at least
but the idea of this being real is funny
whatever he was doing on screen wasn't funny
that's insane
furry tick tock memes AHHHHHHH
please god no
that show came out as a meme
the penguins of Madagascar TV show is a meme michael
i can respect that
it fit all the criteria to be cancer gj
that was cancer eric lmao
ok
and that makes them gold
nono the early ones are real
but theyre still solid
or, if not fake, exaggerated
a lot of them are fake now tho
greentexts are still pretty solid
rather than just cringy youtube videos and holleywood movies like normal memes
the thing about anime memes is that theyre "relatable" and actually has new content to thrive off of
but nothing special
the deep fried woman is aight
that's pretty good with how inflated the industry is nowadays
yea
i like the dog saying show your asshole, i like the red dead one, and i respect the duck one
:)
but its just another amy schumer joke readapted to a new format
moreso than a good idea translated into meme format
but it seems like was created to fit an era of memes
its okay
but not funny
the lemons give you life one is aight
the George bush one is almost something
theyre all pretty normie for their respective demographics
uh
Edited previous message: I want to see whats in circulation
I want to see what in circulation
like show me a meme michael
they are indeed
js
and i'll roast it
right now
give me an example
the fortnite dancing people expect their audience to laugh with them
theres a difference between laughing at something and laughing with something
Yea
and not interesting
so they are therefore "normie"
Most memes pretend to be ironic, but are often times just their creator's style of actual humor
just a normal way
but not in an ironic way
Last year I realized memes were just getting more autistic
That's why I dipped early
1998-2004

nobody actually likes mike meers
-Mike Meers
I'm deleting face book Instagram and all my other social media accounts so if you really wanna chat ask Me for my # cause I'm tired of all the bullshit on social media and all the fake friends who can't fucking reply to a simple "hey" I'm done trying to make friends I'm done so like I said if you really wanna chat then ask me for my phone number
That conversation is what science thinking was derived from
lul
to speed up the checkpoint
and try
we can spam honor you
we must honor you
They're too gay
No women in my campaign
That makes them inherently gay
Homosexuality means to be attracted to one of the same. If women's X chromosomes are attracted to other X chromosomes
So, if one sucks a dick, does that not make them gay?
Are they gay now?
I thought traps weren't gay
I said gays michael

You could challenge jett or your boy digbo
Are you gonna challenge someone else michael?
So if eric is too chicken
i hope

since he challenged you
you get to make a wager with parsa tho
i think Michael already did
ok that's not that bad
level 20 btw
(mars this is your chance to get parsa to play absolver)

i think
Its up to eric to decide
Or get enough shrooms to elicit some joy (we can pay you back)
Play league with me till your eyes bleed
Values of each:
your choice, of course
Fine Miles, if you fail, you either have to play league with me or get some shrooms for the boys
I like that
YIKES

b/c you're so random LOL XD
to the group chat
you gotta give some bullshit speech over text
If you wanna take part
aight
are you gonna no shave November too
hell yea
or none of us should
we should all do it
if you're doing it i'll do it
are you thinking about it
hol up
you guys remember this shit
i'll definitely try it out
that's so strange
huh
wtf
oh
cool
ohh
its on friday
jett clash isn't today actually
we're all brainless players
again
so the servers don't die
so theres less people
hes honor locked
eric cant play
I guess
its tonight at 5
im p sure
they chose tonight b/c less people would be playing on halloween
yea was just wondering
but im down to lower it
im tier 1
who wanna join clash tonight
that isn't intentionally dumb
is this the dumbest video
vs good challenger players
even challenger players are garbage
I feel you vro
im still d5
LMAO
b/c you definitely get to corner combo
its hard to explain over text tbh
I cant pull them off
and they have sparking
you can die from getting hit once if you get hit in the corner
just not when you're button mashing they dont
trust me
they definitely do
b/c when bitches swap they wont get their hp back
which would lower overall kill time
there shouldn't be any regen
yea I agree with that
if you're better you win
at least, competitvely
but that's what they did right in a sense
while getting bodied
that you can think about your defensive option
the combos take so long
yup
with any kind of delay
and it does punish buttonmashing but its way too fucking hard
only vanish
theres not even dodge in dragonball
yah vro
while not having to play dragonball
will this game make me better at dragonball
while playing a mid tier
I care so I can complain
learn the basics
so ill start it up
ook ook
so I can fuck you up
rq
you gotta teach me absolver
when do you get back from work
makes way more sense
oh its khalt
they flipped it
lmao ofc
people say forsaken &gt; kahit &gt; windfall/stagger
style tier list
mars what would your tier list be
Terminology used in attack descriptions   
Cis Hits on the same side as the stance (i.e. in front-left stance, hits on the left).  
Trans Hits on the opposite side as the stance (i.e. in front-left stance, hits on the right).  
Advantage Refers to the relationship between the attacks recovery animation and the stun it inflicts on the opponent. Google it if you're unsure.
LMAO
trans
cis
wtf the types of attacks in absolver are called
that's kinda cool
it has ori and shovelknight tho
and that's b/c its furry dogshit
theres a reason I don't play rivals
xd!
b/c everyone is so close
apparently rivals of aether doesn't have a tier list
5!
so 5
well and jigglypuff in melee
which is honestly impressive for how annoying top tiers usually are
he did well with the rest
so -4 characters
and meta knight and ice climbers
except in the case of dlc smash 4 characters
sakurai is really good at making top tiers tho
xD!
instead of nerfing her weight
how about we remove that
bayo is op b/c she can kill you from 0?
sheik is op? how about instead of nerfing fair by 1% we make the move have real ending lag
and do the exact opposite
id just use all my knowledge of what riot has done
:^)
like me
he should've hired someone to take over for him
but honestly
he had to work on ultimate I guess
but the mechanics of the game just helped some characters way more than others
I feel like he learned a lot from smash 4
see that's the only thing im worried about
and not doing nothing*
when im not playing league*
Edited previous message: imma play absolver with you all day every day
imma play absolver with you al lday every day
also mars, if smash ultimate sucks
super Mario rpg
he says it in the video
and he wa sin it
there was a leak that looked super convincing for once
I don't like geno but I think he'll be confirmed on thursday
so im hyped
and it is apparently 10x worse than ultimate
but smash 4 was the 4th most popular fighting game for the last 4 yrs or smth
there is bias
yes, obviously
and if parrying is as good as it seems or not
it depends on if rage is in the game or not
melee might still be better competitively though
s
and the airdodge/roll system rewards good players rather than spammer
and they all say the movement in that game is fucking godlike
theres been numerous playtesters
smash ultimate will probably be the best fighting game, in terms of mechanics, in the last 10 years
unless they buff azir
that's about as hype as i'll get until dec 7th
boys theres a smash ultimate direct on thursday
riot games

itd make sense to sell them together, but I doubt 75 bucks would get you both of them from riot
are they 75 each or together
I knew that tho
But still, you got this dude, keep up the healing
Well, maybe league isn't the best for depression lmao
I understand Diego, and I wish you the best on your path to recovery. Shit ain't easy but I believe in you. If you see me on league feel free to invite me if you're in the mood!
Wtf does this mean^

are you afraid they might break your dick, michael
using period blood
this is another version
A sexual act involving the period blood of the ladyfriend you've been plowing being placed on her forehead using your thumb. It is directly followed by you gently calling her "Simba".
have you ever done this mars?
in case there was any confusion
Sneaky Rafiki
While railing a girl in the ass, right before you are about to bust, take out your dick, and shove your thumb up the browneye. After the thumb is inserted, spit on her back causing her to turn around. As she is turning around to look back, pull out your thumb and glide it across her forehead while reciting "SIMBAAAA" just like Rafiki from "The Lion King".
yikes
LMAOOOO
are you certain
I think weight surpasses most looks
but he could also get fucked by a chick

yes
so gays do care about looks?
i think he's talking about himself at this point
Michael are u kidding me
svens kinda good looking too

i gtg to dinner
kobe is intentionally put on the casting desk for his quality casting and clean slightly-above-average guy looks
LUL
its passing
7s are attractive yea
he's a 7 yea
deficio right
is that zirene?
He'd be the big boss
I know you mean bigger
He already is though!
like all tier lists
My tier list is to be taken at face value at the highest level of streaming
lol
I don't even know at this point
than attractiveness
That's why i placed them higher on my list
but that's one rare example
lily may have done it
its hard w/o makeup
[6:52:05 PM] Milo Amoore: While I agree, it is very hard to gain popularity as a female streamer without smart usage of makeup

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
I didn't say it was hard for women to be streamers i said:
I didn't say that
i didn't know what point you'd be trying to make if you were talking to me, is what i was going to say
ty
ok
if you're talking to me
david who are you talking to
is important
No i believe that skill &gt; attractiveness
Im aware
I know daivd
when she has people on
and a lot of it
but eric said she wears make up
so i don't know
No I don't watch lilypichu
at times
and a lot of it
She wears make up
Okay well i'm still right
im not wrong
she does
So
I heard you guys say she does
She wears make up now right?
its not wrong if i am not able to
b/c i cant
name one
who david
i may have fked that up
i think time might be after personality
you still need the time
but mars most of those guys haven't put in the time
^
I think it goes in order of this:
Personality
Skill
Attractiveness(female)
Time
Edited previous message: and isn't even good at him
and isn't even godo at him
only plays ww
toast is hot garbage at league
b/c they already had followings, of course
so does toast
well fed gets away with it
just as a face on twitter
kaceytron wasn't THAT popular as a streamer though
^
we just get to make women comfortable or smth
but we don't make the rules
men or women
i personally would be all for no make up in anything that doesn't have harsh light on one's skin
you know the difference
cmonBruh
well shes broadcasting herself Michael lol
she needs it or they'll be confused
but going to a job
a woman going to a farmers market doesn't need to wear makeup
some do! but a lot of working women need to wear makeup
and many other countries
Its a standard expected in America that's for damn sure
^
zoinks!
uploaded podcasts on youtube
It'd be better on youtube maybe
I think so too michael
that's for damn sure
Its easier to get initial recognition as a female
and im an average guy with little personality
with a good personality
that's because she's an attractive female playing games
you're not wrong
Its true mars
I didn't know about her 3 seasons ago
hol up
i don't think id forget this
when??
wtf
i never played vs poki
or eric
shes mechanically the same as like eric
d3 ok my b
no, the spleen
can I just poke at her stomach
I don't want to get shamed
Can I go second
HAHAHHA
MICHAEL
LMAOOOO
very degenerate character, but shes still good
supergirlkels is a very good sonic player in smash 4
Not saying its a terribly hard game to get good at, but shes good at it
and hafu is very good at hearthstone
Poki reached like d2 peak
I've seen some good female streamers though
yes
Not a natural born woman
Remillia was technically trans though mars
I mean poki definitely isn't bad at the games she plays
Exactly^^
in the streaming industry
I don't think they'd be doing if there was a reasonable alternative to success
large female streamer*
I cant name a single female streamer that doesn't use a lot of makeup, actually
While I agree, it is very hard to gain popularity as a female streamer without smart usage of makeup
just not our specific audience
She's doing to appeal to a wide audience, though
The amount of makeup she uses has always been a weird thing to me too
the light doesn't always reflect off her skin as well as it does in these 3 images
but to be fair those are very good pictures
I hard agree
im sure most of it was twitch chat being retarded but they were actually vicious
and no make up
this is how she looks w/ good lighting
damn did you guys see the backlash for pokimane going on stream withmout makeup
^^^
not sure

yea right
what does this guy think hes a fucking indian?
because shes epic.
i also like the gay vampire girl
wank wank wank
wank
but they don't swim
but they cant because theyre fat
they could swim back to shore
if they were fit
see
GET REAL
and cut the gas
why don't we just put them on a boat and send them out into the ocean
that sounds good too
hmmm
same here
and they get sent to jail for helping people evade taxes
if not, we fire them and hire better ones
and if everything works out we have a bunch of taxed fat people
give them guidelines
record them at the workplace
like we hire a couple hundred of them
that's why we have a highly paid official that works for the government undergo this job
if they look obese tax the fuck out of them
if they look fat, tax them more
i think it should be an eyeball sorta thing
or at least, a lot of people going out there and measuring fat people
that sounds like a lot of effort on our parts
someone who gets paid a very large amount
how about we have an official check them
same
Edited previous message: do we tax them anyways?
doo we tax them anyways?
sometimes thin people have high bmis
they even call these games the "Bot Olympics"
b/c that's too hard apparently
rather than ban them
riot's method to deal with bot accounts in league of legends is the detect them and queue them against each other
i believe it

yikes
i have prominent breasts what can i say

with no shirt on
then a fat guy

so its really is accomplished the same way
you can only ward the river brush if youre pushing tho
which helps me more than it hurts me, i just don't like that being the meta
and a lot of junglers don't even look mid they just do it and die
but now its the jungler who has to look mid and see if they can do crab
and risk getting ganked
in the old days you could let them push into you so theyd have to overextend
or else your jungler might be fucked and flame you
and that shoving level 2 is the only goal
i don't like midlane being decided by who can shove out level 2 fastest
i do and don't like it
I guess that's crab rn, but at least it doesn't give lvl 3
"just do krugs lol"
in terms of pathing
and have 0 skill expression
krugs level 3 was toxic for top laners on blue side tho
so theres actually something happening bot lane
and all the egirl support are out of meta
so you can actually do stuff as support
and they need mid more than ever
jgs don't gank bot lane as early anymore
since the scuttle changes
yea but it never felt as strong as it does now
as long as the adc can followup you're good
adc is support reliant instead
and support isn't even adc reliant
mid is super jg reliant rn
than 1v1 mid
its easier to 2v2 bot lane
yea
unless I pick asol
I feel like I have way more impact on support than on mid
???
and morning queues as asol
I like night queues as support
what a gal
shed be so happy
for racism, sexism, explicit language, and psychological damage
league is now rated R
yup
hard agree
for the most part
whenever
kids are all allowed to play
that's why i never play ranked on saturdays
and just int
they get home and play league
kids getting out of school
idk it comes with like
simply put
and theirs is the good one
because the games devolve into fiestas where my team is the bad one
then started losing when it went later
for a while
i too abused morning queues
morning queue god i see
or does riot just hate you?

yup

also true

i know qt likes it
tekken looks good too
outside of the character creation
it looks like a 20 dollar game

its something id almost buy

100%
yup

at different times
i don't think people should be coming out of paranoia
nono
for the rest of his kit
4 was too weak, admittedly
should be 5
lol
nocturnes winrate went up 4%
when they made it 6 seconds from 4
never seen an ornn that clean
his ornn ults were godlike too
licorice 1v9
YUP
its true
cmonBruh
to be considered a good player
even game 3 he didn't do enough
c9's team comp

he could be getting paid
think about it
is tusin wintrading?
&lt;3

it was our local trap
it wasn't trump

.
yes
LMAO
its time
and you missed like 4

i could do better as support
yo tousin is literally trolling
only reason to pick ahri
that was so dumb lol
LMAO
glacial augment looked so broken that fight
never forget the 3 ad
this is pre -3 ad nerf graves

sven's lead dude

maybe
mental reset
aatrox again LUL
sneaky in lane LUL
same
op when afk jg
on enemy team
champ sucks with good jg
with how that game played out
it would've been stronger
but then the jungler will camp you b/c you're fiora
unless you pick fiora
i think that's the only way to beat that champ
hard counters all melee tops
its apparently really strong in solo queue rn
especially tusin
but afreeca really aren't playing that well
i was gonna bet c9 was gonna lose the whole thing
theres a whole bo5 to play
was game 1
that
that's the inferior version
Get real

on karthus r
literally a 45 second cd
imagine ultimate hunter 40% cdr
wtf
that would break the game
they wouldn't make karthus r 100cd
on r
its mana cost
its not cd
realistically
that's why it only nerfs her roaming
yea
on average
yea by like 5-10
by a minimal amount
its not gonna do much except nerf her roaming
indeed they ar
indeed they are michael
so fuck that champ
really hurts my level 2 cheese though
I guess
too tanky baseline
since he never goes dring
I think its a healthy way to nerf him
been too high for too long
wr too high
but not all at once
ik gp got nerfed harder over 2 patches
in one patch
for base
is the biggest ive ever seen

Michael you'd be a good dm if you put the time into it
whats your idea miles
vro
...
where you become the rock
not doing some Jumanji shit
so they can still adjust the bells and whistles as they please
also, you could at lay out an archetype of the character for the player to follow
DR. PROF. UNK
tilted me so ahrd
team mom was so fucking gay
M'david
that's the real best reason for it IMO
which happens a lot and I am guilty of
it solves the issue where people make a character that's just themselves
good work auto response
of playable ones
definitely get to choose from the lot
I wouldn't assign it randomly tho
and class n such
not making the characters personalities, but their traits
this is something I thought of doing
if I were to ever run a campaign again
im a good summoner
wank

abt half
half of those characters are, at least
that's basically symbol font

I might try it and refund it if it doesn't work
I've seen aphromoo and boxbox play monster hunter just fine

time to wait for a patch

outside of lucian
but s4 had trinkets and better balance
s3 had better items and better objectives
yea
s8 is pretty good but the interest is all gone
slowly killed the game
when s5 tank meta
after that nobody gave a shit
and 2nd peak was September of s4
peak league interest was in September of s3
I looked at analytics

so moving power to e
im not sure actually
also easier to dodge in high elo
but
if anything its easier to hit in high elo than low elo
we'll see what they decide to do, but I agree moving power to e would be good
Edited previous message: or they might just nerf him
lol
or they might just nrerf him

I believe it
great game made by riot phreak!
yes!!
you can play league again

Failing to ban a champion no longer kicks you from champ select. This change went live during 8.13.
It‚Äôs a bit harsh to break up a champ select lobby on a missed ban selection, so instead, failing to ban a champion will default to ‚ÄúNo Ban‚Äù and champ select will keep on truckin‚Äô. Failing to select a champion for yourself will still incur a dodge.

yah
it looked good
right
OH
idk what ad you're talking about tho
this image speaks to me
Ive only met like 2 jessicas from samo
I feel like that isnt right
i didn't like his shit but i don't like the fact that he died
waiting for david...
vro i coming...
he liked him
i said rip to honor david bro
u right
my definition was a little off
i guess
i do
"saying"*
its called a :saying" b/c you don't exactly mean what you're saying
?
you coming through
david
when you coming over david
but that's another subject of debate
rip has kinda evolved from rest in peace
in honor of the dead
to give respect to the living
that's how i use it
imo
and is just a general acknowledgement that you offer condolences to his fans and family
has lost most of its meaning
i feel like rip in particular
to say rip
i guess my standards are lower than yours
but i respect that others liked it
i didn't like it at all
music I guess
rip my mans
bodies deserve peace
he contributed more than others and didn't cause more harm than good to my knowledge
meet me at my place
cool
w/ jett and i
together?
in like 5 minutes
wanna walk there
david
pepperoni boy
Rest in pizza

Mars doesnt know aaron
For $150
So he really hired a guy to break his lock
Aaron payed, but his lock was broken after that
Yea it was stupid expensive too
Thats a real sad scene
Thats what happened when this guy aaron had a party. We were all drunk at midnight in malibu at his place and got locked out for 2 hours and had to call a locksmith after attempting to pick it for 30 minutes
I just had to let everyone know
It was very very unfortunate

What time are we tryna do this on monday
 Y E S
Sure
Uti will be there too
For monday
But we can decide that when more people confirm so we have more to work with
I was hoping to go at like noon or one or smth
Mars tell your monday plans to fuck off
But im not against it
Well i was planning on doing that with him on monday, its even better because we can get miles too. But i wasnt planning on hanging with him outside of that necessarily
From san diego
On monday hes back
Uh well i wanted to go see it with uti
I hate...vro...bad scheduling...hahah...
Incredibles 2?
that's upsetting
???

Mods can be fun, really fun, just lost suck because they didnt have funding to make something thats a high enough quality for your standards

I got a smash 4 mod that added new colors for lucina based on other fire emblem girls
Sometimes theyre cool tho
I agree miles
Most people dont do that, only fiends
Well thats an extreme case
But i dont mind spending 10 minutes seaeching and downloading a resolution fix
I agree michael i wish i didnt have to mod games because of flaws
Very well thought out and a great game enhancer
But some mods like minecraft tekkit are great
Normally i just dont appreciate most mods becuase the people who make them dont make them to my standards
But its still a good game, i didnt mod the story or anything
Like i modded nier to get it to fit the 1920 by 1080 resolution just because the devs are stupid and didnt include it
Even when its great on console
Well sometimes the devs just made a terrible pc port
Because pc ports are trash sometimes
I think mods that fix framerate are great
But i dont replay stuff just because of mods
If you wanna play it again with mods then go for it
I feel like you shouldnt mod something the first time you play it
Yea exactly
And i guess skyrim but i never modded it
Me either michael, only minecraft which to me is the mid game
If a game needs mods it probably isnt worth playing as much as youre playing it
Or not playing it properly
It always makes me feel like im cheating
I dont actually like mods, it always detracts from my game experience unless that game is minecraft
I hate vro
That icon = good mid laner
I swear man its the icon
Im nasty what can i say
and its good!
so country is free

Writing about bs horse regeneration
Im just bored in class
So mundo is a super horse
Instead of regenerating flat health, he heals percentage health
Did you know that mundo is a special breed of horse
I lost to one in ranked
But horses are powerful.
Yea
Because the percentage doesnt matter as much as base health
Otherwise, you want as much as possible
It depends on how much you care about your horse regenerating
Overall, a horse always regenerates 5 x Level health per half second. But for every point of horsepower that a horse has, its base health increases by level x horsepower. Therefore, as a horse gains more horsepower, it loses efficiency on its overall percentage healing.
Overall, a horse always regenerates 5 x Level health per half second. but for every point of horsepower that a horse has, its bsse health increases by level x horsepower. Therefore, as a horse gains more horsepower, it loses efficiency on its overall percentage healing.
It loses efficiency when it becomes more powerful
The more horse power a horse has, the slower it heals.
It actually depends on their horse power
Yup
And it was pretty disguting before when you didn't buy it
Mars idk if you realize what they did to mundo. They increased his healing on ult from 60% max to 100% max at level 16. This means that with grievous wounds (40% healing reduction) on live, he'll heal for the same amount as last patch when he wasn't inflicted with grievous wounds.
But ita still gonna be broken level 16
Its a good nerf imo
Because theyre riot

I'm just reading the headline man
while trump is anti one trick
macron is trying to protect one tricks
you blind communist
you didn't even fucking read
ye
and gangplank is gonna die again
I'm personally not against that part of the idea
that shouldn't be a thing
b/c of how shitty the individual ranks idea is
this is only a problem
it forces players to learn new roles
just disable swapping in the new system i guess
oh i guess that's true
it swaps roles for you when you swap champions?
is pretty bad
but the solution you suggested
ik what you're saying the problem is
but i guess this does help your idea of keeping ranked competitive
i don't play a lot of ranked
me too lol
and continue to play it
for playing it
i guess their logic is that the border is for people who play ranked as a reward
it encourages consistent play i guess
i didn't love that change
ranked is shitty though
i don't though
ik people do
i don't like the gameplay
its not fun
and hate getting jg
since i play fill every game
i'd like that
I'm just saying
b/c you still want to be a good and useful teammate
like fill -1
i think you should be able to strike a role if you're playing fill
is not a good idea
the separate ranks bullshit
like I said before, I don't think this is a good change
Edited previous message: that very few people will enjoy
that very few people will enjo
but that's a very bad standard mode
called like "true elo" or some bullshit
it'll be cool if that were a separate queue
its an interesting idea, but that shouldn't be the ranked standard
before being frustrated
and wont have the time to learn every role
but they are realists, they know that players are not good at every role and will not have fun playing every role.
it just seems stupid to limit people in such an extreme way
I'm alright with that in theory
it'll reward the players that can play every role best yea
its not like your solution even fixes that
that's how its always been though
so its not like it really matters
most people with a voice*
to be low elo
and most people consider the elo you're in
yea rank is really unimportant
and people want to play the game for both fun and rank
its a game
dude you know
I guess you do
but who really cares about the ranked integrity of low elo league of legends
you aren't on the dev team
I'm so glad
that was the problem with the old system
so why would you care if you give up your role to a one trick
so you're a one trick?
knowing fully well they wont play well
your top is guilty for making them int too
so if you have a one trick on your team and your top says they wont swap with them
its up to your team to accommodate what your players play best
or they wont play your game
don't make people do what they don't want to
some players just do not enjoy playing certain roles
don't sacrifice the fun of players to discourage one tricking wtf
one tricking isn't a problem like you're making it out to be
it just makes you loathe your next game
I don't think that encourages anything good
if you're filled
b/c its not an autoloss
but you lose like 2% winrate at most by playing top a few games
ever
like maybe one game
in the old system I got away with playing adc
or something
but it should label you as a one trick
I don't really mind it lol
same as adc
mid was like 50 maybe 40
if you played top it was like 80
if you played support it was 99%
it depended on the role
so you'd get your role at least half the time tbh
role
and even in the old system people would still call their roll
rank doesn't really matter that much though
?
so maybe its faster? slower
but climbing will be a little bit different since theres only 4 tiers per rank
I was thinking the same thing
yea same
but I guess your autofill losses wont hurt as hard
you wont be able to play anything other than one role
not sure I love that one
yea right
we called them
on the car ride home from yosemite

I'm sorry eric : (
weird
Honestly its about time
how else can I tell everyone my april fools joke
@supereveryone is great
so like 3 weeks
this is all planned for 8.8
to be cooler
anything to change varus
for a long time
miles has been asking for this
varus w mini rework
Varus

A few of you might remember a change to Varus I talked about around a year ago that never ended up happening which would involve changing a bit of his kit's functionality. Was intended to ship around the same time as the addition of the Attack Speed ratio to his passive, ended up getting delayed repeatedly however because it needed visual effects/sound changes and other things were higher priority. We finally had a chance to get round to doing that art/audio work though, so will have that change in 8.8. That change is the addition of an active to his W that looks like this at rank 1.

Active: Varus' next Piercing Arrow deals bonus magic damage equal to 6% to 9% of the target's missing health (scales with Piercing Arrow charge). 40s CD. No mana cost.

Magic damage scales up to 12%-18% by W rank. It's still going through final balancing, so numbers aren't final. First goal is to ensure that, no matter what his build is, some of Varus's Q shots are still really impactful. Second is to offer an additional skill test, rewarding those who can call the shots that are both most important and likely to hit (long CD means you need to pick the right Q).

This change does add some power to Varus, so depending on where he ends up after the Rageblade cost increase in 8.7 might take a bit of power out elsewhere.
also, for miles
or jax or kha
no skarner nerf though &gt;: (
they said all the right names at the right time
"A Tahm Kench nerf aimed at giving opponents more ways to deal with him when he's saving allies."

"Well...you see professor" I say as the teacher prepares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. "I watch Rick and Morty." The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. "...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety." "Well you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!" One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who this fellow genius is. It's none other than Albert Einstein.

Unlucky as fuck
David nooo

Pegasus made this game to represent the truth behind the heart of the card!
Don't be ridiculous!
tell me
Dark magician best character
^
its godlike
Bro I know
same?
Yea voice is live i was using it with mars today
And skype enforces authoritarian reigns over the call
Discord cuts out though, which is pretty bad
Another downside to league voice is how big the audio adjusting tabs are when you hold tab
But its nice to not have to alt tab to adjust audio settings
But its nice to not have to alt tab to adhust audio settings
The main downside is that if you leave lobby you're done chatting
League voice is just discord with minor tweaks
one daaaaaaay acuvue oasis
HOLY
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
haHAA
She has the best model in the game without a doubt
but if you saw them theyre there
I didn't ever talk to them
maybe
: ^)
I just like aviator irelia ok fuck you idiots
half of the games you play your lanes aren't winning
but you can only do this if your lanes are winning
and then scales and one shots me mid
he just ganks better than every one of my teammates
its not really even about being to duel him
cancer champ
whenever I see a jax they gank top before my junglers even done with red
he clears really fast man idk
not he doesnt
and he'll fuck up a sej
jax can invade voli free
that's not a fair argument
that can be said for every jungler
no
but w/e
also incorrect
incorrect
he's a jungler
but jax isn't a top laner
so just out damage him
you just die
if you have cc
you just die
if you have no cc
how
b/c you cant outplay him
jax is cancer
nobody like playing vs him
he's cancer incarnate
azir is cancer tho
ez
just ult her out
when she ults you
its not about the dashes
in teamfights I mean
my counterpick is ready
with ult
he'll just cuck her
she seems like she'll struggle vs azir
: ^)
I like aviator irelia a ton but the face is a little too weeby imo
the torrent is well worth it
definitely not worth dropping 60 bucks
solid game
never played it but I watched someone else play it
15 is good
ooh
I really like her in game model's face, but I don't like the walk cycle
objectively its not great now but it was trash before
it was really bad
did you see the old one?
aviator is about the same
nightblade got buffed
that's all I got from this
they nerfed her skins a little
m em e em em eee
me me
me
you already know it
YIKES
he a gobbler looking ass fool
its L E A G U E O F L E G E N D S (cancer) time
but don't say team
I'm with it
queue
me hate que but I que anyways
fuck irelia
me main asol
good
we trying to beach dad it up?
whens your spring break
michael
ok
Shurima is eternal
when azir isn't trash

wtf a good critical video
tit jockey missfortune
even though it should've theoretically been harder
although, I didn't notice I had a really easy time last hitting on ahri today
basically
and equal to the 3 melees
its worth more than all 3 ranged minions
its kinda whack
well theres just so much gold on the cannon minion now
but increasing health is honestly okay
I don't think that changing the gold values is a good idea
runaan's hurricane instantly the most meta item
nor melee minions
I don't think that lowering the gold value of ranged minion is good though
she was fun
on pbe
so I played her
ahri got reverted
???
on pbe
I was playing this
yea
but its good for sieging
this isn't a good change imo
this explains it
"wtf why isn't my q one shotting the back line with ludens deathcap??"
and I was like
I played a game on ahri today
I NOTICED THIS
Its time to jam now
Get up
Sam
No.
Ill just respond with a no
Im here for you
Yoinks
For what, im too tired but i want to make you think im not
U wish
???
Fun game
19-5
I enjoyed my game as volibear mid
but the last one was half a sesh
i think we on 9 or so
can I be a captain with a speech impediment
can I play as an ultra marine named parsa jour
I'm gonna be a space marine xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
brock Hampton wants in
this is the circle of the well-knowing believers of brock hampton
me in
I second mars

We'll have one concluding campaign soon but then im passing the reigns over to a new campaign
Im honestly done with eluras for a while
and the xayah rakan skins could be good but its a coin flip
those are my favorites
I like the gnar and Taliyah ones
olaf is okay
nah
op
but wild west jhin
no me gusta
no lol
skt ryze is good
nah they kinda suck
theyre really good imo
for team skins

"I watch Rick and Morty." The class is shocked at my overwhelming intelligence. "...how? I can't even understand its sheer nuance and subtlety." "Well... WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!" One student laughs, and I turn to see who the fellow genius is. It's none other than Albert Einstein.
and why is it on cartoon frames
wtf is this
feel better man you got this, lifes being rough on you but you have to hold your head up high. whenever you're feeling down, your first thought should be to look right back up at what you care about most. feel better dude, lifes getting better every day you just have to ride the wave
yeee
yeee
damn
yee
everything else is good
yea
for the seconds I watched it
but it was beautiful
you get lucky sometimes and you win off it
yea, but that's hearthstone tbh
that was beautiful diego, I skipped through all of it and watched it for a total of like 6 seconds
I'm so surprised!
you rng'd him, like the deck is supposed to
oh

Notice the disgusting unformed calves of boys that have never worked a day in their lives and ankles that belong on a victorian era noble woman. The only pair of boots in the photo are suede and designer without a hint of mud or wear, the only bare foot shows a sole without a callus or sign of work ethic. These are not men, they are worthless untermensch to society and their families.
I thought it was somewhat straightforward

but yea you were totally reasonable, this guy was just salty as fuck

david what is that picture
Please dont post those weird animal face overs ever again
and obviously monkaS
oh
and its a replacement for yoinks
it combines yikes and monica
its my new invention
YONIKAs
you invented everything
but david invented it, so he must be recommending it to me for a good reason
that's my consumer opinion
probably shouldn't buy one
wow
outdoor
but how
I got that much
it claims its "water wet"
and he's stretching it
like pokemon
its called Pokelove
look carefully at it
please explain this to me
now I'm going to cyberbully him
i know his face
b/c I got a good screenshot
the internets greatest mystery has been solved
guys this is the face of vvvvvvvvvvortic
eyy
Even if you miss her skillshots
That's a lot of damage in a team fight or all in
The w buff makes her really consistent tho
At least they removed more sparkles damage on q so they can do more refined balancing in the future
Those zoe buffs arent that cancerous
I*
Ill play with you guys tomorrow or when o get back home
Thx man
Or did michael use it?
You
Ill take from yoy
Vro senf the code my way...
Ohhh
I wanna meet that dad

lf 29:99 for vermintide 2 with a cool drink on the side
Acceptable
Ah
not only vermintide shall be request
that was basically my amendment
All in favor say "Aye"
Vermintide, while popular by some accounts, is not the only game that shall be requested to be played
I would like to propose an amendment to this new law
Aye
^
we're best friends!
YIKES
and we don't know what to do with him to help
it just means parsa's bored
but since it doesn't mean league anymore
team is wayyy too vague to make anyone want to do anything
idk try saying something else
you're the only one who says team anymore
I don't really like the simpsons
or like its in a dark alley waiting to jump you
it kinda looks like a ghost
its so poorly drawn
yea that's what I'm getting
alright whos is better
pretty good huh
the bottom image was my reference
yikes
4.4k dpi actually
exactly what I'm doing
uh
thats
looks much better now
I did the ears
yea the 1st one for sure
its really just the quills that are different
which version looks better
guys I'm doing a sonichu drawing competition with jimmy
just report them if they do
hmm
"Trully the best relationships between gamedev ~ players ! xD &lt;3"
Look at this sentence I found
wanna duo?

DBFZ is the true master race
it was a good play
ye
you know I had to do it to em
was at dinner
unlucky timing
ye
stopwatch nerf lets go
but it seems better now
its just a cancerous game
and id rather not spend the money
the movie just seems underwhelming so I didn't see it
but honestly
its just not possible
so I CANT see it
I don't see color
Michael I don't think you understand
but if I don't see it, am I racist? :thinking:
no
they aren't racist, they made lucian
riot probably gave black panther a 10/10
hell yea
we were probably playing against the small population of black league players
and the enemies reported you
sets all the flags off
spamming it that many times
michael
yikes, they sure know how to treat vets
yop
ive not played league for like 2 weeks
same
:^(
yea something like that
not that teammate honors matter too much
I always give you tilt proof unless you feed
and she'll be fine
just someone that can slow/hook
thresh even
braum support
tahm support
have a blitz support
or uh
and we'll see
give her a few more days
maybe idk lol
Kai'sa?
I'm lost
wait what
just better in every way
she's hard but good kinda like yas
you press q again and it does true dmg
you wait 1.5 seconds
the way it works is you press q
ye
on her q
Neither is Camille's, its just one auto
Braum
Truly outlandish levels of originality
Its even better when your abilities apply the mark too
^
.
soldiers are men
commoners are men and women
^
in times of peace men go up, in times of war women go up
its unreal
like
childbirth killed so many women
so did women
b/c you aren't fighting children
yea but commoners probably contain somewhat mostly adults
or 8
and a woman probably 9
but the average for a male in dnd is probably 12
so the average is probably 10
well commoners do take into account very small women and very burly farmers
right?
have all 10s
I'm pretty sure commoners in dnd
although I can see what you're saying
humans don't roll d20s either
for character stat buy purposes
its not like humans often fall below 10 unless they choose to
one that doesn't increase their abilities whatsoever
well that's taking into account a natural human
maybe 12
the average human is probably 10-11
those are the animals down at 1
well eric, the strength measure in dnd takes into account seahorses
well 20 is the natural peak
and barbs are pretty good at that
well even girls need a frontline
well if its unappealing it probably isn't very good
gay
too much dark water
7.8/10
yikes
I agree
thanks eric
compared to a guy campaign
would you say that 2/10 is average for an all girls campaign
shadow gemi???
HAHAHHA
LMAO
oh
who was the white guy
oh
pretty good
the villain was white right?
I don't remember
eric did you see it
not that hard to comprehend
its basically widespread religion
mars we get it
if its a bad test
like the average of a test could be a 3/10
we he could be right in very specific, non-rating situations
I got that
yea
whether its dumb or not you can understand it
no eric I'm surprised you don't get it tho
I getcha
yea exactly mars
if you're comparing them to other modern movies you're right
compared to what tho
I do get what he's saying with the average being a 3/10 if you're comparing it to every movie ever made
that the average movie today is about a 3/10 or 4/10 compared to all movies ever released
ok mars so I agree
I think you start rating out of 7
uh
were you rating the music
wait mars what
damB
4/10?
i was thinking dark brown then i typed light brown not sure why
it doesn't always work
light brown is too idealistic
i think you're right
honestly
light brown and jet black
mars knows
seema
best hair color is light brown bro
jsjs
blondes = 3rd best
you're on mobile then
lmao
in 2018
no group call
???????????????????
how typical
with a bottle of hennessey
Which was why he got hit in the first place
No they fixed the bug that gave counterstrike startup
it was a bug
hashinshin was right afterall
Jax
Counter Strike no longer sometimes delays briefly before blocking attacks.
E - Counter Strike
RIGHT THROUGH THE COUNTERSTRIKE Fixed a bug where Counterstrike's buff could take up to 0.25 seconds to take effect.

I kinda like pumped up kicks
tyty
thx man
5 tits?
which I guess is cool in its own respect
it looked like dick-around simulator
I was watching forsen play it
it doesn't even look that good honestly
Lucian teemo etc
every champ with 500 range is bad in groups
is the 500 attack range
only bad part of her kit
yea she seems good
I agree

I haven't heard shit from brockhampton except one song that i didnt like
It just seemed a little pretentious for me
I haven't heard shit from brockhampton albiet one song that i didnt like
Yikes
Good morning!
b/c jett told me to turn it off
i mean i didn't listen to it all the way through
and by that
that song was interesting
yikes
its just decent
i think all of the stars has a decent intro, but its not anything INSANE
LMAO
i liked that one more than the rest
and it wasn't better the second time
we already heard it
bigshot was terrible
a little repetitive for my taste
its ok
oh i didn't even listen to this song enough to get to it
bongos are cool
it
ir is
the rest of it, listening to it again, is pretty decent
outro
the outra to i am isn't exactly good
or at least, it was interesting
the intro was good
fair
i didn't like the beat too much
I am was the other one i got close to liking
same
but still not anything superb
it gets better
actually
otherwise its not too bad
i just think the vocals in opps are boring
dude you didn't even see jammu
i thought it started out aight
asap
I recommend you mute brothers vro
btw
yea same
the snare drum background in some of them isn't good either
same
YEAA
yup
but the vocals are all pretty similar
Edited previous message: i feel like the intros to these songs are very different
i feel like the intros to these songs are very differnet
I just don't like the rap background beat
I am is almost good
then it goes back to the type of rap I don't like
Opps has an interesting intro
I like the piano in the background
if it just left out the classic modern rap background it'd be sick
I think I almost like the actual song Black Panther
the first 3 seem rather similar
I'm doing it
: (
I don't like this type of music
it does
the girl?
zacari
who is c]zacari
momentarily
I think rohit lost internet connection
maybe ill listen to the whole thing
hm
ty
or he'll think I betrayed his trust
say stuff to rohit rq
vros
I don't like it much tho
bro
I thought the same thing
ikr
i'll do it in a bit
ok
b/c he'll go back to school and he has no phone lol
it'd only last like 10 days
if I were to make a chat with rohit
ok so
yup
skype
no
damn this is hard
maybe
miles would spam too much
LOL
yea
i think rohit wouldn't like Michael that much
I feel like I can just throw Michael and miles in
anyone else?
it'd be on skype
you don't have to
but I mean if you don't want to
its funny to just read the rohit conversations
I guess
lets go
w/o receiving cancer messages
I think I just figured out how to stay on the "online" skype mode
and talk to him when you see a number next to the chat
you could just mute it
hahahaha
like maybe 3 times a day
semi-frequently
with anyone who wants to be a part of it
like i'll make a new one
would you guys be down to be in a group with rohit
probably inaccurate tbh
from different areas
many different types of black people
yes
lol miles
nada
Dan "she's a fighter" Schneider
officially roasted
rip diego
Mustve been all of us spreading the word of vro
I think jimmy started something
Vros...
clearly
.
probably his autistic sister
:'(
from dad?
by the recipient
especially when its referred to as "sprim"
it does
what a dad
^
he's working hard to support us all
yea don't say that about dad
Y I K E S
: ^)
no homo
same bro
.
should that remain a forbidden fruit?
but autistic gay love
LMAOOOO
it hits harder than a wrecking ball
theres no way to prepare someone for this news
LMAO
just thought you should know that autistic gays are doing better than us at finding love
and Daniel had to clean it up
and ethan sprayed his "sprim" all over daniel
turns out the two of them butt fucked
theyre both autistic
Michael do you remember ethan grant and or ian (Daniel) register from samo?
sprim
he's not safe either
you're right
we do
except david I don't think anyone finds him absurd
yea probably
probably surreal humor
gang
maybe even 5/10
in terms of strength
swain is maybe a 6/10 champ
or are you trolling
can you join us miles
KEEPo
new patch
anyone wanna hop on league
ey
rohit's final words
"Yah.....bro
I have to get success in cricket....and i want to come usa just for seen
How...it can done many depression
I hate my life"
anyone wanna play duck game?
or some other game perhaps?
league anyone
yo
I'm gonna take a shower first, but i'll team afterwards

: ^)
#notmyR
leave out the hard r
dude
10/10
a girl so messed up that she thinks I'm innocent and treats me differently, then holds onto me as a friend so she can cry on my shoulder after her third boyfriend this month leaves her
that's my kind of friend tbh
like a cello
same
did you take the quiz yet miles
yes
^
ye
me ready
ooh
: (
what is pyre?
so you're just riding the wave
its too hard to try to influence such a vast array of personality types
yea i agree
its hard for me in larger groups
same here
^
you're often rather harmonizing and calming
its probably easier for you though
its hard to maintain that
but it also felt natural for that time
i was doing really well that day so i was really happy about it
she said "you have a naturally calming air to you, you make me feel calm like i can trust you"
Edited previous message: i remember a French woman who spoke little English told me that exact thing about me mars
i remember a French woman who spoke little English told me that exact thing about me me mars
some people are naturally better at that
its more passive than what i made it out to be
yea
i guess you're right
yea, its just overall harder to be a healthy 9
b/c its hard to openly try to stabilize people
level 3 is already hard to achieve for type 9 imo
[12:47:52 PM] Eric Huang: Level 1 (At Their Best): Become self-possessed, feeling autonomous and fulfilled: have great equanimity and contentment because they are present to themselves. Paradoxically, at one with self, and thus able to form more profound relationships. Intensely alive, fully connected to self and others.

Level 2: Deeply receptive, accepting, unselfconscious, emotionally stable and serene. Trusting of self and others, at ease with self and life, innocent and simple. Patient, unpretentious, good-natured, genuinely nice people.

Level 3: Optimistic, reassuring, supportive: have a healing and calming influence‚Äîharmonizing groups, bringing people together: a good mediator, synthesizer, and communicator.

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
: ^)
b/c otherwise you'll be too hard to be around
maybe level 2 and 3 are easier to compensate for that
well i feel like its hard to be a level 1 type 1 for sure
its not easy though, it's still difficult
type 1
er
but that's the difficult part of being a level 1
realistically theyre simple, but you're the main setback on this advancement
but its hard to get over yourself enough to reach these virtues
Edited previous message: b/c you are good at harmonizing groups
but sometimes you don't push for harmony like this suggests
b/c you're are good at harmonizing groups
but its definitely not every day
mars you're like this more often than i am
[12:47:52 PM] Eric Huang: Level 3: Optimistic, reassuring, supportive: have a healing and calming influence‚Äîharmonizing groups, bringing people together: a good mediator, synthesizer, and communicator.

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
i think i can openly say I'm level 4
i honor you too often
LMAO
^
i didn't really notice it until today
mine will change sometimes in respect to yours
after i sent one
yea i see that you're messages come in slow
hahahha
LMAO
smh
typical 1
lul
(he was joking)
and when i'm truly mad at someone i go full 7
i think on a bad day i get down to 5 or rarely 6
YOINKS
like it takes a really good day for me to get to level 3
but tend to be around 4
on a good day I'm level 3
it was a joke eric
yea ik
yea i can get on board with that ;)
LOL
level 9
yikes
that's the case for me, at least
maybe we expect that you've done more self reflecting than you have, so its just hard for us to believe that you don't have an understanding of yourself
ok it can be wrong
we know what you're saying 100% we just think that isn't the case
but we're simplifying it to lying to yourself
David we know what you're saying
yea
it comes off as lying to yourself
to something that wont bite back
theres no fear in putting down the right answer
but its a test
?
i guess
people are just so used to lying that it can be hard to be honest to a test
Edited previous message: exactly lol
eactly lol
^
?
that's not that weird is it/
you get it now
dude I'm a cleric
yoinks
but 1 and 8 were both below 5
9, 7, 2, 1, 8
well it was 7 secondary
in the words of Nathan
erics basically a chinese
mars maybe that means you're more of a 9 than you thought
I forgot that was a requirement
duh
right
oh
so I'm not sure why I'm 9w1
but 2 was higher
I scored 1.4 points of difference between 1 and 2
Edited previous message: but it said 9w1
but it sais 9w1
I'd be 9w2 based on results
I think I was 9w1 as well
you definitely see both sides of every argument
I see you as type 9, at least partially mars
where did you find that list?
definitely
and just watch everyone else
after you've lived to the point where you can take yourself out of the equation
I feel like 2 and 1 are only achieved in old age
the perfect 1 is really perfect
damn
that confused me sorry
why would they use the same amount of levels as personality types?
you're right
OH
oh
etc
its not saying that 9's are always unhealthy and that 1s are always healthy
while 9 in a n unhealthy setting is like that
aka 1 in a healthy setting is like that
that's saying for each number, that's how they'll act in that setting
eric what
I had that issue on my old laptop
the double typing?
I don't think that's the case
uh
yea i'd agree that isn't you
its true
but you're a 1
or, you're ideally a 5
5 is second for you imo
nah I see 1 in you a lot
thought so
Kappa
you are falling into the trap of the 9
david no, the website says you'll mistake yourself for a 5 often
eric what list was that?
yikes
HILLARY CLINTON
:thinking:
which is a bit much off
with a score of 4.0
I got 1 as my 4th highest
from what i'm reading on the 9
well, 2's equal women normally
Well you're aren't entirely a 9
david you tryna beef or nah?
Nines, especially males, frequently mistype as Fives, but Fives are intellectually contentious whereas Nines are conciliatory and conflict avoidant.
yea exactly
you're imposing them upon others
yea, personal morals
maybe that's because 9's are a mix of 5, 7, 2, and 4?
7 and 2 were my next ones
they got me on point
LOL
as well as 2
but I could see how 7 is so close
for the most part
yea, that's almost the same for me but I do feel like I'm actually a 9
these are my 3 highest scores.
Type 9 - 8.7
Type 7 - 7.4
Type 2 - 5.4
also mars, that isn't my first orange ever but its the first one I've seen in months
but type 7 and 2 were close
I got type 9 digbo
Woohoo
Danech's color is cancer
regure

swain is cool and rengar is fun
w/ me
get on pbe
No
Pbe only
He was a nonfactor in my game because i camped him lol
New swain did you play him?
Yes of course. That's exactly what I mean. You see, the reason why TryndamereSquare Tryndamere can do the shit he does is because he is capable of dealing large damage innately. Even moreso when he is at his lowest point, 1 health with Undying Rage Undying Rage active. To make his towerdives work, one needs to understand just how powerful he is to be able to do a towerdive.

The reason TryndamereSquare Tryndamere must have confidence in his strength is because his innate strength is wonky, but the only thing he can do about that wonky innate strength is build to improve it. It's not healthy by any means, because a player shouldn't ever feel like they can't control their own situation--without any enemies slapping you with CC. However, that's the reality of TryndamereSquare Tryndamere right now.

If there is even the slightest doubt that he cannot kill his enemy in his 1 health crisis, he must bail because his vulnerability is massive when he's stuck at such low health. If there is even the slightest doubt and he flees to late, he's just going to die.

TryndamereSquare Tryndamere is stupidly simple. Yet, as simple as he is, he is capable of dealing a lot of pain with just a couple autoattacks. What I'm suggesting is that making his kit more complex can remove the reliance on such awkward RNG reliance. I'm also saying it's not as easy as it seems to change his kit because many other champions also fit his current personality. His unique aspect could easily falter.

In my opinion, I don't think it's possible to remove the Critical strike icon critical strike portion of his kit that Hypnotic Orange suggested, but it is possible to make his Critical strike icon critical strike more meaningful.

One idea I have is to allow TryndamereSquare Tryndamere to "overcrit" when he uses his Undying Rage Undying Rage. Essentially, the concept being the he gains a raw amount of Critical strike icon crit chance from his ultimate. Anything that exceeds 100% will become the new overcrit chance. This overcrit could deal a bleed to enemies and dealing an overcrit would slightly extend the duration of Undying Rage Undying Rage--allowing him to stay alive longer.

This is no solution to his problem, just a way to make Critical strike icon critical strike on TryndamereSquare Tryndamere more unique. A solution to his problem would mainly need changes to his innate and basic skills since those are what affect his laning phase. Something like adding a temporary lifesteal boost when he activates Bloodlust Bloodlust.

However, given that TryndamereSquare Tryndamere performs pretty well now, the most important thing to think of is what should appropriate pitfalls for TryndamereSquare Tryndamere be. For that, I believe him being out of combat should be his biggest pitfall.

An extreme example would be that Undying Rage Undying Rage will not make him invulnerable if he is not in combat. So if he's picked off by a KarthusSquare Karthus' Requiem Requiem, he will die even with Undying Rage Undying Rage. Though, I think that would be quite unfair if someone casts it by accident, the condition could be that he cannot cast Undying Rage Undying Rage unless he is in combat. He could circumvent this weakness by charging into a jungle camp.

Again, I don't think this is a complete rework for TryndamereSquare Tryndamere. There are still many things to deal with like managing how powerful Critical strike icon critical strike, deciding whether or not TryndamereSquare Tryndamere's new kit should synergize with a form of tankiness, and having a solid reason for why he should stay in combat. These are merely ideas that align with his current feel.

If you are still confused of what I mean by faith. It's not the faith of the Critical strike icon critical strike itself. It is the faith in TryndamereSquare Tryndamere's damage output to pull off successful trades and towerdives, because that's what matters in the end.

The absolute confidence in the damage you will deal as TryndamereSquare Tryndamere is what is required, which stretches beyond mere make-believe fairy tale dreams. I'm talking about the raw understanding of the sheer damage capabilities one can expect from TryndamereSquare Tryndamere.

Which is, "believing / knowing something is happening / will happen even if you can't completely prove it right just now," because you have studied it in reality or through statistical calculations, most likely involving confidence intervals. Though let's be real, no average person is going to be using statistics to figure out the damage, but everyone knows that TryndamereSquare Tryndamere will deal some supa crits early on just by playing him.
never forget
Tryndamere is designed to be played purely by faith. The level of confidence the player has when playing. Tryndamere directly affects how he will perform. With that understanding, it's not strange at all.

What depicts faith more than probability in gameplay? Nothing. As there is already probabilities of how one will perform with consistency, adding in probabilities in the usage makes it more convoluted. Thus his Critical strike icon critical strike passive is interactive enough to tell the player he must maintain the highest fury to have the greatest chances when dueling, while having them hanging onto hope to perservere.

If it were only his Battle Fury that depicted this playstyle, then I would agree. However, this devotion literally permeates his entire kit. Bloodlust is his hesitance button. If Tryndamere is hesitating to use his aggression, then he activates Bloodlust and he gets relief through a heal. His confidence then matches his level of fury, which is none.

On the flip side Bloodlust also serves as a reward for his own confidence. It's not easy to fight at low levels of health. So, increasing his AD by how little health he has compensates for the fear of death. When forced to fight to survive, he must fight. That is the realization this presents.

Mocking Shout is an ability that punishes the enemies' lack of confidence and temporarily sets duelists at a level beneath him. While it doesn't seem like much, it serves as an enabler for him to fight the enemy. It's enough to say that he will be able to consistently attack the enemy in this duration, and that frequency is affected by his Battle Fury through Critical strike icon critical strike.

While Spinning Slash may enable passive gameplay, it rewards aggressive gameplay through the cooldown reducing mechanic and the fury gains in cleaving through many enemies--the only other means of increasing his fury. This forces Tryndamere to be aggressive to make the most of the ability.

Then finally, there is the ultimate confidence booster: Undying Rage. Notice how I call it a confidence "booster," as making the most of its usage is in a situation similar to Bloodlust. If he is forced to fight for his life, even with no fury, he will fight. He will gain a large amount of fury which will in turn translate into how useful this turnabo
but based on splash art i think tyrant got the short end of the stick
we'll have to see how they all look in game as well
eyy
who can hop on league with parsa and i
vros
northern front looks like a badass
yea
too much shadow
well its just a little lacking in detail really
yea id say
i like default the best i think
really is
xd
i'll have to wait for a pbe gameplay video from redmercy i guess
yea that's true
that'll be funny
oh shit ignite now procs minion aggro
his w i approve
and his kit looks fun to play noww
He's actually cool now
Yea
Kappa

he's an edgy general
i really like swain lmao

i saw that shit too
oh yes
HIS BROKEN LEG
i saw someone say in the comments "They took everything cool about swain away, like his broken leg and his transformation ult"
i don't see where else he can use the soul fragments
I wonder if swain can only consume his passive through his ultimate
hahaha
exactly
and a warlock
yea he's a sith lord mixed with luscious malfoy
nice
definitely going to play him
I really like new swain's design though
his q looked like a graves auto worth of damage tbh
His w damage looked high
dead
like ally cc &gt; passive &gt; e &gt; w &gt; passive &gt; w strikes &gt; q
A good swain will be able to combo that so well
I think his passive is nuts
new swain btw
i'd play him

yes
looks like a new champ almost
she actually doesn't look like lux though
just kinda boring
but she looks a little more human in that picture
they just made her look half chinese
its not a facial improvement at all
i like the arctic ops gragas skin
lux is kinda boring compared to elementalist
the warwick splash is nice and the skin is just ok
i love the nasus skin and splash
i think
I like the xayah skin
that nasus one tho
what do you guys think of the splash arts
same
are we playing league
miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiichael

and ill just climb from there
or 2
ill probably end up gold 1
if I go 5-5
that's how hard my bot lane and jungle inted
I lost a game today where I was 10-0 on galio bro
I'm sure it is
is so painful
playing in gold

pretty sure my account is still gold 1
based on these past 5 games ive played
yee

yea if you're stuck in silver I doubt that will be the cae
if you're climbing
yea I mean
I felt way better after my flex climb
playing ranked actually does get you better
I mean you'll improve really quickly too
diamond solo*
starting early this time
I'm gonna try for diamond
I can imagine why
oh
or is the website just down
is my guess
b/c you have no ranked games played this season
is my guess
probably silver 2
it'll be a climb regardless
I have gold 1 mmr solo anyways
as they really don't matter that much
I might just do my placements
unlucky

I don't see how that would be enlightening for his adversary, except he would learn a bit about cave people
while I'm not sure if it works the same way with taking the man out of the cave
because pain comes from removing the mask but he would actually inflict pain on his adversary
but I get it now
it makes more sense when bane says it
ehhhhh
but I like platos cave
I guess I just don't know the line

THOSE are what count
that's not where the normal games are
but smurfs don't really count tbh
low plat games
they were plat games
you were playing ranked almost entirely
idk if that's true
nice
on ccool?
wonder why Kappa
my azir stats when smurfing are insane
which is solid
at 7.3
the highest cs/min was on azir
and fighing silvers
but we're also smurfing
even better
we're like challenger players
damn eric together on crs moiboy
yea
pkk maybe
LOL
yea
fiora = 10
9+7 = 16

yea but I'm the taric

you're pretty good at knowing where that one guy is
yea i was about to say
you have solid gpm
you do
i think my warding has to do with my low avg deaths
LOL
lmao
clearly not in your case
i mean
on mid
10.6 wards per game
but i do ward a lot even on mid
from playing support
my wards per game are super inflated
you have solid wards
avg deaths
i have 5
cmon
mars
ok 7.6 avg deaths
gotta pad my kda
I'm playing for the stats baby
no need to feed
amirite
why die
stop feeding
you had .4 more average deaths than me eric
how much damage you did before you inted
LMAo
wtf
so broken
that's actually
I'm a beast
my lulu kda is 4.9
would do well with you
his playstyle
i see it
mine was 44:52
you just made that up lmao
lol
it doesnt
you're right
oh wait
where does it say that
azir does tho
asol and kass don't farm well
i played asol azir and kass
all of them
just farm it out characters
those are like
you played lux vlad and ori mid
uh huh
and he just roams and doesn't cs
were on asol
also most of my games this year for mid
and get some fucking wards down
maybe you gotta stop farming
and .2 lower kda
ul
but you have 3.5 less wards per game
if you look at both of our mid lane stats you have an average of 17 more gpm than me
i have 42% of my games on support
eric
2.5
and that's all that matters right
than his
your kda is better
 its ok
o.o
cmonBruh
you have a lower average cspm than dualtwin
damn eric
I GOTTA LOOK IT
DUALTWIN
whats there to be ashamed of
i mean
tsk tsk
1.7kda
I'm looking at yours right now
yes
he blows
I'm looking at imaqtpie compared to me
LMAO
and change the summoner name at the end
you can just edit the link
i looked at yours
for you
and its lux
i got at least 2 of my pentas on azir
:thinking:
i wonder who's inflating that number
not this year I guess
same
unlucky
as I was on moises' account
I don't have that baron on my main though
mhm
where I was azir on moises' account
it was from that flex game
I'm glad I'm doing my job right
you have more cs than a support main
yes
.
and jg
yes
maybe its because you jungle so much
at 42% played with 0.9cs per minute on support
with support being my dominant role played
I average 3.5 cs per minute
idk lol
of course
These stats are slightly skewed, as higher elo games are often shorter
time to ward more
I outperform the average challenger support in every way except wards
heres mine
league did a year in review thing
this is sick

I'm sure you can figure it out
but you could just spam those
i think only background blocks can
yikes
so I assume a certain type of background block is allowed to carry an externa jpeg as a texture
I know eric used that "thousand needles" world of Warcraft picture as a background
yea
Edited previous message: did you know you can import media files onto duck game
theoretically, you could put dual's face as the background
did you know you can import media files onto duck you

TryndamereSquare Tryndamere is designed to be played purely by faith. The level of confidence the player has when playing TryndamereSquare Tryndamere directly affects how he will perform. With that understanding, it's not strange at all.

What depicts faith more than probability in gameplay? Nothing. As there is already probabilities of how one will perform with consistency, adding in probabilities in the usage makes it more convoluted. Thus his Critical strike icon critical strike passive is interactive enough to tell the player he must maintain the highest fury to have the greatest chances when dueling, while having them hanging onto hope to perservere.

If it were only his Battle Fury Battle Fury that depicted this playstyle, then I would agree. However, this devotion literally permeates his entire kit. Bloodlust Bloodlust is his hesitance button. If TryndamereSquare Tryndamere is hesitating to use his aggression, then he activates Bloodlust Bloodlust and he gets relief through a heal. His confidence then matches his level of fury, which is none.

On the flip side Bloodlust Bloodlust also serves as a reward for his own confidence. It's not easy to fight at low levels of health. So, increasing his AD by how little health he has compensates for the fear of death. When forced to fight to survive, he must fight. That is the realization this presents.

Mocking Shout Mocking Shout is an ability that punishes the enemies' lack of confidence and temporarily sets duelists at a level beneath him. While it doesn't seem like much, it serves as an enabler for him to fight the enemy. It's enough to say that he will be able to consistently attack the enemy in this duration, and that frequency is affected by his Battle Fury Battle Fury through Critical strike icon critical strike.

While Spinning Slash Spinning Slash may enable passive gameplay, it rewards aggressive gameplay through the cooldown reducing mechanic and the fury gains in cleaving through many enemies--the only other means of increasing his fury. This forces TryndamereSquare Tryndamere to be aggressive to make the most of the ability.

Then finally, there is the ultimate confidence booster: Undying Rage Undying Rage. Notice how I call it a confidence "booster," as making the most of its usage is in a situation similar to Bloodlust Bloodlust. If he is forced to fight for his life, even with no fury, he will fight. He will gain a large amount of fury which will in turn translate into how useful this turnabout is. Since there are only increases in fury, it will not reward the standard aggressive playstyle, it will only reward turnabouts from increasing ranks.

His whole entire kit isn't really interactive. However, his whole entire kit revolves around his faith. Laning as TryndamereSquare Tryndamere requires complete confidence. It's not all that strange that he is completely based on an emotion. After all, 3 of his icons are literally just him roaring. That said, any changes to TryndamereSquare Tryndamere would require a replication of this dedication to faith. That is surprisingly difficult since his entire kit revolves around his confidence.

It's easy to overlook this when he is jungling, since he will always be ganking confidently. However, this faith is made absolutely clear when he is laning. He desires complete confidence and will punish a lack of it. It's why he is the ultimate counter to IllaoiSquare Illaoi, both in lore and in lane.

What this also means is that he is weak against a siege formation which is the Tank icon Warden, Marksman icon Marksman, and Mage icon Artillery combination. It's difficult to get anywhere near them, so if they are constantly hounding him down then he will have no choice to fight. However, their CC and range means he is able to do very little if he is caught. The reason why he always flees from teams is that if he were ever caught by the team with solid CC and ranged power, he would get royally screwed over.

Since he is screwed over by even a standard team composition, it makes little sense for him to be so invested in faith if he has no faith in his ability to teamfight. It's not laning phase which makes his kit confusing, but mid-game and onwards.

Rito does not like noninteractive kits, they are in the process of reworking them. So if you can think of a way to revolve his kit around faith in a manner that allows him to teamfight confidently, then it is an entirely plausible change. If anything though, changes like that can put him in positions way too similar to other champions since Fighter icon Diver is essentially this and there are way too many divers in the game already.
some dude wrote a fucking article-length description about why playing tryndamere is all about faith
like i thought itd be
that's not a link to the servers
deigo
i thought i was undergoing the Michael glitch
I was wondering why I couldn't log in
is that what it is?
oh
imaqtpie is a genius apparently
xddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
hey look this article says I'm not retarded xd
good thing you were studying league
haHAA
lmk when you're available
wanna play?
saves you 350 gold on boots
Cant be that bad
maybe that's the case on top of everything else
so that could be the cause of that ratio being so high
overall, galio loses most of the games he's picked
and galio does have the lowest winrate in the game
xerath isn't picked much so it could be off
damn that winrate
so do gp players
ekko players build it sometimes
but you can try it lol
I wouldn't want it at all
but once you fully upgrade it the cs penalty goes away
since you're csing
its just terrible to buy it normally b/c you have a hard time proccing it
and the quest reward is crazy good for him
it does damage and it can be really good in easy matchups
Feels Good
You got me
the art makes me love it so much
nightblue and qt
but he inted
b/c he got camped to be fair
and he inted
this is the game that I played against the rank 1 NA player wiggily in ranked flex
you can have it
I love it
ikr
that's dual
idc if he's white
that's dual for the time being
you could at LEAST get gold
mars if you didn't dc every minute

weeabot is unstoppable
weeabot is popping off
anyone wanna slowly lose interest in the new league of legends update with me?
ey
yes
remember the good times
get in here
mars
and that's not that hard
velkoz e is harder to hit
so its not totally braindead
although it does hit minions
its pretty wide
no its not that easy to dodge
but you can just land an e and one shot someone
insanely hard
shed be like
if she had a different e
so you cant miss q
because the e stops them for two seconds
you don't even have to use the ult
honestly my issue with her is that her e is so braindead
the ult will evolve tho
and her ult is just for extending q and juking
her numbers are gross
but rn on pbe
faker is gonna be the only one using the ult right tho
SUPEr fast
its really simple
watch a video
its not
no
its really just her ult
and everyone knows how to use summoners
her passive is auto attacking
and the e is braindead
the q is really easy tho
the ult will take some getting used to
and hes a yasuo player lol
yassuo was playing her rather proficiently
zoe isn't even that hard from the video I saw
they just aim their abilities
no other mage even worries about movement
I mean
for sure
asol has probably the highest skill cap of any mage
asol
on azol
and you die
he presses q w r
hes really a mage
I mean
well he still has a high skill cap
rip azir
actually
is the only one
asol
.
Edited previous message: honestly zoe's w is good but its not incredibly broken
its just super broken at times
honestly zoe's w is good but its not incredible broken
fuck zoe e
her e is broken tho
when I'm tired
same
just gonna ignore what you said
shes a nerd champ tbh
she is rather hard to play compared to sona and soraka
well, maybe not
I'm pretty sure egirls are going to spam her as a support
its fucking stupid
then another one is probably on the ground so you can use that
you use it then you get movespeed and some fox-fire bullshit
it lasts about 40 seconds
you pick it up from the ground
it is
yea
that needs to be removed or standardized
why do summoner spells drop off minions
yup

I'm the cutoff line

Thats some good lore right there miles
Boom

asol is riots OC
FeelsBadMan
I miss when azir was the hardest champ
same
almost
Keepo
just curious
where are you seeing the hard numbers?
e is pretty powerful so I'm not surprised
I meant q
or smth
like it starts at 20 then goes to 8
then goes lower with rank significantly
I hope the cd is kinda high in lane
for max q distance
ghost flash on her fosho
yea
makes sense
or probably Diana r
when I saw it I thought it HAD to be like riftwalk
whats her ult cd
it just looks like hes a pedo
Normally i'd say yes, but he's grown it out to a point where it doesn't look sloppy

:THINKING:
with the tatoo
is that Nathan?
yea its sick actually
I just saw this shit live
holy
So is it knowledge of the raid that is most important?
idk
is movement huge or just forced upon you at certain times?
what are the mechanics really like?
I don't know that much about eso really, so I'm just assuming a bit too much
and jett gave me a ton of lectures about wow
That's how it is in wow too
it can just be overshadowed for certain difficulty requirements by item levels
there obviously is
I didn't mean it that bluntly actually
ah
its just not skill-based progression
not a bad thing
they suck you into a vortex in which grinding is necessary for progression
MMOs are really grindy yea
unranked*
after being like plat 2
my boy terry is gold 3
yea it definitely can be
which might not be for everyone
it just takes longer and has less instant gratification
progress in league is notable through skill improvement though
then dont
unless you don't like it
but its not like you cant play league at all
i know you do
is something i do sparingly
climbing
you should follow my lead(gue)
i do about equal

even a bow and arrow is unfair for hunting jews
its like taking a a sniper rifle to hunt some deer
theres no sport in it
I don't think i'd ever hunt jews
You know
pbe is a mess
:thinking:
but pbe is more fun
I think he means league
unlucky
but you gotta end it after those months are over
its 6 months free
get prime for free
So
and you can sub to lily/poki
its free with a college email
get prime...vro...

ad block?
oh
Kappa
Prime running out?
wtf
lz got 3-0d by samsung
true that tho
when i made a general statement
you started this by saying that i was roasting you
why
im with it
i don't fuck with shit
do spirits shit?
maybe
for her tho?
never
hungry for dat ass
I know you aren't thirsty lol

but all I see is the south failing once again
he smelled something burning and he's here to defend himself
I aint taking shots at no rednecks
KAPPA NO KAPPA
just word it better and you have legislation lining up to help your ass
and that's why theres never any action taken upon it
most arguments made by women to appeal to a mass populous just suck
yea
tits are illegal b?
like why cant she not wear a top
and all the ideals
yup
its deeprooted in American culture
its all that Christian suppressing women bullshit that keeps them insecure
that leads to craziness
theyre raised to be hyper self conscious at all times
they aren't innately crazy
girls are raised to be crazy
im jk
nah that's just me making shit up
Kappa
not saying one thing leads to another but if girls were a lil thirstier maybe some kids would've been saved yknow
I don't have any evidence but I feel like its a safe guess
im pretty sure that most school shooters never had real girlfriends
rip local coop
those guys are products of failed parenting
those guys aren't raised to be like guys
no they wouldn't wtf
less "coi hard to get bs" and more "being real and talking n shit"
but crime rates would fall
well the world wouldn't chill
and the world would be chill
crimes against women would fall
im deadass sure that if girls were raised to be more like guys
nvm go on
she a thot?
forreal
if I have a daughter i'm raising her to be like me
is dumb as fuck
which to me
no its not confidence its "empowerment"
and deserve to chill
they deserve to be brought up with confidence
forreal tho why are girls raised differently
the end of an era
and we'd never get another bitch like hillary
and these thirsty ass gamers going for egirls
it would stop all these thots
im being deadass
so we can chill n shit
we should start raising girls like guys
she breathes don't she?
r I p
we'd have been raised differently and not act like how we do at all
if any of us were women
im a sweatpants kinda guy
I'm p sure
i'd be a stealth thot
hell yea they did
I'm with it this time
not against it or for it but its weird that its inconsistent
they made her tits way smaller
new kat splash art
since ads wont shred them as fast
I just hope league of tanks wont become a thing with the ardent nerfs
it'll be okay late game
its gonne suck as a rush
look at how low the base numbers are
we've moved to a new era boys
ardent censer is done for
Unique Passive 
attack speed lowered from [20% - 35%] to [10% - 30%]
additional damage lowered from [20 - 35] to [5 - 20]
also
he's still broken lol
only his ult changes
guys they didn't fully revert galio
Yea he got hacked lol
understandable
my mom brought two feminists over and theyre talking about women being objectified
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
:puke:
Ok.
Im her
She says B
.
Eric which one am i in that picture 
I feel like thats a fair argument
shits cancer
plants were ok but fuck blast cone
so bad
idk why you want that
Michael why do you want us all to have to die to tower and not be able to last hit minions w/ adcs
I dont
that's a baseline game mechanic
wait Michael you cant change your playstle around base stats
lol
and we couldn't last hit with adcs
yea
but that would suck b/c we'd all die to turrets minions and jg monsters
while mages didn't get any base ap
also they gave everyone armor b/c ad champs got base ad
while the old runes go to base stats
the new runes are essentially masteries
instead of base stat runes
so we can have fun runes
tho
base health = counter to ap
most people take mr blues tho
I'm not sure
they take health per level seals
mages don't take armor tho
in pro play
and bruam gets 20 b/c he takes armor quints
since we're losing armor seals
Michael they buffed everyones base armor by 10
GAY
It is inherently game
that's pretty gay
what a good name
penis retard 69
he dodged :(
come online...
vro...we done here...vroo
good game with you... hahah
Michael and good

Lesgoo
wanna pray?
pbe is back up

wanna play pbe
yo ethugs
today
I've seen that one
great
yea
they were so upset
i don't really mind that he did it, but my whole team except my thresh sounded like fucking 12 yr olds
it was fun, but it was definitely unwinnable
great game
and he was abusing this bug with predator that made his ult one shot people
btw guys i played a game on pbe today vs a nunu
i know this is groundbreaking news
that's about all I've gathered
the animation is voiced by some woman
according to the comments section
in place of those "led by adult women" sing along shows
so its like a cartoon
but that seems to be their whole market
i doubt it is
i just need to know if its an AI or not
this is weeaboo heaven tho
yea I've gathered that
and try to explain it to me
watch a video
I'm so lost
apparently its an ai that puts out youtube videos?
I'm so confused
can somebody explain to me wtf this is
and not very effective
it'd just be SUPER gay
yea
etc
or you could be trying to meme me
like you could be trying to burn me
i can interpret the way that you said "it is a critical hit" in so many ways
hehe xd

 yea
no.
REEEEEEEEE
cant spook the touc
that's probably true tbh
This is so shitty
Half of my class has left because of how boring thos documentary we're watching is
If cuphead was easy itd have tumblr all over it
Theyre just contra
I wouldnt buy it, torrent maybe lol
I played the genie one for like half an hour and couldnt beat it
The boss battle are pretty cool 
Stop 
The gameplay is contra lol
Art and music*
On facebook people are roasting the fanbase already 
Its slowly evolving 
Youll see
This copy pasta, i mean
This is fine
The fanbase for cuckhead is turning into undertale v2
Cuckhead
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cuphead. The gameplay is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the mechanics will go over a typical player‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Cuphead's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jumps, to realise that they‚Äôre not just hard- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Cuphead ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Cuphead's existential catchphrase ‚ÄúWhat's the matter? Bad at video games?,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Chad Moldenhauer‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ??

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Cuphead tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ??
I dont like the animation tho
The show is ok, its like a modern family guy
Yea the fans are cancer
Its not bad per se, but thats about it
Its the exact opppsite of complex
Im with it 
.
Im not sure that i appreciate that but it happened 
Theres always one fuck thats 1/2/0 but thinks he can carry
15 is too hard to accomplish 
&gt;interracial

Deadass no one said happy bday to my boy. Happy bday mars hope its great
theyre insecure deep down I'm sure of it
those are only sorta similar
also I'm not sure if weak self control = lack of character
but some of them just have thyroid issues
normally fat people are insecure
i can read it mars
i can get it now
H
O
oh
and it still doesn't
it didn't make any sense at all
I honestly couldn't read what you said
someone can be fat and a good person at the same time eric
shes just fat so it makes her look older
nothing against her or anything
yea
and has sunglasses
its because shes fat
deadass
she looks like shes 25
wtf does that even mean
mars

Hes right but gay for being right 
Yea thats what im saying 
Flying H I G H A B O V E T H E C L O U D S
S a m e
But id still call you gay
Still i agree
Rip diego
Yea i agree to a certain extent
Were they diamond as well?
Nice
No im out im sorry :(
:O
I can cut my hair
Or maybe
NO
I understand his argument
Buti get michaels thought process
I said they are gay tho
Makes sense
I get what youre saying
Lets go
Oh
But theyre still gay bro 
I actually get it
Wait i see whay youre saying
Do you believe they are gay?
Michael are traps gay?
YUP
Thank you trap god
I now understand this better
Gay hair 
Naturally feminine stance and head posture
The big lips
The slender face
Yea i see it
I see
And i feel like that might be the most importantant piece of makeup
Wait he looks like he has a lot of mascara
Right?
Hm it could be tho
Is the deciding factor
So the makeup
OHHG
This is true
High pitched voice
I have long hair, a thin body
So am i a trap?
I want this to be something more
Hm
Traps are illogical
Dude all im saying is
And now youre pandering to women
What if youre a reverse trap after surgery
You could be a trap tho
Surgery is the next step
If you go far enough to be a trap
All im saying is
Kappa
Dont assume their gender 
And identify as a male
But what if they want to be a guy 
Shemales dont exist tho
Maybe?
But still have a dick so they can calssify themselves as traps to fit a particular market
Dude what if they got surgery done to be a better trap
KappaPride
Rip him
But im sure its common
Ive never been successfully trapped
Do they not? They at least try 
They always find a way
You never know with traps
I dont wanna be gay
Its hard to trust a pair a tits knowing it could be a traps
Or his i dont trust traps 
I respect her ideology 
Seems good man
Savage
My bones are made of glass, and my skin is made of paper

True

That was just a really bad shot of the crowd
Wait the people here are all really rich Eric is right 
Beverley hills hotel

that shadow eve skin draws so much inspiration from jinx/kayn its almost unsettling
i don't like much about dota 2 but i like the name tango for that leaf
I like tango

the next game I played ivern support
crazy game
she was so tilted
bro I shat on their vi
yea lol
first time ivern btw
typical
then I played him again and I went 1-14
my ivern was godlike
bro
Im doing better now
GAAAAYYY
HA
oh cool
in what way
ok
that game was pretty gay too
traps are gay
actually yea
I love rpgs pixel art and shit like that
yea
but its passable
not sure I love it
yea
that too
id rather play chronotrigger again
after 94 minutes
I'm not even sure I like the game
s a m e
have a nice tilt
understandable

i didn't like it
i got tired of pepeunchained
my name is very not dank
your name is good

SLEEP
TO
GO
still has it
my pbe account
otherwise count me out
I'm down
if the "go to sleep 2015" icon is in the pool
ik
vs two good players
i had a dogshit team
ik
yea
tbh they should just make the numbers match
its just not great
yeah that's not TOO bad
right?
through that system
you can unlock them for less
the thing is tho since you get champ shards
yea...
so like
but i waited in q for legit 20 minutes
i want to play azir again
maybe
b/c I can already aim it
the fact that q is thicker isn't that noticeable
mhm
I relied on that shit a lot
tbh
its gonna be hard to get used to
me too
since it pushes you out
so you can flash further over it
its just normal terrain
but like
b/c I thought the ashe wouldn't be able to flash it
the ult change got me once
but yea
stfu idiot
but not damage that pushes the wave
vs champs
because it allowed for him to be buffed in damage
also the early game nerf to his w's multi target damage was really smart
but its worse
yea you can time his eq better
you need that shit to be perfect now
when going over walls
yea its a bit more lenient
since his range is lower
but it did help with the shurima slide
and it was noticeable
he moves slower during e
yea
and increased the base range on his w
they slowed down his e
yea
for reference
which is kassadin qs duration
yea but it only lasts 1.5 seconds
it just actually shows up now
but its not THAT much better
yea its better
his range was cancer anyways
good changes overall
yea
and I was getting one shot by ashe mid game
my tank tf fed his ass off
but
they thought hard about these changes
its still passable
mhm
is really not good
like his range
even tho his range is bad
certainly better than current azir
I did feel like azir was pretty good
but
and a 51 cs yorick
a 0-11 ornn
with a bronze tank tf support
I played one single game of azir bot
so
i did that today
you can recover it michael
yea
LOL
and jett just got the response
i sent a support ticket earlier today
i do now
no
okie
lul
wanna play on pbe
to learn her
itd be a good investment
shes good tho
that didn't get deactivated
people with old pbe accounts
maybe you could email them
for months now
but its been down
but I'm not sure
well the website is down
or smthn
on april 4th
it got cancelled
i tried today
yes
and I always just used jetts
you cant sign up for them anymore
not sure
it got deactivated
yea
I tried
doesn't work anymore
his
hes on pbe
but this also means that he strong
is that good or bad
theyre already nerfing azirs rework
ye
these aren't there yet tho
not facebook yet
and other league of legends owned chat services
its for the riot forums
how riots emotes are being used to make low quality memes
I just think its funny
lmao
ahri can now meme
league made meme emotes
but has he stepped up?
he was already in action

btw guys happy 9/11
and riot lul
itd be cool but that would be giving two champs away for free
i doubt it
and no
we don't know yet
lmfao
ofc he is
LuL
yea
and good
he was pretty entertaining
i actually do
i miss the old nightblue
yea
but probably not
i don't have the answer lol
I mean
LuL
it was picked in the lpl September 3rd
nightblue is just a fraud
oh
and now fakers playing it
1 million views
dude
its doable
I said 10 seconds
it was him
I'm pretty sure
like watch the first 10 seconds
which is what everyones doing rn
I'm like 70% sure that nightblue started ezreal jg with stormraiders
the funny thing is
just more mobility
similar burst especially with ult
he could build like corki if he didn't have mana issues
Edited previous message: and could build tri w/o tear and be okay
lol
yea
and could build try w/o tear and be okay
say he didn't have mana issues
nonono
yea he would
but no they spike and he has shit pieces of items
and hed win
the same time they complete an item
if he didn't build tear he could get triforce in a slightly advantageous lane vs the enemy ad
yea because he has the fucking tear in the way
like deceptively good
hes actually pretty good in lane
when the enemy ad is on ie and ardent buffs
because hes on a tear and pieces of tri
he just gets outspiked
you don't start the lane with ardent censor
well you cant really say "ardent ads" and "in lane"
so you're pretty strong late game
ie phantom dancer
you end up building like
yea
miniscule
ty autocorrect
not the word I wanted
wtf
they were pretty meniscal
I guess?
um
hes just good
faker isn't even a jungler
faker is 5-1 rn
where its missing
he can really add a lot of dmg
no its really good on specific team comps
ikr??
I wanna try it but I suck ass at jg
is p good
skirmishers saber
for dueling
but that actually builds into something useful
you buy a jg item
so instead of buying tear
so he doesn't even have to build tear
the jg item has really good mana regen
just normal ezreal
not really
consistently
which helps him clear
he has attack speed on his passive
its good
but like
its not exclusively jg gameplay
no ezreal has more games played than any jungler in the game right now
kinda like how graves is
its just good
live
rn
even faker is playing it
ye
is meta now
I still cant believe ezreal jg
smh
he aint worth the house
LMAO
.
like how does that come to pass
ok
but plays with a god
he sucks ass
an endangered species
at times
i only meant that the title made it difficult to talk about the movie
it was good tho
it
its hard to talk about
fuck the title tho
not IT was weird
"it" as in snow was IT
scary at times
well written especially for a horror movie
ye
it was weird
dude i kept thinking snow was IT
yea
I'm a little blasted
so rn
and he had vodka
deadass tho i was at Matthews house last night
no worries lmao
hahahha
smc bby
samo is santa monica high school
never ask if I'm at samo
never say that to me again
stfu idiot
now i must go to class
well ive said what i think about dota
just not mechanically fun
if you can play it
i mean dota looks fun
he should be doing that
liek
so split pushing is what you're trying to bring up?
and powerspikes
so it really is about playing around items
legit every time
then autod to death
get stunned
I'm just watching everyone in qts game
juggernaut is not one of those characters
really cool
by design
there are some cool characters in dota tho
idk what you expected
he doesn't understand social interactions or emotions well
hes autstic
dude
not whose
who's
whose regi
remy
like actually
remy is autistic
remy
because of what we know about it
we don't want to
parsa
dota is about knowing what to buy, how to use it, and when to use it
i just don't like it as much
I'm fine with that as a basis
so its really understanding the game rather than mechanically outplaying your opponent
you just have to know when and how to do it
you just press a button
that's a dota mechanic but its not hard
and playing around low mechanic gameplay is really hard
but understanding the game is very high skill
is minimal
no mechanical skill in dota
but i don't want to
that i could get around
theres just a lot of no skill shit in dota
but with 5 champions on the map
it legit feels like Warcraft 3
i feel like dota doesn't even feel like a moba
rather than cs
and actually play
is they want you to play around many of the games flaws
i think the thing about dota
it would be better
and put it in dota instead of their cryptic stuff
if they took the good stuff from league
what I'm saying is
yea i really didn't like that
rather than an interesting mechanic
but having to upgrade certain items only at secret shops feels like a chore
that could work too
yup
its very slow
its not
yea
but i don't like it in a moba
i get what they were going for
i really don't like secret shops though
gay
its like
its beyond nerdy
its just not cool
why the fuck
yea
are aids
secret shops
but its lame
I'm sure once you play it enough you get used to it
that's pretty lame conceptually
with a % chance
missing on high ground
also
that's pretty shitty tho
i don't think that's that bad
he has a normal name but goes by invoker
i don't think we need to be that petty
wtf
but i don't even want to do that
to get used to it
I'm sure it would just take like 20 games
the autos are the real cancer for me
if it lasts longer than 35 minutes its already dragging on
i agree actually
that's true
unless you have stuns?
then you have to do nothing but farm until you're relevant again
but when its you it sucks ass
tbh tho the most fun part of dota seems to be that you can completely fuck over a few guys in the early game
wasn't that*
i think they fixed it a bit
nah eric when I played the turning was that unbearable
my messages sent
HOLY
dota is just shit
that's a pretty good thing about dota
i do wish that league was less punishing for roaming early
mechanically
its just that the combat is very simple most of the time
i guess that's not too bad
constantly
you just don't lane and you gank people
so to avoid that
yea
woah there they all are
i cant even type none of my messages are sending wtf
theres also a lot of targeted harass
not innate abilities of your hero
but theres items to counter that
that it seems impossible to outplay your opponents at times
and auto attack enhancing items
theres so many targeted stuns
that it seems impossible to outplay your opponents at times
and auto attack enhancing items
theres so many targeted stuns
right?
since they just have simple kits that scale with items
so by having numbers you just kill them because its too hard for them to outplay you
which is terribly low
i think that stems from the mechanical difficulty of most dota characters
not too bad
a 6/10 design
that's like
so the whole game is about goon squadding
but it leads to MASSIVE snowballing
i like that a lot
yea
i like how the enemy loses gold when they die
ive played 2 games of dota
considering your job should be to watch over the lane
and moving out of your lane early is rather unintuitive
but they have no idea how to play the dota meta at all
then that person loses
and see who strikes first
like is the meta to play a waiting game
wait so is counter ganking more efficient than ganking?
of Warcraft 3
well its just the engine
just autoing sucks
I played dota and honestly the movement isn't that bad
and about right clicking
but its unintuitive to have to think about movement
I know its intentional
the movement and attacks are unresponsive
no its unintuitive
I'm pretty sure its his go to instinct
hes played over 10000 hours of league
yea he is
feels qt man
its very unintuitive
I guess you have to learn dota
ye
are you watching delta fox play dota miles
warrior
whats next
"warlock"
"lich"
"tusk"
"drow ranger"
every character just has a title
and uninspired
the character design is lame
well, maybe not
if the mechanics didn't suck
the game could be cool
its a shame
by design
but its cancer
apparently its a bit better now
why did they make csing a chore
its just so bad mechanically
that my hatred towards this game is justified
watching qt play dota makes me realize
ok man
lol
the FUCKING aom streamer

damn wtf
might work out
idk reinstall it
Ive been logged in
yea
they got smash 4 running on it but it was beyond poorly optimized
and tbh this is the only game ive heard about that even works on it well
it sucks for the most part
like the differences barely matter but I wish Nintendo would do pc releases
instead of this emulated version which isn't quite perfect
I wish Nintendo would release the real game for pc
its an emulation
at an fps that doesn't suck
you can now play breath of the wild on your pc

theyre metallic wings
yea

maybe I'm just upset about hex
tbh
okay not really
ikik I just like those cards
ik
imho
I think they should nerf cards in expansions rather than base cards
they just spam devolve
nobody really even plays hex anymore
Hex nerf is retarded and irrelevant
Imho

i just made my character edgy because this terraria
I didn't know that erics name was The Edge
like my terraria character
they wont revert it, they'll just weaken keystones and add more base stat runes
^
mhm
it'll just a be a few patches of cancer if its bad
they've had runes in the game forever
if it flops its not like they wont know how to fix it
i mean
i think theyre just trying something new
not sure
i don't like how impactful they seem to be
I was initially like you though
so theres variety or some shit
the way I see it is that they want to reinforce certain playstyles for champions
the rune
I didn't pick lulu to play perxie
but if it is ill be upset
I don't think it will be that extreme
yea theyre a little too impactful
maybe more I honestly don't know
theres like 6 runes you can take or something
and like 2 mid runes
they've only displayed keystones
theres going to be smaller runes
what?
yes
even yasuo
yea
theyre giving base stats back to champions
and not competitive
we can only hope that its fun

Bc I reacted to it on fb lul
Made me happy
That anna one tho
Ones that edgy people will get reliably 
They're safe edgy memes
JETT
Which is good and bad
Nett doesn't post any esoteric memes tho
you just need to be good
no random urf is good
ye
but I'm not gay
urf is for furries
fur is short for furry
urf = fur
that's a weird time to strangle it
weird
the woman is using her unborn child as a handrest
that's surprising
have you never seen this?
should I start the new game + lul
I'm very bored
honestly now that I don't have to beat tales of berseria
but that's how I'm justifying it
personally I give it a 9.5
its def a 9.5
but nah 9.5 out of 10 people would like it
the ending was weird
maybe 9
9.5
That is all
I beat my game
sarcasm?
then I showed it to uti
jimmy found it, tagged me in it
mars uti did not find that
But, of course!
Same 
Bro the beach is tiring
Dj khaled spare me
yuuup
this is unfortunately too true
or 10
but like on chapter 9
i did that with lucina
lol same
yea you could force an enemy encounter with them
then force the shitty ones to fight the risen
and deselect your good units
nah you gotta use reeking boxes
which is a weird dilemma
yea its hard not to have a few units do everything
was kinda rewarding
watching your op units kill everything
which was pretty fun in a different way
mhm
which can be hard honestly
you have to position better around more of your own units
how is it different really
wait what
which reinforces your reward for good positioning
the enemy phase doesn't matter as much either, since you can normally counter attack
yea it is
that's fair
but ik you don't like it much
even turn based combat suits me
e
its just relaxing enough to be my styl
nah I've always loved the gameplay in jrpgs
get on my level
it was 3rd degree sarcasm
: )
i only like it when its sprinkled in to good gameplay
but I don't watch anime!
same
and its done what ive feared
I bought this one
but like
but I never buy them anymore b/c they always consume me
I love jrpgs so much
and I'm alright with that
I haven't beaten the game tho so the story is just typical jrpg stuff rn
on the laptop
we're better now
Rip.
I'm on my phone and typing is a challenge because I plugged it in so it's lagging 
I think 
It's its own thing
No not really
Much better than berseria so far
The story is p good in nier
It's not completely mindless I guess
It's not completely mindless I g
Yea but there's a bit of strategy to it
The gameplay is mindless but so much fun, honestly better than nier
Yes.
Essentially
You play as the villain against good guys that do shady things
They're big
Nothing crazy for anime standards but for human standards
Yea mildly big titty
Basically a human with a giant claw that consumes other demons
It's a she demon
Yes
On pc bc my computer can run it
You play as a vengeance filled demon named velvet and your goal is to take down the establishment which is basically the church
I had my doubts but the game is good
No it's really good 
So yknow anime rpg
It's a jrpg
In the context of the game
That was actually such a good joke
Tales of berseria has consumed my life
me and shit
with uhh
lul
parsa's gf

and to avoid confusion, riot has stated that he is a top laner
david, urgot comes out tomorrow

You can't stop me. One does not simply quell the Shkrel.

yea
so you just have to move
but david the best part about new urgot is that his w seems like it will do a decent amount of the positioning for you
so the urgod can come out
allow the urgot in
mhm
but you got the point
at the end
that almost made sense
er
as much as possible
so you'll develop a connection with him
is that's its still urgot at heart
but what you're not understanding
than to play current urgot as much as possible
but what better way to train for his release
nah that's happening in 2 weeks
why did you only give kayn 1 bar of utility and nothing else
wtf riot
and check out the new champ

I love both of those champions vos so much

this riven skin is so good
angels are just better than demons but theyre still lame yes

but its still a good ass
its just armor

i feel like thats the kind of place you move to after saving up for a while
thats for sure
yea
its dope
but you're not wrong
which is why everythings so cheap
well the thing is that its hard to find a job that pays that much in Michigan
lmao
and still be able to reap the benefits of living near water
to avoid floods
you'd find me on a mountain next to the water
well actually
me too
mhm
but then you realize its unlivable due to the humidity and heat
its so tranquil
look at this shit
boating through the bayou
eating crawdads
dying of heat
Louisiana always seemed like a good meme
i guess Miami is okay
idk I still don't like florida
J U A N
and went on a tour
my friend matt lived close to rooster teeth
the people there are terrible
yea
theres no place worse than fucking florida
those places suck
in the winter
its always there
yea I guess lmao
without having to account for it
its just easier to plan out life
idk I don't mind extreme weather
I'd rather live in a temperate area and pay more
its may 31st and overcast as hell
rn
bro look outside
Kappa
you'd fit right in!!
but its still cool
Canada is a bit too frostbitten
I wouldn't live in an area that wasn't primarily English speaking
nobodys denying that
yea that area is pretty garbage
its still big
that mansion isn't that undesirable
wait cmon
for a w hile
dude I've always wanted to live in the mountains
i'd get tired of it every fucking year
to get snow
every 5 winters
I think it'd be nice like
^^
Colorado is a meme
from what I know
Minnesota has terrible weather
Washington might be a bit too cold
Oregon is definitely where I'm headed
p cheap in the countryside
nice weather
like Oregon maybe
that aren't here
there are some places that are nice
honestly tho
kappa
holy
72k for the cheapest
anyways
ofc
he didn't specify
a bit less
thats the bay area
that's not santa monica???
with all the work they're forced to do
theyre lucky to save up 50k
people don't save up 300k during their grad years lmao
ofc you get a loan if you're on your own
how else do people buy houses?
isn't even enough to own a place here
88k a year
^
fields
like 4 field can
maybe
2
^
its actually hard to read
you're so unrealistic
dude...
exactly
and people already work there
theyre just filling their departments
its not like they're constantly hiring
they aren't exactly vacant on workers
but like
.
with those companies
you could maybe give a job to every cs major at usc
that's not even all the cs majors
and only a small percentage of the population that has attended university in the CS field can work for google
its not even close to a typical entry level job
its unreal
you're so bad at this
eric
to own a place here with an entry level job
and be sponsored by your parents
you need to come from money
hes not wrong
^
AHHH
WTF
Edited previous message: 
that's maybe a 1bedroom apartments
you cant own a sm house with an entry level job
most of the time
not entry level jobs
its a struggle
otherwise
its great if you aren't playing for everything
yea actually I think I know that building
or ocean street places
those aren't beachfront properties
fine areas
the other two are just
yea ikr

unlucky
and going on and on about how much research shes done
but I remember my mom complaining about it
my sources are weak
yea
and shit
websites
actually its supposed to be slightly less expensive according to like
not cheap
it'll be affordable
no
one of the most expensive places in america
its legit like
rents way too expensive here
and that's gonna suck
I def cant move anywhere in santa monica

REEEEEEEE
but remember, its 5-10 champs
this is going into normal draft and ranked
yea 10
just another 30 seconds to eliminate duplicate bans
I think it'd be cool to allow the people who banned the same champions as their enemies to ban again
double bans
yea fizz
he's gonna suck dick next patch

like i did
or reading one
i guess you're right
playing an 18 yr old gamecube game
even tho its probably the nerdiest thing i could be donig
i felt so cool

just to play maplestory
im not about to turn on my old one
new computer
time to download maplestory
well
same
like hard liquor got it
that its not undrinkable
im surprised
that's pretty bad
wow
ive never tried redbull
while that's probably infallible
that's making me tired
or whatever this is
its even worse because I know its from me being "sick"
yea
and its kinda tilting
im unable to play well
but my league skills are waning
I would squad up
well, the idea of it does
Edited previous message: but im not sure if the actual game will be fun
but im not sure the actual game will be fun
the idea of it makes me smile
it helped last time
maplestory might help
im telling you
I'm not sure that would help though
no
maybe too much
I get so much sleep its unreal
neither of them helped
I tried both
would maplestory help?

roast him
I agree
same
it was overall 75 base damage for a .45 ratio increase
hmm
oh
wasnt it also a buff to the first hit?
but it wasn't just a .4 ratio
well it is debatable
lul
who would've guessed that a .8 ratio is better than .5 seconds of a silence
but increasing his ult damage
its like that time they "nerfed" kassadin by lowering his silence duration
is insane
hes even better than before
this is 110% what i needed
yee
its SO good
the pizza has arrived
I'm a ho
hmm
but its fast, effective, and fun!

ofc
if you were here
you wanna come over for some pizza
eric
I've had a few of those

its hard ordering pizza
yea
buying just one pizza is inefficient
the thing is
Edited previous message: currently the first one is pepperoni
its just not yet
well the second one COULD be pepperoni
the second one doesn't have a face yet
currently the first one is peperoni
just dominos pizza
i want it to have a nice personality
what type of pizza should the second one be?
hmm
the pizza will remain untended
nevermind
its nice knowing that someone will be here to take care of the pizza
feelsgoodman
if i order two pizzas from dominos will someone come over and eat the other one
i walk the dog, then buy pizza
i feel like its an immediate transfer of money
b/c I got paid to walk the dog
I think I'm gonna order some pizza now

that'd be op
no
EU casters LUL
Edited previous message: if you choose to abuse his range
if you choose to abuse hi range
due to his mana costs being so unforgiving early game
but he cant afford to stay at it
sure he has more range
azir is only good vs ori if your name is faker
you don't have faker on azir
this isn't korea
????
and I was like
the eu lcs casters were saying that azir does well vs ori
like an adcs
his tank damage is honestly just decent
unless you have a good front line
azir is countered by tanks actually
he fits the need
Kappa
maybe azir will be good again?
so unless adaptive is SUPER op
that's what I was saying earlier
or tanks will get blown up
so they need to lower them
as armor values increase % armor pen effectiveness increases
I guess that's alright
they're lowering the percent effectiveness tho
I'm not sure about that
so..
theyre nerfing last whisper and cleaver
if not great
and aps are gonne ba okay
ads are gonna suck
unless adaptive is crazy op
and adding adaptive help
making them less effective versus ap
and lowering health on armor items
they're increasing overall armor and lowering armor pen
b/c of the way that armor pen and armor stats are changing
I think that ads will be a bit weaker
looking back at the changes for mid season
they're all so lame
I hate playing ad assassins
Edited previous message: why the fuck would you ever want to increase you max health temporarily
why the fuck would you every want to increase you max health temporarily
right?
its pretty cheap
so I don't think itll be good on him
nobody focuses thresh
nah
galio or something
gargoyle stoneplate might be a niche pick for like
might help out with bursting adcs
the fact that ga is losing its mr
although
rip
really badly
also hurts azir
yea
or so
a weeks worth of time
you're talking about for like
you realize
that are really fucking strong
theyre adding some new mr items
but for this patch is it
I don't think it will be soon
Edited previous message: hes shit up there
shes shit up there
just never go azir top
for your top laner
that ruin it
but most of the time its the instalockers
and sometimes ad mids are really strong
you have to adapt to your team comp
its not like mid always picks first
go zed ffs
if your top locks in rumble
she needs a nerf
lulu is pretty op
kayle is bad lulu
no
lulu top is fun
Edited previous message: but then you have no kog protection
so the kog has to be a god
but then you have kog protection
if you have a kogmaw adc you can make ad mids work
ty
ad mids aren't good from a team comp perspective
bad fizz
akali is like
for the most people
so people just play assassins b/c theyre the most fun
theres actual diversity now
the thing is

maybe ww is tier 2
wait
ivern is SS tier
imo
ww is tier 3
nope
he's tier one top tho
he's tier 2
and gragas isn't tier 1 jungle
at level 2
its basically anyone who doesn't get cucked by lee
in diversity
jungle has always been lame
that's just one part of it
oh wait its not January LUL

She acts like shes 25
no, that's a bit far from what I was going for
I've never really thought about that
Stream you drawing pepes
its a weird thing to listen to
but that's not what she is in the slightest
she sounds like such a mom

Hmm, maybe this one is not ready...
Decided by interest, fueled by greed
No, maybe you wish to go on your own path?
A holy mission, perhaps?
Then perhaps you desire guidance?
Then what is it your heart desires?
Then what is it your heart desires?
Oh?
I do like the last hit system o.o
Oh?
none of us except one dude
never played it
they want to play the old one tho
tenn's hosting it
yea
what ever could i do!
im in a cyberpunk game today
xd
Delayed, check group chat
Yea same
pog
Highkey ^^
Except p
I was also on the borderline of each category
Inting lul
I remember I was intp on my tests
Yes, you aren't
No I am
oh hell yea
soon TM
i've been writing my own campaign too, actually
this sounds wonderful
we're doing it tonight
Just a warning 
I'll have little to say if we do it tonight and might fall asleep
But I'll just smoke, pass out, and hopefully wake up by 9
:)
I dont want to do it tonight because I dont think I'll be able to stay up very late unless I can successfully take a nap, and because we wont have collin
especially if we can get collin too
id rather do it tmrw afternoon tbh
At least imo
Yea, might as well just plan around getting all of us in
Also, if collin cant make tonight, is anything stopping us from just doing this tomorrow? We're all on quarantine time anyways lol
I'll check it out in a sec
Oh hell yea
My boy coulda fooled someone
Damn those signatures kinda look like Miles
if you simp for her, and she likes you, she'll simp for you too
I was lowkey hoping all knights of Carim were just simps for shrine maidens
So there was a shrine maiden? Pog
am i missing this piece of character lore?
and who does Lautrec protect?
oh?
is easily a pretty cool guy
any guy who can draw maidens wearing robes to him
he got that maiden clout
aight guess we're postponing it till 99
wankwankwankwankwank
none of you guys made a blood pact with her
was just my hunch
"i think the party is gonna kill her"
i just thought shed die so i told parsa shed likely die
i just thought shed die so i told parsa shed likely die
and this all stemmed from that
and her goal is in line with mine
otherwise i liked her dialogue enough to make a blood pact with her
the only thing i didnt like about rei is that she was another waifu-able character
^
i was chill with her, she fucked with me
didnt even ask me, who was gonna pay
didnt even ask me, who was gonna pay
b/c we said we would
tilts me
xd
and theyre all small girls
also true
YES
you are a murderhobo too? xd
i like chadius
lol
but you arent
which im cool with
yea thats why shes how she is
to how i wanted her to be
so im not even sure if its fitting to rewrite the character
lucia has too
collin LUL
i'd get cancer from others
and if i made her play like a want, a charmer
if i played lucia with a girly voice id get cancer from jett, just slightly
nonono
the past is just a ghost
constant ridicule like parsa faced
too many judgmental people imo
i went over that a long while ago
playing a female pc aint for me 
and it just tilts me
ive thought about trying to do that
am i just gonna change it on a dime?
very true
very true
which isnt necessarily a good problem solving tool
he frames everything in the most negative way possible
parsa just tilts you
gr8
we made a shitty blood pact
not rlly at least
i dont wanna kill her
xd
must kill?
too many of them
shes another small girl
i feel like thats what the plan wouldve been
i feel like thats what the plan wouldve been
can she conjure it in her sleep?
same
??
7/11 next year
nah 11
her right eye is now purple, but still blind
lucia took her eyepatch off
When I wasnt exhausted 
Yea I liked it, especially session 2 of it

You just havent done your summer reading xd
How blasphemous can ones words be!
I've even heard greater tales of fina
I've even heard greater tales of fina
But what proof do you have of iouns powers directly influencing you?
I'd say that alone is proof of his greatness
One of metallic property
Gemi gave me a shiny crest
You should ioun of gemi-- oh, wait, shes dead
Flourishing with perfect life
He has his own planet, they say
Must I repeat the tales of gemi the wise?
Proof?
Oh yea, same
Fina? The disciple of Gemi?
same
F
Me get salad
Duh
Nine elevelynn
or even a wizard
would make a great bard
that wacky dude
hell yea
just say a bunch of random shit that, if you're lucky, will be strung together in a way thats strangely profound
would be really fun
i think just making david byrne into a dnd character
fan art pog
yea its good art
vs the level of parsas mom
with the two halves
you can synchro summon a full parsa
in the character
its about the level of parsa
imo
cheqir was okay
xd
whod have thought that would help
ok we get it then yea
braccus
godfrey
s
assassin style
thats like
just more selective
i could be robbin hood but yknow
and rogues normally arent very good
i wanna go in as a rogue
ive played a lot of good characters
mayb all evil
must have one guy evil...2 mayb
i think gay but mayb not vro
bum dum duuuuuum
call him joke
joecab
deep 
i like having cooperative evil pcs personally
i think all good is a little anal
xd
fuck it im still calling him joe
jacob reigan needs to die
we need to see that
pog
we havent peaked yet
xd
somehow it always stays true
Hmmm
Oh wait nvm we're gonna be all good right
Ive already decided on my next character 
Brb
But chose not to
Y'all can outspeed a halfling 
Yea that was the play
Like an absolute goon
I started boots in the jg
Team left me
And was unable to
No I was told to tank them
He just got killed by wolves
I did like playing as victor ironflex
I like it
Constant scumbag
Amazing the classic
Xdd
And raid azure peak
So it's time to start acting like it
Currently I am
Then skyrim
The best wrpg I played is two worlds 
So that's I can do xd
Because I only ever played jrpgs
Mcs is a sad truth of mine
Xddd
Good call us
Oh right
Iirc
That was supposed to be this one
His version of good is just telling others what they should and shouldnt do
Ty for coming to my ted talk
That's my cop out
Xd
I let eric decide that
So imma carry it
But I keep being given shit to carry
Not a noble
I just made a cleric
It literally made no sense why he wanted to do that
That was just a weird character design
So everything he does is justified
Lowkey I'd rather just parsa be on chaotic evil
"this doesnt look like faerun anymore guys"
amazing
me gusta
i like meme shit
see i like that shit
too good not to be canon
from an off week
thats gotta be a penny quote
gl yoinking what is unyoinkable
yoinked back
makes sense
and that reason better be a good reason
2020 logic
they must be waiting for a reason
listen if the one who waits is waiting 
im hyped
lucia is the reason we get to experience bs like this
im just waiting for the one that waits
im just waiting for the one that waits
shes seen some shit
im ready to make lucia into a cold cutting bitch
is that iago was wrong
all we know from that
big facts
XDDD
but he was evil XD
^
i was gonna ask to go kill him on my off week LMFAO
for his head 
time to go ask 
ill never forget how stupid it was lmfao
against racist elves
the character was essentially black and got away with that shit
4head
just kill the guards
in the cell
and shouldve just let him die
we were just retarded about iago
i liked iago better
he talked too much
tilted me every session
i was so ready
i had the opportunity to
that was an awful character
listen i shouldve just killed noxalas
at all
totally not a headache for the dm
what a good player!!
yea
the tree dude is 5
his druid fuck left
yea sure buddy
"im not running it down, im just increasing my damage taken stat"
it was intin
gone to waste
two revivify uses
i even healed him twice
GOOD CALL US
WE KILLED HIM
OH RIGHT
inting = leaving
count
id say drakki and her inting
you did?
mustve been
yea lmfao
2 sessions?
oh how long did that last
who is valyra
i thought she was
valyra wasnt the fighter lady?
did drakki die?
just up and left
whatever his noxalas lookin as was
2 fucking characters
2 in my campaign
if he didnt do that it'd be less toxic
he did it this campaign too
only parsa
now you've posted cringe
king of the pirates
big krool
maybe theres a mod for kaede in dd
maybe theres a mod for kaede in dd
just like theres a dnd mod for kaede
but i can see the argument
i think thats a bit of a stretch
to the occult side of things
i guess kaede took a dark turn
a downright animal
jacob is the same beast behind a different name
:)
just like he needs
he'd have so much time to learn
immortal kaede is a good trait for kaede
thats very poggers for kaede
pog
three houses 
into time skip
azure peak
pog
i respecc
if i can see it
im much more likely to have a better understanding of it
if i can see it
good question
xd
i fk with that
whos a real player
oh you just want a servant
thats tolerable at least
okay
i think thats enough
when he does it in call for 5 seconds when hes speaking like hanzo
i dont want to hear parsa do a japanese accent for 3 hrs
genichiro xd
idk
could help us out with that
maybe of those manifestations of fear we've been talking to
^^
i respect kaedes opinions so we'll get along well
im okay with this
theyre too expansive
hydrius had a reason for destroying the ship xd
they just arent people ive learned to like
no jin me smash
i can feel it
morosov wants to create a plague
The plague of wuhan?
Could this be arranged?
Or should I say, the bad bad
Or should I say, the bad bad
You once had it, but the good good calls
Lucia is a wildcard
I think tonight that power was lost
It's just for the expression 
You know what I mean tho
Okay fine 
Otherwise imma have to hop on the train before it leaves the station
There better be a damn good reason xd
Next time penny says dont make a deal with a devil 
You raise a valuable argument
Hm
WE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY BOYS
Nah they dont know shit
In exchange for cool loot
Give them the knowledge of nilgesh
Or save myself for the ascended shurimans
And make some deals with devils
It's time to make some moves
Xd
Yes, who ever grew that beanstalk
And on that, gnight
Eventually a deal will be sweet enough 
Maybe I'll hype myself up to these guys and make them give me more
Lmfao
Xd
Outside of nilgesh
Is the best
Aight time to research these guys more to see which one
T h o u g h t s o 
So maybe having some protection would be nice
So maybe having some protection would be nice
But now I realize he'll likely just do that anyways
Because that fucker would definitely try to kill me
Well to be fair, selling out nilgesh's secrets had me sussed 
Lowkey I think siding with these guys is just a leap of faith
I got some recognition from otherworldly entities
About time
Oh
Wait that eye thing was a she?
This time was strange
Maybe next time xd
Whenever we're faced with one
We just seem to be against devils as a party 
I think lucia is gonna be on the fringe of both 
and just search EVERYWHERE
but for now i guess i'm planning to head to kator
maybe itll just turn up
gotcha
play to both sides to win yknow
she has the evil brooding eyepatch already
xd
N E U T R A L
now just to find the location of those relics
sick thats p cool actually
but hey maybe one day
we dont really have the means for these rituals
aight 6 charges gone then
they arent immediate threats though which is good
they arent immediate threats though which is good
xd
just shit that will one day find its way to our plant and kill everything
spoopy
ooh
So he can run his tests on me n shit
is there anything in there about creating a golem/abomination through rituals
I dont think I can learn the spells right
I dont think I can learn the spells right
Knowledge of nilgesh, relics, and rituals just in case theres a way I could cast a few
xddd
I'm also gonna go visit hanneman
I'm gonna talk to the arch bishop with the hopes of impressing her with my journey north and work towards getting an army to raid azure peak
And pick up my shield
Go to the orcs either in off week or at the start of the next session
I'm gonna go use my hourglass to look back at the book of ultimate evil and read the pages
This looks like a Christmas wishlist
very nice
I'm picking up a salad but I'll probably still be there on time
if we end up there by bs 
not against spreading disease in the jin empire
association is the first mistake you can make

that he can fuck around with
and has the ability to create a smaller shadow version of himself
maybe hes just fucking huge
ive always loved the tier together of them
and im set
gimme the void there too
yea!
i think its just about creating an idea of something and then making it come to life
yea also true
knowledge has a lot of different categories
and even then
so kaede could never have done a math problem in his life, but still be very very intelligent
so kaede could never have done a math problem in his life, but still be very very intelligent

thats why dnd is just a game
ogoat
only game of all time
best game of all time
^^^^
we shall find a place of rest eventually, i promise you
of how bad it actually is, this one even has the credits
watch this to get an idea
I beat the final boss, then it took me back to the title screen
I beat the final boss, then it took me back to the title screen

im sorry for what ive done to your family
this must be henry's nephew's house
when you fuck with tony
and this is what happens
this was taken in two worlds
Hol up, where your coat at?
Apologies Henry, lets get to work

TONY
i like kapish
but i was hoping for better than what i was offered
yea i know it isnt real
i rest my case
look
on google
and it says capeesh
b/c skype said it wasnt a real word
so i looked up how to spell capiche
capeesh?
just call him tony
please, thats his father
Tony lanzoni
He's tony
even collin knows tony
then you're the big gay
if you dont know tony
im traumatized 
tony lanzoni got fucked in a chase
no chase scenes? good
same
same for me, as well
im sure you would
if they can
nobody answers
but since things come up
i think people only say something when they cant make it
and scuffed
good
i, for one, would welcome any experience that puts me closer to our one true lord
which coast theres too many islands
is it at least part of the southern isles tho
I'm a fan of the map overall
The abyss looks cool tho
Can we visit there in the space expansion
Wheres planet gemi
ig
just later
magic land? also could be cool to visit
could be cool
magic city?
as long as we all agree its cool
not everything has to be an oc 
its a good decision
xd
thats why you know my vote
well theres only one real right answer here
I did a lot that eric left out from the synopsis
I lost an eye to learn that shit so you best know imma use it somehow
Why settle for worshiping a lich when we can just be one
I learned how to be ascend to lichdom from the book too
I want to visit the southern isles
i think my next goal is to slaughter the whole town of weebs
fuck yea the mayor is retarded
and he said "what can i do for you friend?"
rolled up to him in his custom armor set
while he was one room away from me
i also robbed the mayor
nobody saw it so it mustve have been suicide xd
very good meme
theres no penalty
and if you kill somebody behind closed doors
all merchants in the game have infinite gold
yes
now i have god tier armor
for money miles
which was worth like 10k gold
and i steal all their stuff
and so i kill her too
the bitch yells at me
and that the mayor killed her
then i go back and tell the first woman i met that her sister is dead
i tell the brother about my success
b/c thats what the brother wante
then i go back and kill the sister
so i do that get to gold
the sister told me to send her fathers will to the mayor
agreed
he was white in a city of asians
no
the brother said to go "deal" with his sister
b/c hes a blacksmith and hes sad
she said to help her brother
the guard told me about this woman who i could go see in the city
hates all outsiders and looks asian and shit
i went to a city thats essentially japan
and its been a good meme
ive been on two worlds all day
im not gonna lie tho
oh blessing
miles can u make it

wait so
If you think Lucia is worthless now
If you think Lucia is worthless now

We wouldnt be starting early for my schedule, but for miles
We wouldnt be starting early for my schedule, but for miles
I am free but if we can't that's cool too
Would we be able to start a bit earlier tmrw?
i just want to get this mask off me

which implies that its gender neutral right
b/c if its not labeled by gender it isnt labeled at all
writing gender neutral is the equivalent of writing nothing

i just dont like the terminology

or are the just bathrooms
but are they gender neutral

would we stare?
and it was just a screen
imagine if the screen wasnt showing any colors
so
like at least 50% of the time
we all stare at a stupid screen for hours on end
if you think about it
and i shut my eyelids just enough so theyd create rainbows when i looked at the sun
i had my cat on y lap
i looked at a tree
i did that today

But I'll be back eventually 
Lowkey I thought about how hard the bosses for the dlc were and just admitted to myself i wasnt ready
Botw might be better in atmosphere just slightly 
On steam 
And the best atmosphere on a game I've ever played
And it's a fucking amazing game
I still need to play ALL the dlc
True^
It's a tough call
Idk tho
Behind undertale
Probably number 2 
Is in my top 3 steam games of all time
Hollow knight
gl homie
mhm agreed
damb
9 at night?
no
but i have a doubled proficiency bonus in deception to convey sickness
imo
no just a 16 or higher
Dx
you already know that i dont know
thats how it is 
xd
so fun right?
idk yet
1030 am indeed
yea am
saturday is up in the air
sunday i have a shift at like 1030
I think we all said we would
if this angel is going around spreading false prophecies im there
or at least just kill them
whos down for going on a quick crusade?
whos down for going on a quick crusade?
well if its catholic, we must eliminate it
not a boy and a man, not a boy and a girl
he specifically chose two boys
the angel must be catholic
mars pick what ur heart desires
thats what i originally wanted to do anyways
and take out some fey
then i think id rather help the city calm the fuck down
my read is kinda off rn
im asking mars rlly
ik
oh shit is that more urgent?
then hell yea lets do that
well how urgent is the western towns call for aid?
so if we are doing fey
not sure on what i want to do yet
i get that
this is was better
gotcha
but no hes our priest
the way the paladin was described to me by parsa made me think i just had a second ally in battle
cool
need to adapt or make a new character
xd
wait we're adventures now right? fuck i got confused
essentially
i want to try and unlock the paladin
yea its a future goal
this is something i will acquire
but i guess we dont have a backup priest yet
i meant someone to take over for him
oh right lol i confused myself
gotcha, we dont have a qualified bishop yet?
seems like someone we'd want with us
yea why not
i dont want to change too many characters
yea
or is it the same
do we prepare quicker as adventurers? since we have less things to do
i wanna investigate the dark fey
gotcha
xd
of darkness
time to be a bishop
thats amazing
and demonite
time to fuck him and get him to drop more shadow scales
oh not him again
that was pretty much just parsa
nah i dont think so
xd
are the riegans an issue?
aight then
ez
through drugs i guess?
and i can see the purpose of relief
I mean just make sure the drugs arent gonna kill civilians
to raid azure peak
so i can create my own holy army
time to help guide those who wont follow the church into my reformist religion
its definitely better for the city
this would lowkey be the perfect time for a cartel but i respect the change of heart
aight thought so
does he still want to drug other nobles
are we keeping the drug subplot for house morosov?
why not double carrying capacity
ubuntu?
oh god
only ever made it to level 5 on barbarian
whats the trait
or stall the enemies movement with that giant radiant circle i have
while miles tanks the middle and i heal him
just flank the backline
double rogue comp you and mars
up to you elk could be amazing
bear is playing it safe
elk is L9 tbh
while elk might play in to your rogue bit
but bear is likely better for just going in
i think elk would be fucking hilarious
amazing
seems like a Good fellow
well shit im ready
gotcha
nvm
oh
is he a dwarf?
Oh my
and whats the name if you have one
what class?
i dont think i can see it
hell yea
seems like a good way to get back into it
i think itd be best if we werent evil, at least to try it
i think itd be best if we werent evil, at least to try it
i dont think anyones going evil tho
true
i think lautrec and penny are neutral right?
good or neutral imo
i feel like i should though
but idk what everyone else thinks
id rather stay level 7 because i never minded the scaling
but now you get to be a memer in the name of morosov just like the rest of us
just like how you did
but doesnt exactly dictate them
i think morosov makes more sense as a strong npc that overlooks our operations
i think you should switch tbh
Oh
But cant on mobile
I was gonna add him
but we changed it in the name of being reasonable
under 7 = 7
through pity on a 5
kinda big gay but we riding out here
still scuffed
we saved his stats
rolllll
miles get on
we're on hard mode
3 d 6
kinda big pog
level 1 3d6?
the return of eao
f
gonna have fun w/ me
are u not
considering it
make big boy calls
this is why we need you miles
we're talking about negusi now
no its done
miles to me
F
we're gonna spitball ideas
join call if you want
but you can just make the ssame shit
you have to reroll
old party is npc
yes
Oh god who
Xd
I said let's go get giants to help kill Joe riegan and we reset the campaign
I did I said let's go see the orcs and we did
Our party correct?
But I tried many times
Its hard to offer new shit when shit to do has already been decided
If you say no I'm sending mine to zimbabwe
Its op imo
Also eric can we remove the cloak of champions
This is pog as fuck
Oh shit
With this whole campaign 
I thought that was the very issue you had
She can still power word stun you
Parsa at level 15
At least for parsa
Keeps the problem the same
But the bishop being level 15
Okokokok
Sorry just woke up 
I agree with jett
The communication was lacking
We already discussed this to death parsa 
And kill joe riegan
And to go see the giants
I've been pushing to go out in the world to see the orcs like 20x
I'd rather be out in the world anyways, I told parsa that the most fun I've had is the session with the orcs. The second most fun was session 1
Which is fine to just leave sometimes tbh
The whole point of this campaign is that this is our home base
Well it depends if the town scales up with us as time goes on
But in the end we'll just get right back to this spot
That actually more interesting in a way
I think I'm okay with the outside world being difficult too
The same way I can play a level 3 in a land of city guards
The same way I can play a level 3 in a land of city guards
But I think I can get away with being level 7 in a land of level 9s
I'm down though, and I do know why it's a good idea
Imo the level setback is pointless. But I'm down if it creates more autonomy within the group. Changing characters tends to decrease autonomy but its not like any of our pcs had a REAL connection with morosov
id rather the ruins have shit though
the barrenness does not scare me away from adventure
aight im out
g-nobles
would they be
hey wait thats unfair i cant do my one and only option against them
or are they ghost types
can i still step on them
did you get a response
well you asked him
and i fk with that hard
vyrmias doesnt use spells he uses magic
can i run with them facing down
real man mode hours
can i banish it
cool
if we're going
its MY TIME
oh god oh fuck all the heats on me
but no loot isnt really worth it now is it
i heard the rumors
retake the holy land or die trying
lets raid azure peak
guys i have a genius move
no fuck you
im ready to delve into the ruins
aight have a good rest homie
but yea
xd
there it is
LDQWKIMFQWUJ9FUWEFNUJWE
xd
is in range of nami?
thank you boomer
who can fake it till she makes it
except a goody two shoes cleric
xdd
yea but i dont do that
and causes roadbumps
irregular
but like
which can be healthy
and we lose what we relied on
so he loses his position as a dominant player
imo the swapping just makes it confusing for him
so idk
but i liked last session
the campaign gets rougher
whenever he swaps characters
true^^
listening to 2pac
fell asleep at 130
i just woke up
thats a serious fuckin debuff
it removes eyestrain
its broken
so i'll likely just sleep
im officially doing nothing tonight
or do you think its doomed
btw miles do you want to run for the captain of the guard election
btw miles do you want to run for the captain of the guard election
lets wait until a member of the petty gets accepted or denied a position
alright sounds good
i could sneak in through a cart theyre pushing
if one of the members of the petty gets a job there
the CLASSIC
okay
spear pog
well parsa can cast fly
well parsa can cast fly
and has detect magic
yea thats suss
then take a short rest
but jett could cast fly on me and dimension door on you
as you could assume
i do not own any
HMMM
i lack catlike dexterity
only better than average
uhhh
how i miss him so
gemi did
nope
im down
it does last 10 minutes
but guess who can xd
ah
its a ritual spell btw so 
i can help with the scouting of magical traps
i have detect magic
im tired im just gonna get some rest
si
but this was already said essentially
this too
this too
^
i think noxalas wouldve been good for that
agreed
i dont really want to go as a lobbyist for the dwarf on behalf of lord morosov
unless its jett who could stand from gaining status with the other nobles and would actually be able to meet with them
yea that could be more useful than lobbying [for free] for the captain of the guard
see i can agree with that mars
i dont see much value in it either eway
having the left or right candidate in captain of the guard
dude its captain of the guard
then run again if we lose
the mission is to run
otherwise i dont care either
yes
mars
i was subtly thinking this too
so thats my stance
yes
about the hresvelgs
ive only heard bad things
though
we know his family
we just dont know them
its not like we love the dwarves
well we just know chad
and we know each other
we dont know them
yes
i dont care about doing it
i agree with mars
no but
so its hard to say i want to just go all in on him
i guess the issue is that i know nothing about the dwarf man
so dont get offended i was just agreeing
sarcastically
it wasnt meant
i just want to know
autism?
yea obviously
so long as we have proper scouting
i think its really got some good chances of success
the first part for sure
this honestly could all fall apart
i think we need to see how well our plan goes down
at the very least
itll give us a direction on how to win next election
ehh i guess but i do want to try
or the best strat
figure out how to get elected
we want constructive planning
im glad we learned it wouldnt work tho
same
yea so that kinda shocked me but i understand
and i lost my train of thought
the tone shifted
im just confused now
hm?
w/ something like that
if it doesnt make sense
look just assume we missed reading it
we just dont instill the dragon then
dang
me either
or some shit then its obvious
if you do it in the middle of the street
but i see what hes saying
thats what i was thinking tbh
okay but where do we have him arrested
lmao
wtf
dude
i believe in us
yes
by attacking him with the guard
we save the city
so then we kill him
^^^^
that part confuses me too
see
go on
its true
LMAOOOO
its a chaotic situation
not at all
that changes a lot
oh
if we say hes actually a dragon
imagine the chaos
if joe riegan isnt actually joe riegan than we can just convict him or some shit
but joe riegan wasnt a dragon before either
and that riegans been dead for years
and that riegans been dead for years
well we could just say that its the dragon whos been doing all the crimes the whole time
thats not really slaying it
but how does that get us dragon clout 
yes
go
i just thought of that rn
no mars has the plan
right right^
ye
mars go
or
and we set up a kill
attacks the city
then the dragon
he socializes and gets his name around
jett gets to know people
yes
by killing a dragon
to win with the c lout we receive 
we want to try
thatd make him seem way more like a badass
so if we ever do kill the dragon he'll have people know who he is first
maybe this week he could spend time socializing 
jett has to build his way up there
and show we're way cooler than the established dipshits
and show we're way cooler than the established dipshits
we could try to s o c i a l i z e
we dont know the number of candidates
also true
oh shit
yea but we can try our best! xd
that would help our chances
exactly
yea but i think itll be fun
im just going with that shit other players say
im just going with that shit other players say
and trying to agree with it
^^^
xd
but mars can!
thats why im not assisting with miren
thats when im likeliest to be caught
just not trying to do killing in the city
okay
yknow
but maybe its not as hard as i think
for some reason if that gets found out i feel like we're fucked
i just dont want to kill the captain of the guard really?
it is a good point tho
lmao 
no
this is a good position
that shit isnt gonna happen for years
yea but how often does the captain of the guard retire
then what
wait you mean with two people?
after we figured out which spaghetti we're using
well we were going to do that
thats the only reason tho otherwise i like your plans
so then you essentially flame us for typing
because it can seem like theres no room for anyone else to say anything
its definitely a backwards order tho
^
like who would you run or what would you do
if you have an opinion parsa share it
he just flamed 
well he didnt really offer a solution
imoimo
true but those are self created accidents
did jett say he wanted to? I think he did right
or which ones do
i wanna know if they wanna run tho still
I could help get him there if he is
if hes interested in running
Alright I think he should try and go see Meira during his off week
yea
or do you still think miles
does it influence your opinion at all?
well shit i guess its time to do/promise some favors and gain some loyalty
but lowkey its just about convincing the people on the board isnt it
what do you think
but lautrec would if he renounced his religion but thatll never happen
but lautrec would if he renounced his religion but thatll never happen
i think mikael has the best shot tho
i think mikael has the best shot tho
and i dont fit the military man image
im a bishop which is a different type of position than a knight or smth
but im not seen as a soldier/captain
i could run off of my connection to the church
but he does have the military man image done very well
but he is rather new and has no connections
this would essentially just be a massive promotion for him
and being signed under a noble house
adrian could run off having military experience already
I think that mikael could run for this spot for a few reasons
I think that mikael could run for this spot for a few reasons
3 he has leadership experience from being a leader of a noble house
but these are nobles so maybe their biases are above that
people think military and think military man
2 hes a guy
and we'd all suffer from the curse of being under it
although it isnt a respected house its still a noble house and hes the head of it
1, the house morosov brand is essentially on all of us
xdd
isnt true
that just
no
like srsly
what kind of archbishop votes for a heretic
what kind of archbishop votes for a heretic
thats what ive been saying
but are the nobles followers of the church of seiros
but are the nobles followers of the church of seiros
yea
if it goes down far enough miles could win
the nobles arent just gonna go against the dominant religious force
67 is still kinda high
or 75 or smth
church love
82%
isnt the city at like
just the people voting will likely say no
there doesnt have to be anything wrong with it
its like a black guy running for president in the 1920s
still a heretic
he does
indeed
he has good battle sense and hes a knight
he has good battle sense and hes a knight
if he does i trust him
we should wait and see if miles thinks he can win
and i dont want chad winning
i could be wrong
imo
at least in these circumstances
but hes unelectable
hes a paladin
look i agree that hes the best fit
im aware
yes
by yourself
then you essentially decide the vote
if we do it like this
double brackets
look thats not
otherwise lets just hope we arent retards
ill make double brackets during the session if we cant decide
yea
im too lazy to wait for everyones votes on double brackets
we'll just discuss it
nah
two brackets
wait i have a better idea
i mean
i mean
somebody might not want to vote themselves
a strawpoll
im making
so we can help them get elected
we should decide that now
so whos gonna run
of telling people with votes that we'll do shit for them
and through manipulation
or is it just on our good name
and try to win over the council
so do we get to do speeches
i wasnt expecting to get their votes
yea i gotcha
also does anyone think its a good idea
or nah
wait so do you want to try that 300iq plan
you just need confidence in your deception
i support it
hey if you can pull off the bluff
then have a massive vengeance against us
or just kill everyone and run away
shapechange into something else
couldnt he just like
lmfao
then i could just do it
id just need her consent
but if i were captain of the guard
yea
to reclaim the holy land
i would immediately start readying a march to azure peak
but lautrec would too
i think jett would be a good captain of the guard
running
okay so i could see jett miles and i
or ex knight or something
right?
hes already a knight tho
already
he is tho
i just think theyd hate his worship of fina 
but im not against him running
the person they wont elect
im have church ties
jett is a noble
parsa has military experience
lautrec
bt
anyone
anyone but lautrec honestly
me? jett? you? parsa?
okay but who goes for the spot
AND IT COULD BE US
one day theyll win
ah the independent of the group
not CHAD
NO
so theyd have a hard time saying that i didnt remove the surge elemental
thats proof we're elemental slayers
well we still have the earth primal bead
id say so
a dragonslayer?
who would have the best chance
they get counted and burned in fire
a bunch of boomers throw their votes in a vase
yea so its typical church shit
oh no hes broken
suffer humiliation 
yea
r u blind
of getting appointed
i know its not an election but more people still increases our chances
especially if one of you guys is running against me
i wouldnt be against trying to apply for that
yknow
not wrong actually
aint that the truth
not one that we hand deliver to them at least
i also dont want the church to somehow start using a dragon in any of their experiments
i also dont want the church to somehow start using a dragon in any of their experiments

oh wait
dont want people shouting revenge unless theyre mass murders
i try to keep my ties healthy
b/c i dont roll like that to people who help me
it does if he helps us kill them
now either we call the religious police on him
now either we call the religious police on him
or we fucking kill some riegans
he's been a terrible guest
wait you're right
we didnt mean to invite a dragon
sorta
we invited him into our home
but i dont wanna do him like that
religious police are a threat
theyre essentially the second police
oh
im happy for the farmers
its doable
the one we got rid of
hydrius
how much livestock was he eating
im correcting my mistakes on the economy
pog
lmfao
i need to learn how to brew the potion for my rune afterall
week 2 alchemy lessons? pog
ooh
but i honestly didnt want to add anymore technicalities to our deal
i was gonna ask for the earth bead too
so i've created a rare hybrid
ohhh
its ineffective
you know im used to that tho
but i agree
hes a dota player
he just likes flaming
i told him hes not in my acid trip
and get him out of our hair, but remain on friendly terms
the plan is to eventually get him to the ocean
and starting an ice age
no he said hes afraid of it eating cows
then my b
which could theoretically happen in nature
dude if something goes catastrophically wrong from a surge elemental consuming a storm elemental bead
and it said itll help me when im in need
then i gave it a bead
i wasnt even there
it helped us in the citadel 
look i brought it to the river
if it doesnt i fkd up and im willing to hold that L
in the hope that it pays off
im willing to take this risk
i already said that you fear what you cannot immediately control
yes
adrian right
for nothing either
i didnt give away my bead
the art of the deal bb
whats your characters name again
thats why hes a necromancer
parsa fears what he cannot immediately control
^^^
it was already dangerous
b/c i can just say no you
which im okay with
for belittling my decisions
he has a hard on
b/c
n o y o u
c h a o t i c
yes
who believes she does good but isnt always right
a chaotic character
plot
the
drive
yes thats also good
imo thats superior
now i have a one time summoning of a typhoon elemental
no i had a better solution
wtf
i even wrote that
yea i did
and gets tied back to me
then a surge elemental that gets caught by mages
id rather have a super strong but insanely chaotic friend
and im trying to make some solutions
we have probelms
and talked to him
i went
wait i did do something about it
what id do
thats exactly
yes
or some shit
Then he'll show my pictures of his kids
"Love from Hydrius at the Boiling Lake!"
i'll get a postcard about it or something
look if he doesnt something worse over there
eating animals for food
well its no different than a dragon
lets hear your hypothetical
aight
yea thats fine
thats not close right
yea he can chill there
"I'll miss you, Hyrdius~"
Then I give him the bead and give him my goodbyes
i rolled
im on fumemort 
insight check? xd
I ask him if he's leaving if i do
^
And he isnt potentially fucking with our farmers
He gets to grow stronger
I think its a good call
If I find one I'll assure him that I'll let him know asap
I'll be on the lookout for a light/life/arcana/time elemental too
because we're friends
That sounds fair, I assure him I wouldnt ask him to risk his own life on behalf of mine for a some bead
he knows that
hes just paranoid
or no
Yea but the mages are onto him no?
The mages are threatening his life not mine
The mages are threatening his life not mine
Im not going to give him something for behaving improperly
He's already risking doing that on his own currently, if he wants the bead he'll have to heed my call when I ask
any time after that if he wishes to come to me it will be on his own will
Just once
I will agree to give him the bead if he promises to heed my call when I'm in need
is it possible to sending hydrius
if he can be free that works fine with me
if there is one, that is
and the paladin will come too
I ask if he would like to be accompanied on his the way to the sea so I could help him conquer whatever elemental is there
you arent in my acid trip
shh
or leave the hole there like the hole in my heart hydrius is leaving rn
or some shit
and refill the hole
out
i can take it our
Hydrius, my elemental friend, if I give you this bead will you agree to move towards the sea? With this I assume you would be granted mobility over land, so if your path would dictate that you cross over our lovely city I beg of you to go around it. 
it needs to be done regardless
well
off week
off week
actually nvm
sounds more fun
ill ask him in session
i am too
so long as youre willing to give it up
i can ask him if he wants it tho
doesnt get the multiplier
i feel like its a waste
yea but since he isnt storm
fuck him up
plan c
thats plan b
and since hydrius has been growing he'll likely win
and have them duke it out
what if we summon a second surge elemental
wait
which is?
idk if hes a total dick now
or theoretically we could have one
then we have a companion in the ocean
and give him food n shit until he can go to the ocean
gonna try and plea with him then strike a deal
alright i have my one chance back
so long as he doesnt fuck the city
wait we could also grow him
and get a primal surge bead
its time to 1v5 him
guys
this is doomed
oh wtf
im gonna have a 1 on 1 with him
nono i understand hes hungry
listen buddy its my buddy
what i learned i do not know
i did some research
or do i have to bring some back
can i buy imported water anywhere in the city
then get on a deeper level of emotional connection with him
and smoke some fumemort
gonna get some vials of imported water or some shit
my first one
aight im spending my offweek with hydrius
dang
aight
Or can none of us do that yet
Also, do we have any way of brainwashing one member of the army who we choose to "spare" to tell a false tale to everyone else about what happened there
Unless we know we can wipe them all out
Unless we know we can wipe them all out
But I dont want to be associated with killing government officials if it comes down to it
I dont think the government can deal with a surprise green dragon too
Who's gonna try and stop us
Actually we might just be able to
Aight that works too but itll be hard to get the giants there right. We cant just travel the country side with giants, can we?
And earn their respect for another time
Do we still want to kill the giants and befriend the red foot tribe
Aight if that's the plan I'm down
Just tell him the truth?
And how do we get the dragon to travel with us to intercept and kill joe riegan
Right as the next session starts?
So when do we wanna do it
So plan A it is
True.
I dont think he can just conquer and get away with it
How is he gonna own the place if he isnt a riegan
Is that how it works tho? I mean I guess he could turn himself into a chadlike being that is associated with the major riegan bloodlines or some shit
Is that how it works tho? I mean I guess he could turn himself into a chadlike being that is associated with the major riegan bloodlines or some shit
I dont get what you mean, in what way does him thinking that all 700 will come back make him not want to take part in it
I dont get what you mean, in what way does him thinking that all 700 will come back make him not want to take part in it
He knows that he can shapeshift into a riegan
Okay that's plan number 1 then
Okay that's plan number 1 then
Let's figure it out that's why we're here rn
Just tell him however much time we need
Dude the hour is flexible 
And none of us can fight him
So I want him out
I just dont like our chefs randomly disappearing 
But if you dont want to use the dragon we dont have to
No we tell him an hour but finish the mission in like 30-45 minutes
Tell him to meet us there an hour after the break in 
Sure it does you just do that first and then we go back for the dragon when the coast is clear 
But we have to present it in a way that doesnt allow him realize he can likely just do this by himself
I'm pretty sure he wouldnt turn down an opportunity like this 
Or some shit
But wed have to reach some kind of agreement 
It's kinda 200iq
Also we could alternatively assassinate miran riegan and have the dragon take over mirans form without anyone knowing
And I think it would be a good idea to ask the dragon for help with the promise that he can take over house riegan so long as he maintains a stable and friendly relationship with us via contract or some shit
I think it could be useful to spare one to tell the tale of we have a way to brainwash him into not remembering who committed the crime 
SO we intercept him and kill his smaller batch of men.
So his plan will probably be to come back home for a while to mourn, but then head back out eventually 
So his plan will probably be to come back home for a while to mourn, but then head back out eventually 
He wouldnt try and rush 700 men back home asap, especially if it jeopardizes his business ventures 
Well he has to have somebody he trusts with him on the trail
And we can assume he'll likely take a small but rather powerful subsection of his men to accompany him back home
Hell likely leave behind a good deal of his men to carry out his goals, likely leaving behind a trusted right hand man in charge of the people
He doesnt have a dragon with him either 
Okay well we can only assume he'll rush home if miran dies unexpectedly 
So its gonna be penny and morozov going into the riegan estate. The petty is gonna help you guys not get caught. Jett is gonna dimension door mara and himself into mirans room and attempt to kill him in his sleep
So its gonna be penny and morozov going into the riegan estate. The petty is gonna help you guys not get caught. Jett is gonna dimension door mara and himself into mirans room and attempt to kill him in his sleep
Timing is gonna be key for something like this imo
And when.
Well let's figure out how miran is going down then
We gotta start setting the plan in motion 
Oh fuck okay. Will joe riegan have left the other city by then?
we'll let her slide
oh they like her?
take her out
But hey gl
Way easier to get caught if you're fighting the guard
Isnt the goal to avoid the guards
I thought it was a stealth mission tho
But I believe in you
I dont know personally
Ok but wtf are they gonna do for your mission
Looks like I gotta help then huh
Pls
Dont give gold to npcs
yea lol
which is good enough for me
but it could theoretically help
true
it might be nice to have some alarms on the house
if we're growing then people might try and start robbing us soon
not a bad idea
id say we should at least get a cook and i guess we try our best to protect him
oh shit the stuffs just in the ground?
it could be really useful tho not saying it wouldnt be
so aka back to the smorcs
but can i destroy it? since its a magic item doesnt it need to go back to where it was made to be destroyed or some shit
nah i dont really need it tho
which hasnt come up yet
its a magic item, i get 10 minutes of blindsight when activating it
b/c theyll likely be offended 
i wear it there
also miles can have the cloak on the condition that if we ever go back to see the orcs
but i do like the name
im looking to trade it out
btw my elf fucker isnt very useful
Same but I like them better :)
But its changing I tell you
There are so many reasons you could be right that I cant disagree
But for now I am dealing with hyper powered shits

Good to know
Cool
When he had no weapons all becuase the guard didnt want to do the paperwork to kill him
Parsa broke curfew, attacked 6 guards, attacked a guard with inflict wounds in jail, and then got out with normal bail on behalf of a threat to said guard
Pog
Nonono
You traitor 
It is ok
Nice
Wizardo uno
Wizardo uno
Because I tried to rationalize a somewhat irrational and fantasy based situation 
Or it did for me
Which is fine, just makes the tone hard to read at first
We learned from his survival rather than his fall
So I guess now we know that even though he did it and lived, we shouldnt do it
Yea that's what I'm saying
Which leads to a dangerous game pace
So all I know now is that I can do that too
The punishment was rationalized well tho
Or to me it is
Yea but his character deciding to do that is unrealistic
Not tried to kill himself 
Well, went into a 1v6 fight that he likely knew he couldn't win
But he only tried to kill himself because he doesnt have to care about his life, knowing he can just come back
Yea but now we know that becuase his character tried to kill himself
Which is fine but it's just different now
So the tone changes
But he didnt die
And these cops are racist
Yea but hes black in game
Or took 4 turns
Like if we were 3v10
But if the circumstances were different the guards would totally have murdered us
For us too that the guards wont murder us
So it sets the tone
But it's not like the guards are gonna murder him right?
That feels weird too
Then we just bailed him out
Yea but he went in 1v6
But it's a weird dilemma 
It can be cool if they die yea
Like characters that is
Imo
It's weird playing with people who have total disregard for their own safety
And if you limit them in any way then you're limiting a person forever
And if you limit them in any way then you're limiting a person forever
Not for a session
The dilemma is that you essentially have infinite lives
That's fine
And dont try to preserve themselves
But maybe you dont like these characters because they're crazy
So why not int
Like theres no punishment for inting
That always feels weird to me
As a warlock buff
That pact of the blade armor shit is cool
And I'm very fine with that decision
But it doesnt need shit
Or its could be seen as modernizing some classes 
But the way they did it could be seen as bitch made
Yea it's essentially a balance patch
I like the beast master ranger change. Being able to revive your beast faster is nice and makes more sense now as a spell slot rather than with gold. And the fact that it looks however you want is pretty cool too
F
200iq 
ez
xd
xd
you guys have 15 minutes to decide
im going to the atm rn
no oppression points
that means you arent even an island
austria isnt even australia 
how does that make you feel bibba Miles 
god bless america
but you can take a break from representing your race right
[b]erhaps
im taking a gamer break
dont have steam either
and id rather dnd over begrudgingly reinstalling league
im not doing anything tonight
i could
same
lets enforce terminal velocity rules
terminal velocity seems to happen at around 1500 ft
its decent but not absurd
dang that really isnt as strong as i thought
dang that really isnt as strong as i thought
true
lmfao
oh wait, fly and suggestion are both concentration
i dont understand warlocks
to use suggestion, fly, and dimension door
to use suggestion, fly, and dimension door
does he have enough spell slots
its broken take it
^
since it lasts longer its just easier to use that
suggestion makes sense too
i could see it
since the target has to be willing, you can issue the command to follow or even obey
since the target has to be willing, you can issue the command to follow or even obey
and drop bitches
along with dimension door
jett you could totally use the command spell
fk ur doors
why would we take your doors now
so you just lie to us
theyre likely heretics
id just need to to make sure they're not set free immediately
I still have a plan for setting them free, though
well i didnt meet them, i could only assume
just thought about it some more, i could see a way i could benefit from holy soldiers
if you cant think of anything, i could assist you if you agree to lend me their aid when i need it
if you want to just set them free, know that i wont help with that
idk how else this will slide with the church
unless you do very well to hide them, and i can retrain them in the ways of seiros
well then fuck them
i think i could use them to help us reclaim land eventually
ive been doing some research at the church's library about holy sites
i think id rather just watch them starve to aid the church of seiros, but i wont stop you from locking them up either
but i dont want to have a ton of fina worshipers running around
okay i think thats fair
they have a connection to miles, so you think we could recruit them?
am i missing something? these are enemies of the church right, why would i save them?
all im saying is i see this as a benefit to my mission
they will likely fear the ones with the strength capable to do something like this
but it does matter who kills them
if so, it could prove beneficial to raise the standing of the church among the people
do you think the public would enjoy watching this execution?
very true
if we're in a team against him there wouldnt ever really be a chance though, id assume
you know thats actually not a bad idea
true i forgot its only 1 minute
cloak rogue with a bow vs flying warlock
thatd be a really cool fight tbh
ah dang you could just hide in a house
sounds like a hard fight
yea but he gets fireball and eldrich blast
itll be hard for you to get him down
if he gets up there
at 150 range? 
jett can literally fly
or fireball lol
if i can kite you for a round i could get some quick dmg in
yea im also gonna be hard to take down if we dont meet in a back alley somewhere
i havent given miles the cloak either
insane dmg rogue tbh
theres so much use in saving them
if that is what you wish to see, then we may have a conflict of interest here
we can welcome them to the faith militant regardless of status
correct?
to clarify, this about the common folk
of course
so we can use them as soldiers of faith later
save the people
like of interest
whats on it
nice
Lowkey my favorite spell
Dimension door is Pog as fuck
very fair
oh wtf i missed that line about getting their tongues cut out
because its the most virtuous thing to do, of course
after my good deeds i feel like i need to capitalize off that shit and get all buddy buddy with the church
I should ask the arch bishop to show me around
is all about
thats what being devout
It just works.
It makes sense for mine to be 7 just because
I guess if parsas character is 7 after 1 session
Aight 
Imo deserved but up to eric
Unless I'm getting free milestone points
I have spirit guardians but I am indeed a level 6 cleric
Ez
Let's just enter 3v2 combat to decide how we'll act towards the bishop 
i assumed we did, i didnt join you guys tho maybe thats why he said yes? i think we do tho
lowkey for that church rep
can i spend my week helping the priests calm the city
I'd def tell you guys
So I cant say for certain, but eric might tell you as if I were there?
I wasnt told what my research yielded
That's a crazy debuff
Mars getting pizza gl party

No its sludge feast
But I agree with you
Well its short
I'm not sure if that's the name of the zine or not tho
The event is called sludgefeast
It's a magazine filled with images from artists. This ones theme is Halloween but theres no skeletons. Win win

well then its up to you
dang
is noxalas at least evil?
very fair
me too lol
session 1
i shouldve quit the party from like
dude im a good cleric
and our jobs
therefore its better for me to help to not jeopardize the estate
i saw that, whether i helped or not, penny was going in
thats why i said yes originally 
league is sad life
nah only to us

oh
nvm
and im helpful
i see that you need some help
yea im in
i have range
supporty stuff
but i'll do whatever you need me to
im not the stealthiest, so going in with you might end up just screwing us over
and jeopardize the business
gotta make sure you dont get caught
no i'll help
its sike.
sike
rq
psych 
XDDD
i'll just make sure you get killed
look since i cant stop you
xd
true, im just an accomplice 
its doomed
welp
i'll help tho
and lets move on with our lives
lets just not let anyone find out about this
yknow better yet
which is very illegal
the dukes eye sucks dick
like
so i can do this w/o a guilty conscience 
i want you to spread a rumor
okay i dont want money
wtf why are we killing him then
find some dirt on him and i'm in
but its not the wave yknow
every good cleric has done that at some point
i mean i COULD make something up
otherwise im shady as fuck
i need shit that the public knows
everyones a sinner at some point
if theyre a sinner count me in
explains a lot HUH
thats how we know him
those are the stories told about him
true
half aasimar
when he turned into a half elf
think it ended up being chaotic good
i respect that about gemi
i respect that about gemi
he truly did whatever he wanted
but he followed his own path
highkey just lied to anyone and everyone
he just saw an upgrade and took it
no he really didnt care about it
yea but he wouldnt admit it
he was like "oh genocide w/e we can probably just ignore it lol"
xd
or i didnt let him know
he just didnt know what it really meant
no im telling you he knew what he was doing
so he is just an asshole really
i'll say that he considered his own life more valuable than those who he did not know
hey
just as focused on a self preservationist lifestyle***
just as focused on a self preservationist lifestyle***
theyre just as dumb, id hope
but his followers? oh yea
xd
hey i may or may not be related
i dont he ever committed gemi-cide either
even if he was retarded on some accounts, he didnt like flooding cities
even if he was retarded on some accounts, he didnt like flooding cities
yea he actually wouldnt like that very much
likely excommunicated 
my standing in the church would be fucked
if they ever found out it was me
i dont actually want to nuke the river
i didnt know i gotchu now
ah dang

Good. Christian. Teachings.
the academy?
whats the best place to do that
lucia wants to do research on surge elementals
I'm honestly down to make the sessions like a reconvening moment once a month or so
I'm down
Yes
yoink
Hey I'm good :)
elf fucker
its really good
miles did you make that meme
Also I cant rally behind a chaotic retard
It seems more fitting
I like chaotic retard
Maybe it's just me
These guys are legends
These guys are legends
They know wassup
Eyyy
[B]erhaps
optimal outcome imho
and we got through it alive
nobody said anything about illusions
hey
jebaited
welp it was an illusion then
or it wasnt looking at us yet
xd
but it def shaped my mindset
was just an oversight i assume
the one that started the attack
not the one on the floor tho
and were within like 70 ft or smth
like they hate light
im still surprised that they didnt see the light i was shining
then i got all the bis gear
that was a meme
i set off the drows and got to stay at full health
yea
new name
actually fucked
this is the power of friendship
holey
itd really be
ooh
well ours
but didnt mine get fused
i was thinking that we have the stone one
like this
idk lucia def wants more artifacts
cloak sorry
you know what the robe does now
they gave you a robe tho
xd
thats why i pray to gemi
i wanna learn some shamanism tbh
i wanna learn some shamanism tbh
if theyre down to teach im down to learn
HMMM
i wanna try to figure out a way to convince them that my god says its okay so the treaty doesnt matter
im down for that too
and i like what they have going
they seem wise in their own ways
they def do
and most of all, loyal
ruin their mentals but make them big
xd
dont act like you wouldnt
to wanna turn
so they see me as a fit example and see me as convincing enough
and i'd have to do something incredible
but obviously not the whole tribe
against the nazi orcs

Dear Friends,

	I apologize for being unable to meet you in person. Unfortunate matters have drawn me away from the city for the time being. I have instructed my butler, Harold, to provide you with any assistance my limited estate can offer.



Best,

Adrian Al-Loren

18th of March, 1127

Information from Harold Bilard:

-Adrian Loren left the morning of April 18th, shortly after meeting with you the first time, due to being called away by an important family member living in Elmmoor
-Shipments are carried in caravans from the Duchy of Auren by House Loren staff and accompanied by the Firegarde Mercenaries hired
Shipments carry spices such as bruise lavender, dragonmoss, pygmymint, etc. But also carried a rare spice only imported by House Loren, Storm Ettarel, which is commonly used in a potion that slows aging.
For 6 months, roughly one in four shipments have disappeared which has cost the house a huge amount of money. Usual shipments arrive every week with ~4-6k gp worth of spice. They are purchased from the nomadic Diamond Scorpion tribe at 2/3rds of the selling price with another 1/6th going towards paying the labor. Therefore each successful shipment makes 1/6th profit but each lost shipment is 4x the loss. Worse, a full shipment of Storm Ettarel was hit even though triple the usual mercenaries were with it. This put House Loren into the red as it cost them a full 16000gp. So far, they've been forced to sell the rights to half of their lost shipments for 1/10th their value to house Riegan but have so far kept the rights to the Storm Ettarel. They were offered 1500gp for the rights to the shipment and will have to take it in a month's time to keep the house up.
The spices are usually shipped through Jasperglow and the Giant's pass, most having been found plundered in the Thundering Mountains or the Wolf Woods just past. However, the Storm Ettarel shipment tried a different, experimental, path through the mountains. They went to the east and attempted to push through the mountain to the Ranger's Pass and arrive at Orcwatch tower. The man stationed at Orcwatch never spotted them.
i can copy pasta from rol20
no
yea but it likely wouldnt do that for studded
it wouldnt even be enough to lower your speed by 10
what would studding it with a harder material really do
no shitty leather
get daggers
yea seems good
that is how we make money
we must give these people aids
and whip you
that way parsa cant steal all ur daggers
make 5 daggers
only weapons

Also dming online feels like a 4Head sometimes 
I plan to get us to a point that could be called an ending if nobody wants to take over 
Or they can do whatever they want with it, or make a new campaign
Yea something like that
I'd want to round up my current chapter obviously 
Gonna be a bit of a struggle
At the same time
I'm gonna be working and going to school in like a month
Or can I suggest for somebody else to take over?
So either we can wait for campaign 
Mhm it really is
Yeah, I guess so
And with how much I've been playing fe3h theres no way I wont just turn campaign into that rn
Its gonna diminish the quality of it
Yo guys I'm ngl I dont want to do campaign every week
Very true
OwO sseth
Lemme put these grapes away
Yea I could get some lunch
Okay, cool
I am not alone!

see?
or he'll be a lone wolf
and the old alpha needs to learn comfort in once again being a beta
so younger wolves challenge him for the spot, becoming comfortable as an alpha
the leader gets to old to be comfortable being the alpha
thats why movies are made about wolves and shit
is better than being an uncomfortable alpha
being a comfortable beta
tf

Hmmm well like maybe 3~?
He literally just told us rn

Maybe even later at around 8
Eric if you wanna get dinner we probably wouldnt start until like 7:30 anyways
I get off work at 6:30 and I'll get home around 6:50
Uhh let's just not do it honestly, even though I want to these issues are a little much 
Nono tomorrow wouldbt work itd just be delayed another week till next friday
Not saying you wouldnt participate jett
And I dont necessarily only want two players worth of involvement, but we could

Uhhh so it's looking a little grim
We can still do it tho
Yea I'd have liked that information :)))
Back to work now xd

And it's not like you guys did anything I didnt account for except the circle of truth
It was 20x better when I ran it through my head 
Lance longchad

Tem[b]oral Island: The original tower of magic born into being from an enlightened time from years past. Nobody knows what culture built this building but speculation says it is from around 13,000 years ago. Strong sensations of magic form around it; many mages are often drawn to it for study and enlightenment purposes. It is said to hold a record of the magic used eons ago. 

South Point Rhygal: OwOed owned by lizardmen who are part aquatic/amphibious. These inhabitants of the Rhygal coastline are boat people who sailed here when island hopping. They decided to settle due to its close proximity to their old island home which was destroyed by volcanic activity, seemingly caused by a great impact. Despite not bring originally from the continent, the denizens of Birshance accept them as allies. However, the Fernland and Juniman areas has issues with their proximity in location.

East of that is a Forested fort named Fort Bakal. It is said to be ruled by a General of the orc army who is a half orc named Aknu. He is descended from a legendary warrior god said to have had many different children with many women. His mother was a peasant orc with a lot of world knowledge, just with no time to raise her son and pursue he goals. She taught him everything he knows, and despite his father leaving him before he was even born, he has his incredible genes. He is an immense physical threat, and is not to be taken lightly. He educates all orcs training for the military of Che'Rot.

Further east is the city of Che'Rot. This city is populated mostly by orcs, but it has many people passing through as its a trade city. It is often seen as the most powerful capital in the gestalt empire. Very few people will try and gain citizenship there, as it's often too intimidating for many other races. The society is brutish and unwelcoming to other races settling in and around the city. However, trade is plentiful and the rich own land, not the strong. Many great generals and warriors come here to for a paid training program they teach to outsiders to improve their physical and military training. This town is an oligarchy that is primarily owned by Leon Musk, a great military general that now markets this training for outrageous prices. Boats often stay in the bay of Denwedo for months due to the sheer amount of trade opportunity that consistently arises in the fall.

The area northwest of Che'Rot is the wildlands: untamed fields that stretch for miles said to have many strong and dangerous monsters. It's divided into a western and northern section, with the west side of the division being even wilder.

Northeast of Che'Rot is the Havena Rainforest, and skeleton of Yggdraisal, the world tree. Legend has it that the calamity was unable to harm the forest that surrounds it due to its self sacrifice. Not much is known of the Fey that once lived in the tree, except that there are none now.

The mountains around Che'Rot are populated by dragons and giants who's constant battling makes traversing them nearly impossible. Rock Gnomes once lived in the many caves that are carved into the mountainside before the calamity.

The next capital over is the city of Leane--er, David. King David the 3rd recently renamed the city by the advice of his chancellor to create a recognizable image of his power. David doesn't like to be questioned, but listens to his Chancellor when he needs advice and information. Often parades and fairs are held here to show off the of the success of their farming industry. The city is extremely gentrified, and they take in all the continents criminals to work the plantations. Prisoners oftentimes are forced to overstay their time due to corruption in the more recent government. The city is on the riverbed of the Great snake river.

Beneath the Havena forest is a stretch of marshland that blooms with life, called the Vineyra Marshland. People often take boats through the many small rivers that are hidden underneath the thick canopy of the short parasol trees to explore the ruins.

South of David is the Vigrid Roughland. Many farmers that send their food back to David have their land here as it is fertile and easy to irrigate. The land is quite dusty, but the large amount of groundwater makes farming a temporary economic boom. There was once a great temperate forest here that was cut down to make room for this farmland. This area is mostly populated by humans and the enslaved tieflings that work the land.

Above david is a mostly untamed (mystic) grassland home to many types of wildlife and mystics (an animal like monster that can communicate with humanoids). When david was first constructed it was a multicultural city home to both mystics and humanoids. The dynamic has changed within the last 400 years, when the king at the time expelled all mystics from the city.

The last capital of the gestalt empire is Atoly. Atoly is a multicultural city that connects the Gestalt empire to the eastern Horacion Empire. Atoly is a mixed bag of everything, and its famous for its adventurers guild.

The east is basically just mexic√∂ lol. The Horacian empire is home to the Genasi. There is a hierarchical system based on the type of the genasi. Air &gt; Water &gt; Earth &gt; Fire. Earth genasi are architects and are seen as the middle class. Water genasi live on the coastlines and are very wealthy. Air genasi live above the city and rule over the other types.

The north is a colder climate called Gallassia. Its claimed by the dragonborn as they can survive the cold the best and want to be far away from the less scaley people. They have a cold culture and don't break from the autocratic rule.

Now I must exploit it for all its worth
Shit destroyed me
Oh yea big same on that

I think I'd be okay with it, but I more desire the thought of getting paid for getting mad at league
Yea, and I might even like it too
And hope I dont get swept away
Either that or let it flow like a wild river
Control and funnel it
If I do that, i will make incredible tiktoks
If I do that, i will make incredible tiktoks
It's like aang with the avatar state
I really need to learn how to control my autism

People are legit quindectupoling their lifelong viewership in youtube in 2 weeks
People are legit quindectupoling their lifelong viewership in youtube in 2 weeks
And I know that's not spelled right
Try reactions on tiktok

Might start making retarded tik toks if it fails
See if I can garner any traction
Dabble

I have no space for a desktop
Likely not
I dont really have anything I want to buy
Almost exclusively rent
Rent
HMMM
In terms of the economy afterwards
But it is somewhat worrying 
It's literally the best thing that could've happened to me economically in the short term
It's the best
Yeeee
Bruh I made 6k off unemployment
100 bucks a week
It's not I'd make any money working there
Yea I'm still off

They roast the fk out of em
Hey man if someone's talking shit
So I got powerful allies in chat
Also, almost all my old friends ended up in the top 1% of the game
Its fucking incredible 
Oh yes
And that's part of what makes it great
For the duration
So I just roast them with The Boulder's speech pattern 
But I'm normally down
So many people start to roleplay with me
Yea
But all the regs know I'm a softie xd
Glaring at u
And I got a pic of the character
My ign is TheBoulder
Oh he yea
I told her that her pics were like narcotics or smtg
Shit was hilarious 
Trying to get in good graces
And instead of chat roasting her they all said "Not me! Xd"
She described it as "i bet no homie on sw hasnt tried me lmao"
TONS
LIKE
They get elevated
Theres so many simps on that game
Every channel lowkey has its matriarch
But yea I got back into the social group by talking to the "queen" of 119
And he loves to chat
He was always honest about what he loved
Hey man i guess his interests never wavered 
When he described it to me I realized the magnitude of what he went through 
With no memories
But imagine just waking up in a hospital bed
True lmao
Just woke up and couldn't remember SHIT
But he said he cant remember
Yea I asked him how
Win win
But still said I was chill 
Except one guy named Blank who suffered head trauma
Going back now, almost all of them remember me
But I stopped like 3-4 yrs ago 
I've been talking to people in chat room 119 in sw since like 2014
Summoners war chat has been my life
Summoners war chat has been my life
But lowkey I'm just chillin to get thought this time

Happy thanking

microdosing sounds really helpful
ohhh do you microdose?
and its very good for understanding nature on a deeper level right
and its very good for understanding nature on a deeper level right
good for self reflection
i definitely plan to do it some day
yea i think it could be a fun endeavor
shrooms
that seems like the only real way id do shroom alone
the vision quest is just doing shrooms alone right
wellll
not my style
i wouldnt ever do psychedelics alone
i mean theyre mostly just for fun anyways right
oh
could be a very fun and useful way of reflection
seems like a good call
ive only done them once
but its been a while
they were great the last time i did them
i respect that shit
LMFAO
fk that
so nah
and the more i smoke at night the more i want to smoke in the day
you just dont get anything done if you smoke at the wrong time
it can be a bad habit
its been chill but its something i realized im starting to overdo
its been chill but its something i realized im starting to overdo
so im a little stoned
so i just decided to smoke all my weed and just accept that im out
its been good
and smoked a bowl
i spent my day being a middleman for eric and parsa and then just said fuck it after that
thats not the worst thing, but it definitely couldve been less difficult
er the two of them
did you find it?
that blows
DAMN
I'm nice
Anyways do you like how easily i said everything
And I cant do shit on mobile
No I'm just on mobille
Idk
Btw can you add eric back to the original gestalt learning
Its not hard
See
Just said we both knew that eric is going to continue the old campaign and just found out recently.
But didnt disclose any information
Btw I used your name
Because its mobile 
Sending the screenshots
Watch this
Okay
And he took it well
I told parsa
I'm fucking nice.
Btw I just saved eric and parsas relationship
It was too fucking long
Listen I didnt read that group chat
Obviously
Yes
And he asked to be removed from the campaign
And he asked to be removed from the campaign
His fault imo
Eric has parsa blocked
Before I hit send
Waiting for eric to respond
I'm going in dry
Nah
It's better for him to know now rather than later
I think I'm gonna message parsa about our next plans of action
What's the next move
So miles is down, I'm down, eric is down, and jett will likely be down
Fair lol
And I've grown to like penny 
Especially since your character still has more shit to do
To spare eric further headache
I'd say stick it out with penny
Up to you homie
Holy fucking poggers
Miles said hes down to play Eric's campaign without parsa
Xd
It exhausts me instead
when its just banter its fine
give him the tyler1 treatment
hes toxic he needs to reform
so im down for this its kinda hype
when im just thinking of parsa
like "oh but some people might not get it"
i keep thinking
well if parsa isnt there its fine
itd get there p quick
it might be hard to make it super immersive at first but ithink
and go around the world
to just have fun in
would be a good setting
fair
lets go
cowboy bednd
any spaceships and bounty hunters?
OOOOH
i havent been following
which one is it
that plan is beyond genius
holy fuck
LMFAO
and raid azure peak
i just want to start a holy war
cool
ive been talking to you eric and uti
ive been talking to you eric and uti
i just didnt want to ask
he did mention that you know
but
yes
one sec i got miles on the line
fair
okay
like general rules shit
we do shit to make it better
unless
i think so
the ones that were for shit i didnt care about i didnt read
them
only some of the,
with you me jett miles
the tentative plan ive created with eric is that we start the same campaign
okay so
he couldnt ever get invested
it was aids for him
well i just dont like how jett had to come late
id rather have jett for the whole session
b/c im going to be honest
but i think it was parsa
im neutral on it
or osme shit
and didnt want to fall asleep late
i remember that we started early because parsa wanted to study
b/c jett couldnt ever show up that early
well no it never worked for everyone
i always thought it was tbh
was it because of parsa?
mars why were we doing fridays at 7?
well miles hasnt responded
with no parsa
or continuing erics
yea essentially
but on other things in general about this situation
explicitly 
not on this
gonna ask him his thoughts
aight im doing it im messaging miles
with anyone
aight i dont either
i didnt think you were
eric was just wondering so i asked
rather than harbored
so they can be resolved
i like to know if he knows my opinions/thoughts
lmk if you say anything then
i dont mind i just want to know b/c eric isnt talking to him rn
right as we were talking about this
eric said he got a ton of messages from parsa
are you messaging parsa at all
mars
and always did things alone
talked to every noble for us
at all
which he wasnt
was an unlucky situation because he just gets to be toxic online
that shit essentially muted me, and i was still struggling to figure out how to play my character
it wasnt there
like i said, never got to read it
i assumed his backstory was just that he was a theatre asshole
and just a nexus for parsa to be an asshole
ie the character was shit
not longer than a few sentences
he didnt write one
eric said noxalas didnt have a backstory
it was always hidden
its not like i got to read his backstory anyways
the backstory doesnt matter, what matters is how the character showed himself during sessions
any character thats an enabler for that behavior isnt helpful imo
he was a bad character that allowed his played to just be an asshole
imo other way around
he was a problem
yes but because of that
bards are supposed to be inspiring but noxalas had the tone of a warlock
rather than words that lifted others up
and he chose words that put other down
noxalas was a bard who specialized in using big words often
and it made me just shut up
he used his characters backstory to openly flame my character constantly
yes and no
i think this is a fair call
tell me how im wrong if i am
which was lowkey the point of the whole campaign
at least, for noble interactions and shit
everything was done on his call
when noxalas was around
nono
i get it now
my b
so it drove it to the ground
so parsa took control of the campaign
so i have nobody in power to feed my ideas to
but then jett isnt here
but i chose to take a submissive role for a female bishop who isnt the main character
and it was usually my first instinct
i was allowed to just say shit
well thats why it worked when i was the party lead
damb
except when i know im right
b/c this whole time ive just thought i was wrong b/c nobody agrees with me
that you dont even catch the details he puts down
so are you saying
b/c im not trying to box in online dnd
i just think theyre right
but because everyone else says shit loudly
okay this may sounds dumb
wait srsly?
except when eric goes through with them
until they die
until they die
when i do have ideas though parsa just flames them
so i just go along with them
well tbh sometimes i just dont have ideas as quickly as others
had a lot of pendings with uti too
skype has big autism recently
ahhh
what
the word kinda spread like wildfire around the store
if its less than 6 ill get you in for sure
lmfao ill consider it, i need to figure out how many people im playing with already
easily like an hour plus commute
and most people dont live by the store
b/c everyone comes in for hours at different times
but everyones schedules are always gonna clash
i wish i could
ehhhhhhhh
same
and create a meme fiesta
with new players
so i might just get my dm fix there
i was talking to some coworkers about running a uniqlo staff campaign
b/c in the midst of all this
i might not do it at all tohugh
fix your shit if you want in homie
find someone else and say he was the chopping block too toxic for the new guy
i think thats the best play
yea unless i replace him for being toxic
i wish that wasnt true
didnt we learn this from this experience?
i just dont know if i should have to say that
that fair tho
xd
whether im dm or another pc
whether im dm or another pc
b/c ive always had issues with him as a player
i meant that i wanted to do it without parsa
when i said i wanted to run a campaign
tbh though
LFMAOAOOOO
everyone deserves a shot
me too i want to give him one shot
and make life anew
rise from the ashes bitches
b/c im a phoenix 
more than ever
all this shit makes me want to run a campaign
and yknow what the best part is
oh yea dude i know
dang
wait who said that
cool
and it didnt create all this chaos
thats what i did last time
w/o drama
for your actions and just leave
just take responsibility

dont hold it over our heads though
i told him to just do that
^
he didnt want to risk more randos
he didnt
he essentially destroyed it
and now theres no campaign at all
so we ended up just talking more and more and more
but the issue was that he didnt leave the call after that
and he did leave
i was like okay then just leave
and threatened to leave if it didnt change
he essentially tried to guilt trip eric into changing
yes
2 days ago
it was like
no i meant all this drama
and then threatened to leave
and ended up just laying into eric and flaming him the whole call
eric and i
he joined a call supposedly to play terraria with
where he flamed me
besides the group chat discussion
of all this pissy shit
well do you know the origin
so i was like okay w/e i wont lead again
and parsa got pissy at that, to me individually actually
i didnt want to do it again because i was the lead last time
he was
yes
as a joke
unless they fuck up and i can flame them
its just strange to be rude to someone for me
i know he is though
eyyyy
so ive always been weary
he was legit hurt by it
showed me he wasnt that thick skinned
okay but that ruben shit
hol up foods here
i need to learn to enjoy flaming him
flip
and i dont like that coinfli
you're a chump or a badass
if you dont follow the rules
and it makes you feel like the scum of the earth
when you say that
he gets a really nasty tone
but since he can be a bitch about that
okay you're right
at least for me it did
and that can just cause confusion
you feel like you need to change what you're doing
well the thing is that since hes right
big pog
hol up uti messaged back
DEADASS
and having him chastise you over the rules can be aids at time
5e has a lot of complicated bs to remember
and thats not only boring, its confusing
but doesnt like to play the game he likes to play the meta
he knows so much about the rules
parsa is a shit tier player
its not easy but you're right
that you're right
so i know that when you're saying this
ive been there myself for numerous sessions and i understand his plight
well its confusing when you're in the dm seat
im the morale support
we talked about how everyone was bitching art him
aight ill just wait for a response
is he on skype
but forgot to
to catch up
i was gonna msg him last night
YKNOW
oh right
but pls do tell me whats up
still going to be doing that
sorry was practicing bass
a i g h t
aight
gnight
the ultimate cancer
fk amazon but i like amazons service
aight then
and burning
eyes are red
im fuckin tired
im gonna get some bed
idfk
do the employees even add the items?
but once its there isnt it just bugfixing and adding more items?
actually i can sorta see it
sure its massive
to run an online store
why do you need so much ai
xD!
b/c they make a ton of money and dont pay taxes
you get to make a ton of money
which will likely lead to a monopoly
unless theyre planning on further expansion
so many more IT people
i dont actually get how amazon needs to be hiring
upper management i never had respect for in any company that pays zero in taxes
and you can be forgiven
like if you're a delivery guy its probably not entirely by choice
at amazon
it depends on where you're working
you might be onto something
i never thought about it
hm
and trying is better than the us government
but at least they try
they may not fix it
we need riot games
need a rework
probably most of it to mr besos
which almost entirely goes to a select few at the top
11 fucking billion
after making 11billion in profits in 2018
amazon is still paying zero dollars in taxes
and guess what
wtf was wrong with you
if bill was desperate enough to fuck the fat secretary 
hillary we dont feel sorry for you
and she though people still liked her
national disgrace for her
whitehouse
the
in
even bill wasnt having it
^^^^
likely true
F
could be
its all appearances huh
a really good reason
thats actually
maybe lol
and fix corporate tax issues
just make the tax rates fair and you dont need that right?
for paying taxes at all
like why do you get money back
i just think the system overall is stupid
yea its a good system if you're trying to spend the time to do it
whenever i see her do taxes its like a 7 day process
my mom is freelance though
like all of my taxes are already accounted for
its really easy to do 
gotta ride those waves
gotta ride those waves
while theyre there
b/c then i get a sudden burst of income
maybe its good actually
and we just had a better system
lowkey wish that i didnt have to file taxes
i get some though which is decent
gotcha
ive never filed taxes before
oh
but those ones you listed are on my paycheck
they have more taxes that i dont know about maybe
i see it every two weeks
it comes out of our paycheck tho
or go full time
so i have to game it
its a dumb system
to make up for it
b/c they just dont give us shifts
well no they arent
even though i like most of the people i work with
imho
and we have just about that many disposable heads
honestly
15 people
we need to fire like
that things cant ever be stable
and the income our store makes changes so drastically
so enough people change their schedule regularly 
but we have too many people
i wish they did that shit man
i dont have it next week
all i know is that if i call out a shift
wish i knew
is huge
and getting him to like/respect you
is op if you dont have a stable work situation
knowing the boss
and try to rng my way to getting a decent shift
and i dont have to use the group chat
but the homie kyle is hooking me up
no extra pay
dude im hungry for shifts rn
so whenever i get the text
my schedule is on call rn
also i need to make my character for parsas thing
otherwise id stay up for that conversation
i wanna know what you said to eric about dnd tmrw
okay im too tired
a g r e e d
unless everyone or enough people agree it shouldnt be there
how else do you get a mountain moved
it moves mountains
agreement is a powerful tool
that we both already knew
which is the important take away
but not respected
its funny enough to be valuable
yea
tired xd
im not saying hes a chad
im just thinking of the name
skylar
no hes not there yet
i guess?
but the frat fuck is chad
johnny is either a degenerate or a frat fuck
forgot
oh yea and the frat guy
whos in a frat
and 3 black people particularly from the inner city
2. johhny mcfuckboi white guy who skates or smokes too much
the only people who i see wear supreme are 1( Chinese men no older than 30
yes, me too
the original hypebeasts
thats how it is in asia too im pretty sure
whatsoever
otherwise i dont see the appeal
"look i wear supreme too we must be the same type of idiot xd"
yea that shits just free advertising b/c people think itll help them get accepted
is it respected? or is it a very different and individual opinion for each person?
what do they think?
like when a person who works in fashion sees a gucci jacket or some shit
idk how they do though its always been a bit of a mystery to me
so people within that world are gonna see things differently
its a job market
fashion is its own world
so dumb
to the brand
theres an applicable reason
exactly lol
hypebeast culture
or w/e
its a plain tshirt with no benefits that just promotes skate culture
but this shit isnt that
then just get it idc its meant for skating
and the one downside is that it has a logo on it
if the clothing is cheap but does well for skating
look i think i can only go so far on hating these guys
oh
but this isnt that
but this isnt that
if it was cheap and tailored to a certain demographic for applicable reasons
the price kills it
but most of the time people just buy shit that makes them look stupid
but most of the time people just buy shit that makes them look stupid
and for some it works
the whole movement is just to socialize pathetic hypebeasts so they feel like their artificial connections can get them real friends 
yea its aids
supreme xd
yea for sure
i dont like displaying that information and giving free advertising
i think its tacky, but also i dont like people knowing where i shop
Yup.
i only own 3 graphic ts
yea same
etc
graphic t
polka dot
flannel
i didnt own a single striped shirt
id only wear plain clothes
when i was young
FAIR
but my mom does have rlly good style
i dont know if thats true for you
b/c she has better style than me
same here but i learned to not do that as much
she knows how to drag it out
she was a professional clothing stylist for 6 years
jett and i at the same time
shed spend actually forever trying to find clothes that looked good on us
well the issue for me wouldnt be that shed take forever for herself
well the issue for me wouldnt be that shed take forever for herself
to go shopping for a single day
to go shopping for a single day
holy fuck itd legit take 8 hours
MY MOM
DUDE
or sweater
and tjmax ends up being christmas shopping where i find a nice jacket
except uniqlo and tjmax
i havent gone to another clothing store in years
i only do it because i work there
same lol
but they have a good feel and fit
plain
fair
just not insane
now theyre 8 but still a good deal
for a brand new well fitting t
these shirts used to be 6 bucks
i also like our packaged tshirts
after tax after discount
no its 38
34 length
size 31 waist
long n thin
yee
especially after the discount
so these things are a blessing
my body style is hard to fit
best price i can find for skinny jeans that fit me
hell yea
its like new york
the japanese umbrella thing is sick
one of them is shitty
except one
50 bucks each and theyre all worth it
legit own like 5 pairs of the jeans
i think the best item in the store are the jeans i buy
but it looks like it should be
ours isnt
aside from looking japanese
idk what the point of buying it is
its lowkey not even waterproof
or some shit
38th in the world
richest man in japan
owner of uniqlo
yea
so ty mr yunai
to shop where you work
its the only way you can afford
30% off
some things are really well priced
its a hard 50/50 on prices
because it was too expensive
then didnt buy it
after angel tried on his new fit
he just dipped 2 minutes later
nah
end
so i just laughed
was lowkey funny
he just screams that shit
one is named angel
hes with two black guys
then he says "cmon my nigga angel needs a new fit"
i say nah i wish homie
then he says "you got a discount for friends?
if you need any help let me know
i say hey wassup you're kareem right
i dont bother correcting him
he recognizes me and goes "wassup miles"
idk if he last name is actually abdul but thats how i remember it
this ginger guy kareem abdul who i knew from high school came into my store 
this ginger guy kareem abdul who i knew from high school came into my store 
from work
i have a decent story
uh
but i also just wanted to say hi xd
and he said you had good points
so i was talking with eric about dnd
same
if u want
just talk like idiot
im tired but i will talk
vro
we'll talk later
we'll talk later
gotcha
even though you just got off
you can join if you want ig
so now may not be the best time
im about to get in a league game w/ digbo and gwyn
you free to talk at any point tonight?
yo
He does want to create a good plan, just one that he sees as good and will flame us constantly if he thinks our plan isnt sound or if its immoral or if it's fun or if its creative or if it has any inkling of a chance of failure
Or if you disagree with what I've said
Maybe, like I said before, parsas over inflated ego is the issue. He cares too much about actually having his ideal game and harbors too many low opinions of his fellow players, so this leads to a bunch of autism from his end. This then leads to him nothing understanding what is okay to say or not. So, he decides to pick some of the worst possible things to say for constructive social conversation. He feels justified in saying this because he sees us all as stupid, or at least our ideas as stupid (but I think it's just us). He feels justified in his flaming as well because he knows we wont get TOO mad at him for acting like a bitch. That's likely why he doesnt flame in Kevin's campaign, hes afraid of looking like a dick around people he doesnt know extremely well in person. This was the problem in rubens campaign back in the day too, but I was too used to his toxicity to be able to tell him why they didnt like him. Honestly though, it was just because he didnt like everyone else for getting high while playing that led to him believing he was mentally superior to everyone else. This shit is kind of a constant, and it's pretty toxic to deal with. Not sure what the solution is, shoot if you have any ideas.
You said it's not like this in the other one
You said it's not like this in the other one
Why does he flex his ego so much in this campaign
Am I missing something? Am I confused?
Right?
Or he just didnt care
Or he just didnt care
Dude it's because he either didnt understand what we wanted
Dude it's because he either didnt understand what we wanted
Otherwise why would you NOT try shit?
I think hes afraid of failure or something
And expects us just to drop our plan
Well he sees our plan as stupid, says no, then doesnt give us a better one
Either that or hes just being a dick for his own satisfaction 
Has an ego
He genuinely
Dude the tone of that conversation was so volatile 
When I start I'll let you know tho
Been thinking about it but havent gotten the chance yet
not optimal but at least im working
just for more hours
i scheduled myself for a 7am tmrw
idk otherwise its a solid position because hey at least you dont have to walk everywhere all the time
but im sure itll get bad for your health or some shit
being in front of a computer is kinda nice
not the worst thing honestly, its a good job
thatd be sick to get to
oh shit thats a step up
2nd job? or what
ooh where are you thinking of applying?
you?
worked 3 days in a row, was gonna work tonight but was too tired to ask for a shift
been working a lot
the weeks been good, i had this college interview shit this morning at 630 am that exhausted me
xd
finally teaching me something, its nice
hes been pushing me in that direction
ever since jett came here this summer i guess 
and just accept if im wrong
but i try and go with a good outlook
same tbh
LUL
its been a good pitch tho im sold
im just high and overthinking shit retardedly
gotchu gotchu
but im super down tmrw
ngl i just smoked a bowl so im not trying to read it right now
amazing
oh god so theres more to look forward to
ohhh i see, how long was it going on for?
thanks for linking me up
aight perfect
since i have a day off most likely
well just send it to me and i start it tmrw
and it sounds interesting to try and get into new genres
i dont, it gives me something to do when i drift back to my computer
or a comic series
so is it a book series
LUL
okay i see how thats interesting 
gotcha
hmm okay, so its a breakdown of the genre not an actual story from the genre
okay whats worm about
why wassup?
uh actually im lowkey neutral, but im with the jokes and i really liked into the spiderverse
que
thats when shit starts moving
honestly
thats what growing as a party is
not have unnecessary walls between us
itll be nice to work together finally
yup
i agree with this too though
but i meant in the group call
elf fucker kinda nice
time to fuck her
time to fuck her
shes an elf?
of course
we must rise up
this is oppression 
ive been silenced on too many occasions
xd
why not live a little
then be a fucking snake
bait them into thinking im nice
i love doing the bait and swap
xd
In a sea of hoes she stays loyal 
Shes worth it 
Yuh but I got a light meal and cat food for sc
Only reason I considered it
The panini gets me a free drink
Aight I'm with it
To fuel my conversational drive
Or bean and cheese burrito
Do I get a panini
Now I just need to make the most of it
Insane lol
It's a sign
In 20 minutes
Were going to the beach
Wow
Omg hes calling rn
That's what I often do when we see each other
And just get to talk with him if hes free idk
?*
Hey wanna hang out,m
Be the one to make the first move
I should text my dad maybe
About to walk to the store, actually
Thats why the beach is optimal, its away from the city
Just got tons of shit to distract me here
Yup
Hahaha
Also not a bad idea, but I'm lowkey sunburned 
Not a bad idea honestly 
I have satisfaction already
I need to focus on my career
But truthfully, those dont make me money
Gotta do it quickly dont wanna be doing nothing for too long
That isnt playing video games
Now I'm just trying to find shit to do
Which is why it was so nice to hang
Really helps just getting another's input 
I just got done talking with Jimmy about some of the subjects we went on about, and itll be nice to keep on reflecting with the help of others
Completely get it
Itll happen tho
I thought we maybe go to beach today...but it was not meant to be...
Vro was gud to hang 
my dino suit
yea im wearing my suit
Its wednesday aka tmrw
Okay not bowling on thursday

i was the first to admit it
i remember nnn
that you did read that book
yea i remember now
yea its doomed
oh
on character design
theyre pretty clear cut
i dont think books are very gay yet
nerd\
if its scuffed lore
does parsa like dark heresy then
well shit maybe its happening
hm ok
and too weird
too small of a community
its not gonna reach there outside of a few select cases
yuuuup
daily
i see it on twitter
yup
times are a changin'
thats how i know
but enough to include gay relationships in FE
well not lots a lots
lots of gay nerds nowadays
although hed probably have more success if he were gay
but i cant blame his parents
by psychological abuse
hes been forced to be straight
hes deathly afraid of offending nasrin
parsa cant be gay
i didnt believe it
we werent wrong
but like goddamn
eric and gwyn both brought it up
"we know statistically one of us is gay"
for years
we talked about the stats
these are just rlly modern manners
thats called manners
true
its a bad thought
yea its a bad

Ha!
Offer?
What do you recommend?
you must assault the titty from above
suckle like child
baby man
at heart
i feel like im the bottom one
which one r u
fk a bitch named hill-dog
and aids
the trap hillary has is likely riddled with poisons
id take those odds in a heartbeat
very true
oof 
i hate
emotionally
if she was human
xd
lizard
no she wouldve had to had acted like a human being
and we need a woman xD!!!
that nobody could fk with her unless they bought into the fact that shes a wooman
but she just so corrupt ugly and had such a shit laugh
she shouldve won
is because she was the definition of unlikable 
well the only reason hillary lost
still salty about the dnc
xd
bernie beat trump
ALSO
very true statement
-bill burr
she dresses like a yak 
yea
unwinnable*
 sorry not rigged
tbf
nah bernie ceded b/c rigged
which somehow translated into EVERYONE
it was just a bunch of extremists that gave that impression about her supporters
well either way ive decided the populous didnt even like her because she was a woman
you have to be so unlikable 
it takes skill to be that bad
its crazy man she lost to an orangutan
xd
than a fact
so its more of a dogma
well she didnt win
shes blue
i rlly dont like her but she actually has one single quality
a sin in itself*
a sin itself
it birthed chelsea clinton
at her age bracket
no thats no longer a redeeming quality
and all her fans are psychotic
she has no redeeming qualities
on the globe
hillary clinton is my least fav person
xd
yea man if only i voted bernie
tuck frump
b/c i thought of that
nah i checked age
didnt wanna do the research
idek if it was trump ill just blame him
i only get half now
trump did some shit last year or smth
very gay
since trump
half as op as last patch
yea theyre kinda weak now
so its fine
and theyre free
eventual real college
and they count towards like
its not like theyre super taxing
but i might as well take GE's on the side
i need to find out what im doing still i guess
but i stick with shit yknow
rlly dont like school
gonna be rough
Yup
dont learn anything and get depressed by being in school
b/c smc isnt proud to be
gotta speed it up
just slowed it down for a while
start again tmrw
yea
aight
how old is she btw
thats unlucky
oh
ofc
in a single
yea
its gonna be rough
like if its you and your sister + anyone
no matter who it is
i can imagine a single like that getting bad
id want to avoid that\
yea LOL
None at all
i'll letcha know tho
yeeee
gotcha
yea lol
you already knew that LMAO
idk why i brought it up
in a funyn way
say dumb shit
but im just even more autistic
like im the same guy
ig
and living w/ me
theres a difference between seeing me
we got another issue
if she can be attracted to a white autist
ahhh i see
w o a h 
like decent manners? 
wow!
i'll talk w/ her about it tho id be down
but to be fair i dont think she can move rn
b/c id obviously not move and just leave her w/o a good situation
itd all be about whether or not my mom can move
HMMMMMM
yo
Almost identical, unfortunately
Very similar story to the church route
It was decent
Jett just finished it this morning 
i had double stride and it was totally worth it
stride is fucking nuts
Unless you know the gimmicks
And then suddenly its bs in the last couple
They lowkey get harder 
It's like a mix of Hubert and sylvain without any of the brain
It's like a mix of Hubert and sylvain without any of the brain
I did yea it's so hard to watch
Also Lorenz is a bitch I agree
It could've been so much more flushed out tho
But it's cool that they get revealed as fucked up
I agree honestly it makes for a much better story
Well then I respect that
Bitcho grando
And fuck seteth too
Fuck you flayn
Tru
Yea and it has a good amount of range 
Yes
Yes
But fortify is solid
True
Or flayn
Yea linhardt becomes a beast with it
Or whatever
Because hes ferdanand von eire
With his confidence passive
It's so solid for him
Yea lmfao
It's just really solid
One more mt and more crit than the silver lance
Eff vs cavalry
Heals 10 hp every round he holds it
And its anti cavalry
Which is still really solid
He has spear of assal
He had more spd
Yea just a little
Ofc
Except byleth
He was lowkey my strongest unit
Dude my Ferdinand was godlike
Until like the halfway point
Hes 1v9
Nah it's just not possible
Oh...
You said Ferdinand right
Yea
Waiting for lunatic
But its not impossible or anything
Especially in the church route 
Dude it gets harder
It wouldnt let me down
I believe in it
Becuase you only have like 3 units
Play on expert mode
LMAO
I need to do another insane galeforce run soon
Xd
Nothing had the slightest chance of touching chrom
They just went in and anything died
It was still crazy to watch
Even tho it wasnt exactly a dark flier setup
Constantly
Legit 1v9d
My lucina frobin mix was amazing 
You just have two broken ass units
And you set it up properly 
Yea its fucking nuts when that shit works too
Very very true 
Mhm
Owain was sick too
But Morgan noire was insane
Xd
I miss my anna lucina man
It's like a better shadows of valentia which I never even played
Mhm
Tons of content
But 3h is great as a standard fire emblem
It's such a fun child building experience 
Same I was do it soon
Insane skill
So good
Aptitude was it?
Ur
LMAO it not wrong 
Not back then
But I didnt know that lol
Also true
I liked him better
My first playthrough was mrobin
No 
She was solid 
I used cherche
The backup exactly 
Yes lol
What a solid unit
I loved Morgan man
Tyty
GEROME^^^
Geralt?
Frederick is awakening
Fates conquest
Fatea
That's fatea
I dumped the vaike I immediately 
Me either 
They sucked dick because what kind of axe user has a magic stat
Yea lol
You only got like one
They just werent used
Even in awakening 
They were always a thing 
Yea lol
And bolt axes but those are later
Arcane crystals are for levins only tbh
To get it back
I just dumped all my umbral steel on it
Yea me either
I'm sure it could work
If you go swords and mage
Otherwise it's way better
Yea ur not wrong except my magic stat is kinda shit
And it was
Because I had a feeling the sword of the creator would be bullshit
And just 1v9d shit
Went for a sword master build
Mhm
Yea I did that with my byleth 
Except with items I guess
Tho
You cant max out spd
Ahh fuck now I'm happy I'm doing blue lions soon
Yeaa
Ahhh that's really sad
Oh what did you do lol
It was worth it imo
I'm 200 iq
Yeah
Yea
Where the story diverges
Because it was at the edlegard flame emperor reveal
Well I guess the second run didnt really have a chance
Without doing that man
I just completed two runs
Ill get everyone I want
Okay next run
Ahhhhhh
Fuck me I got baited
Gotcha I didn't know if that did anything
Wow okay that makes sense now
Fuck me
Ahh I was min maxing too hard
I should've just spam gave them gifts
I really wanted Mercedes and Ingrid 
I neeeded some people
What the fuck I messed up
Oh god
OH
I didn't know that was a fucking option
Damb
No way that's so fucked
WHAT
Wait what?
Like dark spikes is fucked
She seems kinda strong
Dorothea got this
The ez dance champion
Oh yea man
What
Its rlly easy
Exactly 
He does so much dmg rn
Smacks everything
And claude a beast but Raphael is the champion 
The characters are all really likeable tbh
He loves them
If not that could be cool
I'll let you know q little when jett gets there if you want to
Idk I havent done them yet
Hmm
It's just a shamw
If it doesnt tho that's fine too
I think it could happen but I'm not entirely sure
Yea 
Like you being a blue lion means something n shit
And let's you do the same two routes thing
I think there might be another alternate storyline that your house experiences as conflict
Well that's not what I mean
Or like 4 and a half technically 
If they do its potentially 6 routes
Idk yet
Crazy that theres actually two routes right
I just finished my secondary route tho, where I didnt betray the church 
Betraying the church with her is what I did too
YUP
Hes really strong honestly might not be a bad pickup
Dude lorenz is kind of a unit
Sorry, been watching jetts first run!
Wait woah what happened
Damn youre right
Damn youre right
The balance of power is shifting
Time to tip the scales my man
Xd
And parsa the rule dictator is there who will correct you passively aggressively judge you if you do it wrong
Because you're the one who's supposed to enforce them
Especially for the dm
Becuase theres a lot of dnd rules that make the game less fun
Well either way that's just one of some things I'd need to change about the rules
And in cities youd need disguise self or full armor normally
Because the dungeon tends to be one class of enemy
But i feel like that's exactly what all stealth missions turn into when dungeoning anyways
Yea lol
Well you can its dnd
They can look different but theres objectively no way to feel superior because you're all the same
They can look different but theres objectively no way to feel superior because you're all the same
Nah no need
Vs wild fucking savage shit
Which all share the same goal with minor sub cultural differences
Like you guys can be part of the alliance races 
At most
I'd have to do a us vs them setting
It's too much
Like fk that
Each with their own cultures 
13 fucking races inplemenented
Like when you're expected to have like
Another issue with dnd is scope
But now I understand it
It didn't seem that bad at first ngl
That's muy difficil
Now that I think about it
Ohh yea
I think if you did a setting where we visit planet zebes or something
I think if you did a setting where we visit planet zebes or something
It could happen
I liked the idea of the space jam
I liked the idea of the space jam
It seemed hard tho
Fair
But if I were to ever do another campaign, I'd have to do a setting thats super easy for me
Which is the bigger issue
Or it would lower the quality of the campaign more of less
And thatll just be boring for me?
^
Online is legit meant for planned stories 
Because I dont like to plan a defined story
Since I'm already thinking so heavily about what I'm even doing
My inflection and hinting is totally lost over the mic becuase I cant look at players when talking to them
But it's really because its online 
Yea but even for you it's hard with Eric and parsa 
Miles
Mike's doesnt want to introduce new things
Yup
They just start complaining 
Yea but with eric and parsa its hard
I know it can and I want it to
Just a little 
Another issue is that I put the hands of fate too heavily in the the players imho
HM okay
And my own limited creativity unless sits planned out
Also I dont describe things well enough but that's just due to it being online
Yea, additionally because of that, I wasnt able to put a story into the campaign after the first 3 sessions
I wasnt thinking about what kind of story would make it interesting for me, as a dm
I deadass realized what I was doing wrong with my campaigns
Nerdier than it has to be*
I listened to what jett had to say about it and it seems like the module was a little constricting and honestly nerdy
It's the only way I'd be super interested
I'm down to go to an in person one
When is it
Its okk
What part are you at btw
Sorry had ruben over didnt see this
Ah dang I think it might scuffed yea
Itll be hard to raise supports if you get those students late
unless you imagine her as a Tennessee girl
idk why else you'd want doro on a horse
i think ur good
they got married on accident in my run
and they both get riding maxed quickly
just put ferdinand and sylvain in the stables every week
its broken insane class
it felt optimal
both cavaliers and then paladins
but it was maybe b/c of the items
but i honestly think he scales better and worse
well thats true
hes a nutcase
oh yea
oh yea
and he caught up really easily
but i leveled ferdinand afterwards 
i did the same thing
my fav units were prepatch edelgard, hubert, petra, sylvain, and felix strictly as a combat unit
lets go ferdinand
instead of an ego
with straight delusion
just a way more polite version of jett
am i wrong
just way overdone
bro ferdinand reminds me of jett
oh nice
i have a bit-
fair i dont have a sister
ah
it just felt like anime shit
she looks young and is super well spoken
but i didnt think she was cute rlly
you're fiending
okay if you're fiending
hated her from second zero
fuck flayn
flayn is deadweight
edelgard old form is great
cant stop wont stop
respect the grind
lets go sylvain
so good
it makes sense now
i didnt get why he joined
OHHH
he doesnt even try to stay in his house
sylvain is a defector 
let jett do the deer
i think
i wanna do a blue lions run
shit guy
hes just meant to be bad
wait he had no crest?
i had to do that with [b]etra
you might have to force feed him
yea lol
sacked him
shit unit
LUL
in my next run
ill try to recruit him
yknow what
no he didnt get to hit anything but once
i didnt get to use him
dude its a 180
80% hit chance
he had no chance
he didnt win
he turns into chads[b]ar 
and said "if you win you're saved"
let him 1v3 archers
fucked him early
yea
cas{b]ar
thats lame
and left the chatroom
chauster died
chauster wasnt
oh is hubert still there?
and a genius
hes the right hand man
yea lol
trust
and shit
also he has a ton of useful info
same
low dodge rate
hes just hard to get hits with sometimes
nah hubert is strong af late game
she came in clutch
[b]etra
nice i did the same for my girl
he was a true mans man
wtf
but no why hubert
its actually decent
well i told you
Nah I'm good b
But that might change
Stat wise more so than personality from what I can tell
And tons of character development time
Definitely theres a ton of content in this game
I'm 30 hours in and I just got over the first major plot twist
But that's only because the game is so fucking long
Except in very specific circumstances
Because it feels like you can predict how they'll say lines 
Which is a little eh after a while
None of the characters ever change pitch or delivery
And the va is really good but like
ALSO the whole game is voice acted
Fates*
Because after gates I lost hope
Which is really good and almost impressive
But nah the game is good without it
But the story is already kinda confusing at the part I'm at and I'm not sure if forcing a time travel element into it wouldve been a good idea
Yea I guess when you put time into effect it works too
Itd be fucked
I dont want to see all my students getting pregnant 
But this is a school setting
I loved it man
Which I fuck with
Combat feels a lot more fair on classic mode tho 
And they removed time babies which is probably for the better even though I liked them
BUT it's all really fun
More so than previous titles
The characters can start to seem one dimensional after like 30 hours of gameplay 
Unfortunately theres enough weeb shit you have to plow through that is honestly just had at times 
I was worried about it being boring but it works really well in the fe style
The whole professor thing is actually pretty solid 
At least it makes you feel that way
But that's probably due to the fact that om a bomb ass professor that levels my students really well
The combat is definitely on the easy side even on hard classic, which is the hardest difficulty possible
The characters are all pretty solid and the story is entertaining 
When you start playing it you really dont wanna put it down
Ok so fe3h has a super addictive playstyle
I'll tell you more gimme 1 sec
No it wont suck it's really good
But 100x better than fates
Just below it
No not imo
So far
8-8.5
But black eagles are still great def dont have any regrets
I started to realize half my favorite units were in the blue lions
And failing to recruit a ton of the students that I wanted to
After playing through a lot of the game
But they're all good from what I can tell 
I chose black eagles
Aight I'll bring some
You got enough tho
I can bring them just wondering 
Do you have papers tho
Perfect
Not gonna deprive him
And jetts gonna want it
Lighter
Im
But in bringing weed
I only have the one
For utis house
Vro you got a light?
big fan
yea i like it
ill get 16 soon after my eval
15'5
Its poppin
Sweet that's good to hear
Unless I pick up a shift
Which is what I work rn
Okay let's say like 32 hrs a week
Not to pry or anythi g but what's the standard 2 week pay at your bar
I'd be a solid ass bartender eventually too
If we do the apartment thing and the job at the bar is better than uniqlo I'm super down
Hell yea
Understood vro were gonna miss you
Parsa said you probably cant make it
Parsa said you probably cant make it

imma be hyped
mine is may 26th
nah his bday is sep 5th
but they aint like that
technically they could say "ur 18 kid" and take it
yea
but hes a sleuth 
my dad acts like the most aloof fool
i think my dad picked up on that
remember how jett said he bought an ounce to sell
10/10
and my dad was like "never get high on ur own supply"
my mom was like "let me try ur shit"
instead of being mad at jett or even being weird about it
and now theyre all having a stoner conversation in the other room
so my mom came home and smelled that shit
and they smoked a ton right
and my dad was out at his storage
when my mom and i were at the ralley
also jetts home right so he had some friends over
yup
did it with eric and uti only tho
i love doing that shit with friends
yes it is
yes
also no it was fully censored
that website has fucking everything man
on P O R N H U B 
guess where we watched it
it was so obviously bad
it was fucking hilarious
at like 1 am on my floor
we watched the nekopara OVA
over winter
like
b/c when he came over
we're both weebs
i remember uti is a weeb
OH
thats very very very gay
Idk much about fma
Or is there not a distinction 
Ok
Or*
For just fma in general
In particular brotherhood?
Good is good
I think that's aight with me
so its okay
yea but im very gay when i watch shit alone with headphones
okok
with your approval 
id watch it
is it rlly that good
tenn told me about little witch academia
okay so
my dnd fighter that lasted like 2 sessions
you remember mujin fuu
champloo is godlike
OD
THATS
YUP
b/c i adore ryuko
i genuinely loved klk
so i like to make it a problem
im a kill la kill fan tho
iirc
and he loves berserk
IK
b/c you have that veil of mystery around you
both of you dont get called weebs
like miles
mars you're a mysterious man
so i just admit it
they just say "oh but that makes you a weeb LMAOOOOO"
but with the degenerates we talk to
thats what i used to say
so i just say im a weeb
aka fuck
so i both lie to myself and dont
but i am at the same time
look im not a weeb but its easier to say i am
he wants to be a weeb so bad
HE WANTS TO BE
a wilding goon
hes a goon
but i love him
never says shit
NOPE
private school right
ohhh
didnt think so
or if hes coming back for spring
btw do you know when uti comes back
cool
or thursday
i can do saturday
we'll hang sometime
okay cool
but i understand
i want hang
and i was asking b/c i knew you had dnd
that you were
jett just told me
yea lol
yea it aint happening
hmm its dnd night
it milo
i just got home from the bernie rally
you want hang
mars vro
FLIPS A GOAT
shes fucking suplexing everything in sight
lets go mio
and i love it
that character is a fucking retard
holy fucking shit that was hilarious
lemme see this clip
yea i gotcha
i must watch it
??
very excellente
like an old person
i start screaming lmao
my pea brain cant keep quiet
ive noticed that when i have headphones on
tbh
b/c im lazy
but i rarely use headphones
not that time
"turn that shit off"
"what the fuck are you doing milo"
and my mom was like
i had it on speakers
it couldnt play against it
i had to mute my hollow knight to beat hornet
if so, thats gonna suck
it looks great but im still weary of whether or not hornets stupid ass SHAA voice lines will happen after every attack
yea i saw the trailer
just programmed to be one
androids cant actually be thots
yeee
on top of being thicc
bayo is a fucking thot
well, would be
i will be the best 2b in the world
and im with it
gimme 2b as a playable character
is that i want a nier rep in smash
man all that ive realized now by playing through ending c
b/c it lets you go back
its essentially a game over
its p troll
yea
LMAO
okay then
huh
yea i expected that 
instead of sparing him
im assuming theres one where you choose to kill pascal
apparently theres an "ending" for every level of the alphabet right
yea
yea thats what i thought it was
ok
i'll do it soon so i'll tell you if its hype
huh
ok gotcha
or is it completely different
is route d where you choose 9s
a2 is sick
yea
did the fight with edgy 9s
yea
and the tower being destroyed
it ended with a2 falling down the tower
no i dont think so
hm?
definitely wanna see the rest of the story
very cool route
yea right i forgot about that for a sec
shes just a killer
yea
i didnt really get that 100%
or a2?
?
i assume that means that her mission was to destroy 9s&gt;
which meant that she was made to eliminate other androids or smth
and that she was a 2e
there was this one part where a2 said that 2b wasnt actually a 2b model
yea for sure
and way less annoying than i thought it was originally
definitely fun though
i couldnt control whether the mouse slid or not
especially since i had to switch my whole hand placement to even do it
which was fucking cancer
and i wouldnt be able to turn with the arrow keys
but then sometimes my mouse would slide and it would bug it out
so id switch to arrow keys
b/c using the mouse to do that shit was next to impossible
b/c using the mouse to do that shit was next to impossible
but it was annoying sometimes b/c of my physical hardware setup playing on pc
i started liking it way more as i played more
for the final fight
since im assuming its different than picking a2
definitely wanna pick 9s for the end of route c
fun game though
yea lol
so broken
especially recovery on kills being like 30%
lifesteal is broken in that game
LMAO
yea same
from what i felt 
it was basically just 2b but more ground focused
i really liked her combat
A2 was just really fun to play tbh
i still used it though
and then sometimes you get 4 randomly
but you actually get like .4 seconds
it just says 4s
yea
but it didnt even work
that gives 4s of invincibility
i found this one anti chain combo item
dumb ass boss
then i just beat him easily the third time
then the next time it was the first thing he did all battle
when he was at 1 hp
he had this one move that just one shot me and i got hit by it the first time
so i had to read it 3 times
especially because i lost to that boss twice :)
i liked that part a ton
the game got real
when he found out the black boxes were just made from machine cores
thats fair
i liked him as a support when i was 2b though
so yea i agree
i guess its better than when i first started playing as him though
he turns into a naruto character lmfao
im not sure if i do or not
okay
even if theyre a little cringey at times
even if theyre a little cringey at times
but overall i like her edgy quotes
its a bold choice
she also doesnt really have clothes on which i can respect
does actual damage too
yea lmao
edgy as fuck
A2 is where its at
makes me want to do the rest of them
thats for damn sure
much better than route b
i finally beat nier route c yesterday
cool
is parsa running it or something
yea but its a different dnd campaign
since thats on saturdays
its not erics dnd tho right
but why did he choose banana bread
im very aware
yes im aware
it just sounds so gay
mars why did he say banana bread of all things
Happy diwali vro haha
Yea
Thats the age old solution
Thats the age old solution
Its gotta
Yea it probably will right
So I was just wondering
Without it
I've never tried it without my lan adapter but I remember mario tennis was decent
So then you're fine
Oh good
Is it laggy for you? I assume you dont have a lan adapter
Yea so weird
Other than a glitch ofc
Because its separate from music
That's literally the only possibility
Did you somehow turn off the sounds setting?
Wait that's very incorrect
Wtf
What? Like no audio?
Yea why wouldnt you
To play smash
Vro I'm picking up jett now
And no its single player unfortunately 
I'm aware
I'll be on in 3
K
What
I think that sets the tone we're setting as a group the best by far
Oh sorry was out
Happy bday btw
Ye
fried or fertilized
Thats the end of it
Looks like
Internet gay
We're about to be on ocean and arizona
Wanna meet up on ocean?

You know it
YUP
Well gnight dude
Ikr haha
Wtf skype
Can you trade now?
Very good for our team comp
Yes
Jett wants to contact you tmrw about making a storm knight
: ^]
Because you were talking to me
Ok thats sick
Fucking parsa man
Ok that sounds good hahaha
When is the session
Fucking parsa man
Yea hes changing it soon
Im js, jett doesnt like being the joke of people
Before you even could
Parsa and eric killed jetts character
That eric fucked up on
It was just the scholar of his people thing
Youre good
Nono
Jett wants eric to catch these hands
Ok im glad we got that resolved
I thought it was you lol
Eric?
Who was it?
Wait
LOL
Hahahahahaha
He became a meme
Ever since the scholar of his people
Hahahaha
"Mars you fucked up my character for me"
Its up to him
And i didnt know how to respond
If he should make a nnew character
He was asking me earlier
Just
Whats the problem then
I was talking with him abt it
Jett says he can roll with not being the last one of his race
Ok ok ok so
Hmmm
Stabs a random civilian with drugs he got from an ally after killing someone
He was a scholar and was a cleric of his people
LOLOL
Hahahhaa
I couldnt take it
Eric and i thought jett was the biggest snowflake ever
I was dying the whole car ride home
Was the scholar of his people
I thought you said that jett
Bro
Im glad you made it work out
I was super tired anyways, so im sure i messed up a little
Thats fine
Ok
But im up
Went to sleep at like 5 am
I uh
For space
But idk you probably need you own
Yea, but he has a stockpile
And even some maps im p sur e
I think eric has resources for tokens
Or rip them from google images/roll20 resource dump
Draw them yourself
You have two options
Well uh
Tile?
Lmk
If you need any help with anything
Incredible
Wow
Imma layout my layout
My layout
Im dropping a plan for my character on ya
At some point tomorrow
i really don't like star wars though
Kk
is that all you got? I could get with it
Because i didnt know how to mute a skype group
But i was an edgy teen and i asked him to kick me
I remember when he added me to that
Is the one on one with uti still active
Im good man
Nah its fine and fun
This was my first one
Im a madman
Ikr!!
Im here ye
Typo
Always
On my phone so i hit o instead of i 
Boutta play some dnd rq
Just chillon rn
Doing well
B/c hes going to huston next week
Probably will be in like 2 weeks tho
Too
He knows the dealer 
Hes down to let us use hos place with him to do somw shrooms
Just talked to matt
Yo
Thanks ill probably play it when i get back home
Tyty
I still need to talk with matt, I messaged him about the hangout
now knows that diego smashed [M]arisa
And so wrong 
After hes stays so stubborn
Its reallt hard to remain composed
I had a feeling you two had been at it for a while 
And it was already so intense
It started so abruptly
That makes a lot more sense
The soundtrack one was at least a discussion, compared to the killing baby Hitler one which was just eric trying to justify the same thing multiple times as you were telling him hes essentially a psychopath
Hmm, those were both "interesting" conversations. 
If it was in the group chat, im gonna go read it
LOL thats exactly whats wrong with him, idk how he can even argue such immorale points so frequently
unfortunately 
and i can't tell if he did or not, all he did was comment about the fact that he's openly gay
that's a pit bull chorus
it does still feel like a very mobile-game type
it does still feel like  very mobile-game type
Unless this is the bs part
I want to tho
Shouldnt be too long though
Im with friends rn
Ill read this in a bit, probably when i get home
Ok that sounds good
LOL
Ok i was thinking about ways to do it
Lemme ask that too
Lemme asl that too
Oh you are ok
Lemme see if people would be down for a daytime sesh
We could do it around noonish
What time?
Aw
About doing*
Yo do you have work tmrw? I was thinking doing dnd tmrw if you dont
I know i fought him a few times but i dont remember if i beat him
Ye its sick
So giving me a rough outline woth some plot points might make it better in everyone elses eyes
But i dont want to have to adjust the story on the spot either
Or the history of the land even 
Like, where in the city certain places are
So having some input in the story will help you be able to shine
Its just that i want your character to be almost the spotlight of your quest 
Yea
Ill make it work
Or choose a favorite of ones youve thought of 
Well i do want more of your input on what samuel will eventually do, so hit me up with more ideas 
And i didnt think your character was boring personally
I was planning on doing your quest first
Oh shit wtf
Lmao ok
Bless
Is the new one in or did your computer just not chimp out?
Congrats

&lt;&lt;&lt; 
I dont open Skype anymore
Yes just last second
Isnt happening
So the main reason I was down to try it
Is it mars dming or eric
Do I really want to do it? Not really
I mean
tho
i liked session 1
EZ
and avoid blame
we can just admit that and move on
by working 20 hrs on this
i think eric just kaboomed his own mental
same ~jett
We can blame eric
Begging :(
Uti sent this to me too, was gonna play it when I got home xd
For the win
Ftw
For the wait
What vro
im not actually good
its all a facade
me after joining the got gud club
me after joining the got gud club
aight lets go fuck up genichiro
it puts you in a pose so that equals posture?
why?
but like
ok thanks
yet i dont doubt you
completely unbelievable
that sounds
interesting
uh huh
so next i get on i'll learn the red letter timings
i was blocking his phase one pattern decently well
aight
and it started a chain reaction of autism
xd
isnt
speculating whether or not i have mikiri counter
ty thats actually helpful
ok
during the red letter phases?
maybe thats cheesing it
i dont even know if they have one
i still never learned the abyss watchers pattern
aka learning the attack pattern
i will beat genichiro by cheesing him
i beat the abyss watchers by getting good
you guys jump to the wildest conclusions
yea thats the only option
i get the parry and just reset the situation
i cannot react to parries
but the issue is
and mash
im actually kinda clean at that
i do that often
oh
but what is this dark art you speak of
i parry kinda well
oh?
but i only tried to beat him twice since ive gotten there
im better at the game
im back at genichiro
i can get within two inches of them before they notice me
i can get within two inches of them before they notice me
they literally stand there afk
ashina guards suck anyways
Big pog?
Fk bitch
Oh
Ulmos chillin at 8
Who be this tanky
Whomst
Ok
cutting my losses early
i think she's more useful tbh
im aware that this is dundee's canon ending
This is tremendous
come, bool
you guys in a game yet
or w/e theyre called
and got some heart of the seas
we found a ton of treasure maps last night
ooh cool
xd
by doing nothing
I somehow hid the other chat
xd
boys we here
anyone busy at 2 or around 2
ok 2 works for me
that was only slightly absurd
how is that our squad
michael
gotcha
like 20 hours
how you feel about tmrw at like 1:30/2
negus
Camsl Sharpainsl
sl
I could whip it up and whip it out by then
no idea, you guys free this weekend
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
aight boys you ready
I've decided this 
But vros we are starting at 1:30
The fires are crazy
yeee boy
vro
B R O O J
doog
we all good with 1?
we can start at 1 sure
KappaRoss
Keepo
if we need to b/c of erics
ok im down for 12
but I think 2 is optimal
unless we're tryin to start at 4 or smth
so what time works best for everyone between there
and 12 at the earliest
we should start at like 2 at the latest
im sayin
Edited previous message: not that it would end at 2, but the latest we try to start is 2
no parsa
not that it would nd at 2, but the latest we try to start is 2
to start
how about we aim for like 12-2
um hmm
lets go
we're doin tomorrow then
congrats!
&gt;we didn't do dnd today because of educational commitments XD
as a temp character
you can play over break with us
yea...
I think everyone is either neutral or good
it looks good
ye
he just msgd me about it
Friday is a "in case everyone isn't tired or busy" alternative
Monday is the main plan
double actually
since we should all be free monday evening, we'll save it as a backup plan
well we'll see
its a whole new world of excitement
when you fall asleep
same
indeed it is not
thought it was friday
not tonight
I meant friday
Edited previous message: or do you guys just want to do it late friday? Miles probably won't get home till like 10:45
so itd be a real nibba hours session
or do you guys just want to do it late tonight? Miles probably won't get home till like 10:45
and mars is free
so none of us have class
its a holiday afterall
monday?
hm
cant do sunday at any time?
either way works, now we wait
oh perfect
but are you going home that day parsa? I feel like you would be
since veterans day is the next day
I think sunday is good
old skype is all ive got
im in too deep
except I cant vote because im on old skype
so we vote!
gotcha
is it?
evening time
we all available tomorrow?
my dad said he'd leave tomorrow, so I can do it at home
will do
i'll let you guys know tmrw
does this not work
so ONLY IF he's leaving Saturday morning
and he'd be pretty upset at me if I left
well actually, if my dad does end up leaving on Saturday morning i'd like to spend some time with him Friday night
Kappa
idk you might not make it
I want everyone here session one obviously
you guys down for Friday still?
nice
that sounds good with me
ok
so in 2 days
y
this frida
and I don't want him hearing me dm
no its that he lives in my room on jetts old bed
and my dad should be gone
since there wont be classes in session
but sunday is the day before veterens day if you guys wanna try for that
ok so Friday might not work b/c my dad might still be here
: )
it looks really interesting
I wanna try it
how do you guys feel about a hexagon grid for combat
also
yes
alright lol
makes sense
nah but ok
Mars still needs a picture, and eric and parsa still need alignments
Every character is pretty much done, so im letting you guys see them 
I showed him what hes playing
we had the wrong miles
guys
vros
CAMPAIGN SOON
got a genius idea
or not
mars do you still want me to make you a character
Edited previous message: miles can you join the roll20 so I can give you your assigned character
after I make it
miles can you join the roll20 so I can give you assign you your character
we got this Friday open then!
oh cool
: ^)
also, i'd recommend some survival skills
so it'll be sometime next week
he said he was leaving tmrw but things are different now
so Friday aint gonna happen
I just realized my dad isn't ACTUALLY leaving before friday
we can do it Friday, but Michael is gonna be on a plane or smth right?
yea
done my guy
Only men
No women, theyre too gay
sounds good
aight
so make him flat broke at the time of the draft and we're good
in theory
to dodge a draft
Its okay if hes not wealthy enough
xDDDDDDDDdd
lol
like no god bloodline or smth
from anything but race and class
as long as the memes don't give your character some power over others
we can meme it up
that's all im saying
theres a homebrew class called dino rider
up to you
either or
and it'll make sense as time goes on
these are fucking hilarious lol
actually if you do want a homebrew im completely okay with it
outside of what ive already said
before it started
would set peoples mind into an idea
yea I felt like giving it a name
indeed!
and efficient!
its very useful!
Edited previous message: 
lul
I somehow missed the invite button
oh
how abt this one
Edited previous message: 
but knock yourself out
idk if this link works
i'll set up the roll20 soon
ok cool
lvl 2
That's all.
Ok guys if you do want to make a character here are the guidelines:
Any race from the wiki idgaf.
Any of the main classes, if you really want a homebrew lmk.
You are all soldiers who were drafted against your will. You don't expect much to happen in your future, so you shouldn't have some glorious goal you want your character to fulfil. You should have a relatively tame background, as, since you've been drafted, you probably didn't have the must luxurious or amazing life before this.
5 sounds gr8 to me
so far
you Michael miles mars and eric have said that they want to
about the campaign
but what I meant is that i'm going to put information in here soon
no im just saying that this is the dnd chat
its about as close as Rohit ever got
sprbb
this is chat vros
vros
vrs
its looking better and better
okk vros the outline is forming
have a nice day
understandable
3
yes
the time frame is still 2-4 weeks
do you wanna be in it
my question is more or less
kaapxed
1

so who would want to play this campaign
its revived
dnd groups boys
RIP IN PEACE
tmrw

YIKES
Pakka
That video is nearly 3 hours long
Holy shit dude

^
I think
2:15 to 3:45
I have class on Thursdays now
I'm just not going to answer.

at smc
ow
i'll let you know tomorr
on the Tuesday Thursday block
i have classes and i need to crash another one
I should be able to, but I need to double check with my schedule tomorrow
: ^)
mars are you working every other day?
its not going to change
still
for thursdays
parsa that means that eric saves all his work to do on the board game
on a certain day
this is why I said that we need to be okay with leaving someone out
how about friday
yoinks
^
it could for sure
things
type
we've gotta start eating robot
we're in modern times now
eating babies is so 2nd century
that's a little dictatorship-like

Probably the nest available day
Not today, i need to do stuff for school tomorrow
Oh it skipped because i typed perfect
Theres just too many messages to scroll through 
Thx 
My phone skype is unusable in this chat now
it should be another edgy piece of shit
honestly goddess olive shouldn't be there
but braccus is nothing like goddess olive
Edited previous message: and that's the relationship of hector and vaughan
and much like this group of people, braccus hasn't really started to fit in yet much like Goddess olive has nothing to do with this group
eao is mistress most badass
Unka is kyle
Vix has to be Twisted Shawn the Dark One
and that's the relationship of hector and caughan
b/c twitchy carl likes anything that psymon likes
because Vaughan has to be twitchy carl
I think hector has to be Psymon
: ^(
woah
mars that's hard
YIKES
ok please
ok
: ^)
I'll assume because its in color
Why can't I see what you guys are typing?
aka mars
or is not on do not disturb
I pity anyone who doesn't have this chat muted
hm
Yikes
same
I gotta import a few more files
ok enough from me
xd
after hitting it a certain way, he realizes this is not what he needs, therefore he must try to hit it in a better way without making it unusable
yea, for unka it would be more like trial and error
would need a roll
yea but the accuracy of the pattern
yes
or "shaping patterns"
it simply says you can "create shapes"
well since the spell doesn't say anything about precision, you'd certainly need to roll to see how precise you are
he doesn't actually touch the dirt
I would say casting the molds would be wis, as he is a caster
assembling it would
Edited previous message: I mean, when it was initially invented I'm certain they didn't get it right in one try
I mean, when it was initially inventing I'm certain they didn't get it right in one try
but you don't even have this most basic reference
ik its not too complicated
its not like the sterling engine was made in one go
it'd take experimenting from both of you
the type of metal
the thickness
you couldn't know the measurements first try
i'd say you would only be able to conceptualize the idea of what you want
well it'd all be about how well you roll the molds eric
just let us know
alright parsa that should fine
hmm
is far more difficult to understand
but the concept of an engine
I think you guys would understand how steam flows and creates pressure etc
Edited previous message: well clearly you guys HAVE thought of the concept of an engine 
you'd just have no idea how to make it work
well clearly you guys HAVE though of the concept of an engine
for a druid whos never seen one before, it could prove to be difficult
that'd be the challenging part
you'd need to get the mold perfect though
you cant be off by too much
relatively wide, id say
its not like you'd get it right everytime
so would you though
yea he'd have to roll super well
anythings possible there
you guys are heading to the capital soon
it wouldn't just be one run through
it would just take a long time for him to understand it
I think he could assemble it
yea if someone could explain to unka how to do it
it's gonna be incredible
we're gonna have an assembly race
ohhh no
no, do it later
: ^)
I think he could if he has proficiency in it
hahahaha
then we'll see
just so theres no bias
probably decide everything on rolls
i'd love to see competition between the two engine tyrants
Maybe unka could try to build an engine as well
100%
I would
I think a magical steam engine would be far more efficient than a material based one
LMAOOO
you need to acquire the materials, understand them (the int check) assemble them (dex check)
its not an int check, it requires multiple checks
no I think it is better if they quantifying measurement has been widely accepted
it'd take a while
you can try to do that
well it does, it overwhelms people like my mother
yea but why make it so complicated
Edited previous message: marketing logic to the illogical is illogical
market logic to the illogical is illogical
its just illogical to market it like that since average people are illogical
I mean, it works too
Michael gets it
yup
^
they just care about it in relation to other cars on the market
but average people don't care about what they're buying to exact measurements
but its all related to other measures of horsepower
together it either means "really strong" or "sorta strong"
and the number means how strong
its just about sounding strong
but its really not about the horses
from what I'm getting
only you cant
but I can relate to it
Edited previous message: mike yeung has a fucking fidget spinner
I hate everything
mike yung has a fucking fidget spinner
eric it just seems like you have a hard time relating to horsepower
b/c you can make more money with the term
yea which is why its superior
its bad marketing
that's too sciency for dumbasses in Arkansas
yea but we dont
whenever they hear the word said
so they have a good estimate
and everyone in America has grown up with horsepower
because its way easier to relate to
I agree, but the term has its uses
not all, but most
ie mechanics and their friends
most people who are "car guys" tend to be common people anyways
erics trolling
very often
high horsepower trucks at dumb people
eric they wouldn't understand that
its for dumb people to relate to
that's the reason the term still exists
but he's seen a horse
he's got no idea what that means
not for joe in Kentucky
but its easy to understand based on the words its made of
which is why its stuck around
its just relatable
because it isnt
I'm not even saying the the meaning behind the word is logical
aka construction workers
for moving/lifting
most people who care about horsepower are people buying trucks
I disagree
not often
its not relatable
when was the last time you've seen a torque
b/c we see them draw carriages
everyone knows roughly how strong a horse is
theres nothing relatable about the word torque
which is better than not knowing what torque is at all
compared to the engine
they just think it has to do with the strength of horses
they don't know what it is
yea but the concept of horsepower means something to common people
which wasn't stated
unless we're talking globally
talking about americans
I'm implying that we're in america
since china doesn't apply rn
well we're talking about americans
most americans are stupid dude
you know
^
I think torque is more obscure than horsepower for a common person to understand
that would ultimately be the deciding factor
and whether or no deja vu was playing
depends on how well you train it
yea
no
you'll be stuck there for a very long time
don't go to jail
basically
please no more
so you'll be without vaughan
no jett tho
tmrw is the day of days

I am perplexed at how rapildy my autism can increase after a neurological hit.

It was like it was just sitting there, waiting. 

When I was 14, a seris of events hit which caused neuro compromise. And the autism just exploded. Prior to that, it was quite mild if at all. 

Then, after the accident, it went crazy. I thought it was just the head injury, but the neuro cog testing after a year was A-OK. 

So they said, "You have autism, no?"

"Um,,, yes, but not really."

"Ummm, REALLY" they said. 

By it going crazy, I mean I acquired new autism symtpoms I never had that I thought were just MTBI symptopms. 

Like prosopagnosia, and losing memoriy, and lost skills. 

Has anyone else had autism just sitting there and gettign way worse after a neuro event? 

I might add that I endured some horrific emotional events which did NOT make the autism worse, but surely exacerbated the other conditions like PTSD

But the neuro parts of autism have now gone nuts. 

Makes me scared to age. How many old people have autism and are misdced as dementia?
im alive
I'm awake
i haven't got food yet
I need food

hell no
id need to boot it up

but we could start after that
well idk I have some last minute work to do anyways

And the next session could be this weekend or maybe even friday evening if i finish my worldbuilding fast enough
This map isnt finished because you didnt get a completed map from the camp, so you still dont know what a few landmarks or cities are
this is the most updated map as of now.
theres a difference
that's intentionally trash
stop sharing trash content
hello vro
vros updated map found in the rubble at the dracolich/work camp site

Guys
LUL
lazy remasters
old games lul
dang

that's fucking lame
are your sensitivities off?
RIP
whats wrong with them?
yes
is 2 worth 10 bucks though
SO IT IS
Competitiveness in video games has devolved into getting the best randomly spawned weapons and pub stomping all the noobs with pistols
BATTLE ROYALS AND STORY GAMES ONLY
YUP
OOF
telling you rn revert everything that didn't work since s4
xd
but that only worked towards killing it
s2-4 not much changed outside of trinkets
it wasn't as bad in s5-7 but it was still bad
especially recently
yUP
the world is right once more
everyone comes back
where they revert a ton of shit
league is gonna release a s4 patch
that battle royals are gonna die
I'm telling you rn
Better than the aatrox rework?
Woah!
not sure
Tmrw jam?
not sure
clearly
Philip is Jack-Jack mixed with the dumpling kid from the short before incredibles 2
he's so EPIC
XD
aight
at samo mountains?
not big boy camping
keep it simple camping
Sounds good to me
I'm down if you are
I have no idea
you gotta conquer cletus
I like best
OOF
aids
ikr
b/c of it
: ^)
I've learned to type
I think she said 6 people max
the alley is free tho
but I can only have 5 people over.
im trying to invite some people over tomorrow but my mom said no smoking in the house
I'm kinda sick otherwise I would
we can just get high
and instead of camping
that's always a good idea
same
it doesn't have to be big boy camping
I'm still down to do some casual camping
rip
yea
We rescheduling? Kappa
So uhhhh
I guess we could try to dip sunday night, im just worried that some of us might be hung over or intoxicated
I'm actually not sure how you didn't know that unless you never read anything I wrote in this chat
I've said it was the 22nd to the 25th for nearly 2 months now
is what I'm getting from my research
the reservable ones are typically way more crowded
almost every campsite is first come first serve
22nd
I need motivation too lol, i dont want to just decide on a place for everyone
We still camping, honestly i just need help making a decision
Same
Ill do it tomorrow
Im here but i have not yet
Michael do you want to go to the angeles national rainforest?
Ye
I just didn't want him to feel left out yknow
that's fine then
ok
doesn't matter
no space anyways so w/e
if he did
idk
and we're only supposed to have 8 people per campsite
he'll figure it out eventually
in the chat w/ parsa
stop typing about camping
guys
Holy fuck
I think were going to angeles
hitting the whole bowl without sharing is greedy
I know what it says
yuh
OH

big sur = big gay
where we could just get high and fuck off
theres some sweet spots in the forest
the more I look at it
I'm liking angeles
xD!
you're autistic
look through these and tell me which ones look nice
sure, for a bit
even if i have to pay for it
and i'd like to reserve it anyways
theres definitely more than 7
me too
and live a little
smoke and take shrooms
we could fuck off into some shrubs and trees
yea it is
lol
and that
yea
so we should go camping in a forest
we don't live in a forest
we all already live by the beach, so that is sort of a nonfactor
the reason why people like big sur so much is because its by the beach
made me realize that the angeles national forest is the best place for us to go
and you know what that did for me?
I just took a refreshing shower
i assume the free ones will be very crowded though
we almost did!
or not and maybe I'm just retarded
and saying names we already know
instead of just speculating
dang we gotta do some real research
me too
if we can find something we agree on
and I'm willing to reserve the campsite early on my card
big sur would be great though, considering the time of year we're going
Michael said he liked cheap things
it'd definitely be affordable
yea ik
over three days yea
it can be a little pricey
that could theoretically just be for us
theres private campsites
so did david
in 1 minute
last night
i found some
but if we wanna go angeles I could
I'm not against big sur personally
I thought you were trolling
oh
don't do this
Michael no
no
no
I prefer PepePls
I hate
beats Joshua trees 100
and its only gonna be like 85 in the summer apparently
hell yea
just normally people aren't as down for a 6 hour drive
I'm not saying you wouldn't be able to drive there
its just annoying i guess
yea the drive is still the biggest problem
if we find something perfect, that is
I'm sure we can change it to a later date if need be
currently
the weekend of june 22nd is what we're shooting for
i looked for like 1 minute
yea its surprisingly not that hard to find one
our planned weekend was booked on the nicer site, but the ones before and after it weren't surprisingly
found one that was private and one that was public
but I'm glad no one else can
well i actually found a site at big sur that wasn't filled relatively easily
Yosemite cant be much cheaper
just expensive
that wouldn't have been that outrageous i guess
oh
or per car or what
is that per person?
next
incredible
unfortunately
its still a reasonably long drive
well i mean, we could check them
yea I'm actually down
but its not bad
is pretty gay
camping in what is basically LA
its really close too
i think I'm down for that one
Edited previous message: and angeles national forest idk I guess that ones fine
and angeles national park idk I guess that ones fine
buberfuck north isn't a thing
Joshua tree is 100 degrees in late june every day
weren't good
the options on that poll
the thing is
we arent
no I'm pretty sure
that's what happened to matthew
national law is harsher if they find anything drug related on you
yes
...vro
.
what a wonderful time of day
hey!
HEY
In case of the worst though
ik
yea
honestly, anything with the word national is far more sketch
in the off chance the worst happens
the only thing is, since we'll have weed drinks and shrooms, we should avoid national forests
Ill do it when i get home
I haven't voted yet
S a m e
Ill be home soonish
S a m e
Just got home
Ill play soon michael
But we all have to commit to it
Well anyways, if we are gonna backpack we need to pack lightly
: ^)
:^)
Im riding in erics car then
S a m e
Id say its retro stylish
Make it stylish
We could at least bring a flask
Michael lmao
If not its joshathans fault
Im gonna look at more campsites
So in case we want to go somewhere else
I'm good with j tree honestly
with places you think are good
digbo write up a vote page
where at
the beach??
Joshua tree?
lets settle this shit
where we going guys
america
bless
if we're allowed to just get our own spot
backpacking is cool though
I was thinking we would just get a campsite
we can go to the indian place for lunch
when we're leaving
maybe like the last day
or something else good
but i'd like to try the indian place one day
no ofc we aren't going to exclusively eat restaurant food
if we need to pack lighter
or two
we could just eat there one of the days
Joshua tree does have eating there
ik eric has a car
we just wont let him near the stash
yea probably tbh
Edited previous message: un caro es problema
in caro es problema
2
yea
yea
we can just go to Joshua tree
vros
I EXIST
so I'm sold
and she said Joshua tree
I talked to my mom about this once
alright boys
Aye
Joshua tree is 94 in the day in june on average
i'll have to understand the weather
Joshua tree is nice but
yet
its not worth it
i really don't want to be in 95-100 degree weather
I meant the day though
its cold at night
in the summer
I don't really wanna go to a desert
it'd be fun on shrooms
I wouldn't be against it if we wanna go there
but carillo is a good start
for recommendations
who's camped everywhere in cali
I was gonna call my aunt
so digbo can go to class on tuesday
and get back Monday night
spend the weekend there
that way we can leave friday
is june 22nd
so the planned date as of right now
okay boys
hot?!?!
we could, maybe something on top too
its true
ye
I'm not invested so I want out
Gemi was fun because I was allowed to play how I wanted, but I also don't want to play gemi again.
don't press him.
let him speak for himself
Jett isn't me
Im starting to lose steam and interest in this campaign
Im starting to lose steam and interest in thos campaign

Mujin Fuu follows the teachings of his sensei:
"We must be swift as the coursing river
With all the force of a great typhoon
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon"

Sunday is dad's day, but im good on the evening
Thursday is a okay
So lets do that instead
And watch incredibles
Well honestly id rather hang out with uti and everyone on monday
And invite eric to come as well
We could just do it a bit later and have dnd on tuesday
You'll have to figure it out my dude
Up to you dude
Oh gotcha
On monday
So are you working for your dad?
In sure he wants to see it
Instead
On monday
And see incredibles with eric too
We can try and play dnd on tuesday
For incredibles and dnd
Oh i see
Oh
Why?
For incredibles and dnd
So monday works
So it works then
Yeah i thought so
Mars is this what you meant by plans on monday?
Yeah so it doesn't seem like a scheduling issue
Night time right

So, yes
I can probably do monday night, nothings stopping me
RIP
Perfect
Same
I do not know anything of this mysterious land, i wish only to achieve my goal and the goals of the party
that's not good enough

when it was " x in 2016 lul"
I miss the old days
lul
got back
he just
lul
yea
jett is at rehearsal
ye
we need less water breaks
it was ok
try it
garlic, olive oil, half a sweet onion, can of peeled roma tomatoes, salt, pepper, herbs du province, hot Italian sausage, red wine, balsamic vinegar, and a bit of cheese on top of a rigatoni pasta
and itsl ike 15 bucks to feed 3
ever
its my favorite meal
i like Bolognese with Italian hot sausage and balsamic vinegar w/ red wine
when you make it right
and its good
is cheap
yea but pasta and sauce
but its good
is cheap
like pasta
cheap can be good sometimes
i like food with salt and pepper
so its a palate thing
food with low quality ingredients does the same
tastes like food with expensive ingredients
food with expensive ingredients
im afk
.
im a middleman
i like middle food
i don't really like cheap food
and some people like that flavor better
no i said expensive food tastes like expensive food
im right
fuck erics article
fuck this article
im right about this
but some people like that
its just rarer and therefore more expensive
i don't really like truffle salt that much
if you like truffle salt you'll like expensive food more
most expensive food uses truffle salt
same as expensive food
cheap food uses the same ingredients as other cheap food
just flavor
but not quality of flavor
price = flavor
and some people like them better
just they taste different
doesn't mean theyre better
if you have them often
so you can recognize them
b/c expensive ingredients taste a certain way
ill agree with that
price has a flavor
in a way
yea your box is nice things
why would i want to be sad with what i eat
since most people cant afford the nicer thing anyways
isn't that a good thing for most people
mostly scent
and scent
in flavor
boxes are a little too construction paper like for me
instead of like a bottle
boxed water tastes like the box
and tell me if its old salt or new salt
of league
i want you to taste the salt
im done with my essay
wanna play some league
vros
at
i wish i could buy wine a 20
wine training means you've been trained to detect the differences
wine is a little steeper tho
from my experience
but 40 is like the same as 100
b/c you can get really incredible stuff for like 20 bucks
than what it does
but it should scale a little better
it doesnt
ik ik
but its maybe 1.3x better
you would expect a 100 dollar burger to be 5x better than a 20 dollar burger
its not worth it
but proportionate to the 100 dollar thing
i mean theyre really good
theyre w/e
ive been to those 100 dollar burger places
fuck i feel bad now
i hate vro
looked weird
it just
ikik

For me
Not a caster this time
At worst id play a paladin
Say lilith went to terrorize somewhere else
We can just give up our pursuit of lilith and do the rest
Also if there were any more i think 5 should be the cap, and who would it be?
I wanna write a storyline based off yugioh
But i dont mind continuing at all
Byt i dont mind continuing at all

btw apparently theyre as strong as a fucking polar bear
perfect
make them CR 20 with the ability to fly
you should buff plesiosaurs is what I'm really getting at
those things would fuck you up if you got in the water with them
idk man

but it should be like
???
how the fuck is that menace a fucking cr of 2
theyre really shit
gemi's worshipping him as we speak
he's our lord and saviour
he's staying
we're just gonna roast it a bit out of love
^
that makes it looks weird
like the other monsters are
but its just the way that it isn't layered into the map
I mean, don't remove it now that its become something
otherwise the map is great
is what I was getting at
it just looks a little out of place
my man
a plesiosaur
wtf is this
only one small problem
for how the world looks
its much better than what we've previously had as reference
I like it though

10/10 timing

yea!!
o
what is that
wow 4e races had so many more racial buffs
it works a lot better than high elf
yea, I like it
good word
eladrin good
but now they just have wings and resistance to radiant/necrotic
in old editions aasimars had a ton of actives

all the townswomen

"gemi chance is so hot"
"damn hes so brave"
they'll think
to any onlooker that sees shadow gemi in the front lines

:thinking:
and had two moms?
could it be she's adopted
cheqir doesn't even remember having a father
cheqir's mom is big gay
more jobs more pay
gemi isn't salty, he's just ready to solicit more from the emperor
and phoenix down
compared to legendary action boots
but the ioun stone is lackluster
gemi likes the emperor more than most
gay
lemi :^)
I'm here when miles is
it happens
your god/goddess gives you strength
you pray or raise a holy symbol
cleric magic is simple
at all
but not arcane
and understands it pretty much in full
gemi has full confidence in his cleric magic
he'll get it after a while
it just takes time with him
gemi isn't very smart, but he's wise
just scrolls
no
tfw mars takes a DEADASS long rest
but i feel like rugs are part of furniture

no plants ur gay
no rug no pay

for killing him
do we even get the rugs
we kill him and we get to have our rugs(?)

Edited previous message: with $900000

those bars are pretty massive
of the blade is 5ft
oh
is that for all 7 charges?
it'd be a stopping point so you don't lose the handle of the blade
assuming its spinning, when does someone get hit by the middle of the projectile. if its not spinning it probably want make it all the way through, like mars pointed it
what?
and act like a real dick
is rest it over someones neck
the best you could do with the bottom of the blade
yea
but shits already dead at that point
it would make it more painful if you ever got to those spikes
100%
barbs
the stuff on the bottom
he could just be endlessly slicing
but who says he's stabbing?
mars is right
nothing gets caught
its easier to remove a smooth knife than a serrated one from a block of bread
but that's not when you pierce someone, that's when you slice to cut off a part of something
and me to downs mode
